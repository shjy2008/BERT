4 ||| So sorry I didn't purchase this years ago when it first came out!!  This is very good and entertaining!  We absolutely loved it and anticipate seeing it repeatedly.  We actually wore out the cassette years back, so we also purchased this same product on cd.  Best purchase we made out of all!  Would purchase on dvd if we could find one.
4 ||| Believe me when I tell you that you will receive a blessing watching this video of the Cathedral Quartet.  They bring back most of the singers that were ever in their group and it is a really great VHS.
4 ||| I have seen X live many times, both in the early days and their more recent reunion shows. Trust me when I say this: they never disappoint as a live band! This DVD document of a show on their home turf of LA is a dream come true. Can't wait.
4 ||| I was so excited for this!  Finally, a live concert video from X!  I've seen them twice, both times with Tony G. on guitar (he was superb by the way).  But we all know you HAVE to have Billy Zoom in the band. I haven't been able to see them, but this DVD will do the trick.  This DVD is AMAZING!! One listen/viewing makes me instantly forget all the "power pop" "punk" bands that are around now.  Their sound is fantastic, full, fast, heavy, thrilling!  All the members sound excellent, period.  I'm hopeful that there will be a tour, come on X!  Us old fogeys would like to see you old fogeys play your beautiful music for us!! UPDATE:  I've been so lucky to catch X a couple of times with Billy on guitar since I wrote this, it was just incredible seeing them, this DVD does give an accurate view of what it is like to have X RIPPING it up in concert!  cheers.
4 ||| X is one of the best punk bands ever. I don't even like calling them a punk band, but that's what they call themselves so I guess it's OK. This is musically complex punk with a lot of influences and a lot of tight playing and gripping tunes.  This is an awesome concert. The only two problems are that 1) it is just 67 minutes long and 2) John Doe's bass is buried too deep in the mix.  Every X fan should get this. More importantly, anyone who doesn't know about X should get this.  Why X? Did you know, for example, that: - X has a different sound based on the unique harmonies between co-lead singers Exene Cervenka and John Doe that really sets them apart from anything else out there? - Doe, Cervenka and drummer DJ Bonebrake also play in the country punk band The Knitters? - Billy Zoom, the guitarist who originally formed the band, used to play rockabilly guitar for Gene Vincent and other big stars, and has been voted one of the greatest guitar players ever by Guitar Player magazine? - X were playing Leadbelly tunes way before Kurt Cobain? - Ray Manzarek, keyboard player of The Doors, produced X's first four albums? This is one of the big reasons why the band covered and generally closed its concerts with "Soul Kitchen" from the album&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Doors/dp/B000MCIBE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Doors</a> - Cervenka and Doe used to be married, before Exene later married Viggo Mortensen -- Aragorn from the Lord of the Rings movies? - Billy Zoom left the band from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, but during this time the band still managed to record&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/X-Live-at-the-Whisky-a-Go-Go/dp/B000005IRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">X Live at the Whisky a Go-Go</a>, one of the greatest live rock albums ever, with guitarist Tony Gilkyson?  As this DVD proves, X is still as good as ever. Billy Zoom still plays standing in his trademark splayed-leg stance with a broad grin on his face. Did I say he is awesome? Awesome.  I waited way too long before getting this one, thinking I could do without an X DVD. And I could have. But why should I? This really is worth it, and I'm sure I'll be putting this one in the player more often than a lot of my other music DVDs. Really, really good.
4 ||| I've loved X since I first saw them here in San Francisco with, I believe, Devo and Romeo Void.  Romeo Void was a disaster due to the tiny outfit Deborah squeezed her huge body into; the audience couldn't stand to look at her even when the music was good. Devo was quite good. Then X came on stage and it was like hearing a great music system play compared to a tinny radio's sound. Man, they were great and they, unlike 99% of the other "new wave/punk" bands of the era were pros.  They had it down and played it up. I loved them! Watching this excellent reunion video (yes, Billy Zoom still has that same perpetual, inane smile on his face while playing), I was surprised to see very much the same show I saw all those years ago, with some extra songs that came out later, that is. The band's still electrifying. I'd like to see them "live" again, but until then, this video is the next best thing. It's well filmed and has a great selection of their best songs. Sure, they aren't as "pretty" as they used to be, but before you say too much, check your rearview mirror to see how you look now compared to 20 some odd years ago. Then, once humbled, go buy this CD. You will love it!
4 ||| I must admit I was hesitant to purchase this DVD. A classic punk band performing twenty plus years later, what could one expect? Apparently, one can expect a hell of a lot. These guys and gal can still tear their songs apart.  It's well filmed; there isn't that MTV, rapid editing that can cause seizures. The audio is excellent; you can actually understand the lyrics. It's well mixed. It's far superior to a lot of live performance DVD's currently released by some bands. X released a product that is worthy of ones money.  If you like X; you'll love this DVD. If you just appreciate a good rock/punk concert, you won't be disappointed.
4 ||| The little ones love this
2 ||| Good songs. The DVD is a little boring.
4 ||| The DVD came in great condition and provided lots of entertaining minutes of reliving the past.  Definitely worth the money.
4 ||| Watch this and learn how we ended up in the state we are in as a dying country.
3 ||| REALLY ENJOYED
4 ||| excellent as usual
4 ||| A great read.  So much historical info.  Thank you,
4 ||| Should be a must read
4 ||| Well done video with important information that Americans should know.
1 ||| While there was a lot of information in this piece (some of it coming at your faster than a freight train, another down side of the video), there is no doubt that it was produced as right-wing propaganda, which means I'm not able to use it as I hoped (for my children's home schooling). One large section of the video is a series of quotes from historical U. S. leaders, mentioning God and/or the Bible -- the quotes are simply inserted without any background or even a common-ground to relate each of them.
4 ||| There is an essential message here that is not being told in society today.  People claim that this nation was not founded on Christianity, and that the writers of the Constitution were actually Deists rather than Christians.  There is a preponderance of evidence over centuries of time presented here, including the wording of documents such as the Mayflower Compact, that establish the Christian heritage of this nation unapologetically beyond refute, as a matter of history.  The other story that is not being told is the origins and destructive objectives of organizations such as Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  The founder of Planned Parenthood was interested in eugenics, and specifically in reducing the number of Blacks to survive being born in this country.  Efforts by the ACLU to remove prayer and the Bible from school are shown to be in direct conflict with the statements by the founding fathers about what they considered to be essential for a proper education that would equip the youth of this country for effective citizenship.  The redefinition of marriage to include homosexual relationships is shown to be tearing at the fabric of the traditional family, and of the stability of our society.  We HAVE become A Nation Adrift, and much of that comes from ignorance of how this country was founded, and of the sacrifices that were made along the way.  This DVD would be beneficial for viewing in every home, school, and church in this country.
3 ||| Haters will say this is biased, that the founding fathers were not christians, or that they were deists...and maybe that's true for some of the ff. But this documentary is very informative. Our nation started as something it is most certainly not anymore. And we are falling. This movie gives insight as to why.
4 ||| What a great video that gives the early history of our great country!  I'd highly recommend this to everyone - especially for school children that are not learning the history of our country.
3 ||| This video presents a very good capsular History of our country and its founding principles.  It the progresses on through the history of america and how the fabric of what once made her an unusual nation began to deteriorate.  America was founded through a war that broke the shackles of a tyrant King George and on the basis of religious freedom. Many were still not free and so a second war would ensue .  Family, Faith, personal responsibility, generosity, work, morality, integrity and freedom are all part of that legacy.  Oven the decades those have been eroded.  This is the story of how and when it happened.
4 ||| I found this dvd put together with historical facts and visuals that kept my interest in the issues discussed. would recommend 6-12 grade classes watching this.
4 ||| Well done!  I will definitely be showing this to my children when they get a little older.  This is the documentary you will never see in our public school system these days.  Ironically, it is the one documentary that you should have to see before you graduate.  It is amazing how far our country has fallen from the original intentions of our Founding Fathers.  This is a great reminder of what liberalism and political correctness has done to the United States of America.
4 ||| Really excellent piece of work showing the beliefs of the founding fathers and what is happening now to our nation.
4 ||| Of course it's impossible to separate Henry Winkler from his famous Fonzie persona, but he actually does a great job as a Scrooge-character in this movie.  His performance is quiet and subdued, not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor.  I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser. Actually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved, and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.  I believe that's why he does rolls like this so well. I was quite surprised to find this movie available on DVD and have gladly purchased it to add to my collection of Christmas movies.
4 ||| When this first aired in 1979, I enjoyed it so much I clean forgot it was "A Christmas Carol".  I wanted to see it over and over again thoughout the year.  When I finally got a copy on VHS, I got that wish.  Now I finally got the DVD copy and am I glad.  To see Henry Winkler as the best Scrooge or variation on him since Alistair Sim in the 1951 version now on DVD is a treat for the gods.  Although I have both the 1984 and 1999 made for television films made with George Scott and Patrick Stewart on DVD, this version was the first attempt to bring the classic Dickens tale to the small screen. It is as just as enjoyable today as it was 20 plus years ago, and this way it will live forever.  Get it now and on disc before it gets away.
2 ||| If you already have (and love) the Alistair Sim version (Scrooge, 1951), the Reginald Owen version (1938) and Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol (no, I'm not kidding, it's beautifully done), this will be an interesting film for comparison. Two good points stand out for this version of Dicken's classic Christmas story: 1) Since it is an adaptation, set in a different time and place from the original (Depression-era New England), deviations from the text and basic plot-line, are not as bothersome as they are in the films that adapt the story in "Dickensian" England. 2) Henry Winkler, who, at the time, was playing against his well-known Fonz character, gives an excellent characterization to the Scrooge-like Benedict Slade. George C. Scott and Albert Finney give detailed performances as Scrooge in their version, and the films that feature them have good production values -- and, in the case of the Finney version a couple of good songs -- but the deviations in text in the Scott version and the added material in the Finney version (Scrooge in hell -- what?) are both unnecessary and more than a little annoying.
3 ||| Henry Winkler proves his acting ability in this American version of the Dickens classic. One will actually forget that he was 'The FONZ' and will be amazed at his transformation from nice guy to mean guy back to nice guy. The general feel of this movie, though, is grey. That's the best way to describe it. But then, it was a bleak grey time in American history, with the Great Depression and all. When Dickens originally wrote the book, it was a grey time in England's history as well, so the subdued feeling one gets while watching this 'modern' version fits in well with the spirit of the original story. A nice twist (sorry, Oliver!) to a true classic. By the way, for my money, the finest original version out there is the George C. Scott version followed closely by Alistair Sim.
3 ||| Being a huge fan of this classic, I own dozens of versions and this one  adds a nice variety.  The twists and changes to this timeless story truly  do justice to the original and the performances, for the most part, are  stellar.  If you're looking for the same feel good movie but in a new  setting, this one's for you.
4 ||| as described
4 ||| A good movie with morals
4 ||| Love the movie.
4 ||| This TV movie brought back fond memories of the first time my wife and I watched it in the late 70's. Henry Winkler did a great job with the character of an American Scrooge. It was radical change from the Fonz.
4 ||| More of a 'modern' version of the classic.  I didn't think I'd be impressed when my parents took this out but I gave it a try and have to say...what a great adaptation.  The cast was great, Winkler was exceptional.  I was very happy to see this on Amazon and happened to catch it when the price went way down so I snapped it up.  Great timeless classic...and Winkler really surprised me with his portrayal.
4 ||| Perfect!
4 ||| A rare classic,  a good movie.
4 ||| The Christmas Carol is my all time favorite story.  I haven't found a version that I haven't disliked yet.  This one was no exception.  Henry Winkler did an awesome joy portraying the Scrooge like character.
4 ||| Heard about this movie saw it years ago. Husband wanted to see it, I just added it to my christmas movie collection.
4 ||| Great movie thank you !!!
2 ||| Well made Christmas movie. It's a little slow but sweet natured.
4 ||| Great spin on the Classic Christmas Story by the master C. Dickens...
4 ||| Great product, fast shipping
4 ||| We loved it. Henry Winkler is a great actor and we missed it not being on TV this year, so we had to buy it for our collection.  Thanks
3 ||| This movie is better than it ought to be. Authentic settings and costuming for America 1930's Depression Era. The Scrooge character really does a good changeover. In old TV 4:5 ratio.
4 ||| Good movie
2 ||| OK
3 ||| Love this movie it is a twist from the Original!
4 ||| great adaptation of dickens classic Henry winkler is a gifted actor
4 ||| I have been looking for this dvd for a long time. Love Henry Winkler in the movie
4 ||| There are MANY versions of "A Christmas Carol" out there. In my humble opinion, this feature length story, set in America during the Great Depression, starring Henry Winkler in the "Scrooge" role, is BY FAR the finest interpretation of the classic story. It's as Dickens would have written if he had lived in America in the 1930's. The human drama is REAL, and the joyful ending brings Dickens' ending into the American culture. BIG smile !
4 ||| I've watching this movie for several Christmas seasons and I just love it!
4 ||| this is my all time fav christmas movie.  if you haven't seen this version you need to check it out at least once in your life.
3 ||| Certainly not the best or my favorite but still very enjoyable!
4 ||| Always loved this version of a Christmas Carol.
4 ||| Henry Winkler, cute as ever.  This movie is a nice addition to my Christmas Carol collection.
4 ||| Good movie. Good buy.
3 ||| good
3 ||| Found "An American Christmas Carol" to be enjoyable. In my opinion, it didn't rise to the level of the film versions of the Dickens Christmas Carol, but it was worth watching.
4 ||| Fantastic movie
3 ||| Henry Winkler was great in this.
2 ||| Is among my favorite updated versions of A Christmas Carol.
4 ||| I've always loved watching "American Christmas Carol". Tradition in our family.
4 ||| This movie is really good,I loved it
2 ||| It was OK but not the best.
4 ||| Wonderful movie. Well made and Henry Winkler was amazing in this roll.
3 ||| My husband and I were looking for a Christmas movie to watch and stumbled across this one randomly. We chose it because of Henry Winkler. We were both pleasanly surprised at how much we liked it. It was a nice update on the classic story, even though it's "old" now. We both recommend it.
4 ||| Great
1 ||| Hate to say it, but this is an example of a re-make falling short of the mark.
3 ||| A great contemporary perspective of A Christmas Carol!
4 ||| Great price, great quality, will buy from seller again
4 ||| I was thrilled to see, "An American Christmas Carol", on the Prime list.  I love the Dicken's story and this was a worthy adaptation that I remembered from my original viewing more than 30 years ago.  Set in early 20th century America, there are a few simple changes from the classic version.  Scrooge is a money lender, having grown rich by lending, then repossessing merchandise when his clients could not keep up on payments. The ghosts of Christmas past, present and future are represented by some of the clients.  But, anyone familiar with "The Christmas Carol", will have no trouble recognizing the storyline. Feel good, holiday favorite.
3 ||| Thought it was a very good interpretation of A Christmas Carol. Henry Winkler did a good job as Mr. Slate (Scrooge). I would recommend this movie if you are a fan.
0 ||| did not like
2 ||| It was an ok adaptation, but I still prefer the original version.
4 ||| I was getting tired of the same holiday movies that run every day at christmas.  I love this old movie.  Great to watch during the holidays!!  Me & my husband watched it on Christmas Eve.
2 ||| Not what I expected.  Very low budget.
4 ||| Great movie
4 ||| Very well done!  Henry Winkler performed flawlessly!
4 ||| Very good. The best thing Henry Winkler EVER did.
3 ||| good variation of a theme.
3 ||| A sweet movie with Henry Winkler "The Christmas Carol" genre.
4 ||| This is a classic scrooge movie but set in the 30's and I love Henry Winkler!
4 ||| Excellent inspiring movie!!!
3 ||| Enjoyed this different twist to Dicken's tale.
2 ||| Interesting adaption of the scrooge story.
4 ||| Good take off on the original.
3 ||| Liked
4 ||| always was a good movie
4 ||| I am a Henery Winkler fan
1 ||| Pathetic reproduction of the Dickens classic. Interesting that the movie is particularly concerned with  the problem of people who lose their possessions to money lenders--corporations not unlike the ones which own directly or indirectly the media which present us with the American version of the Christmas carol.
4 ||| I love this movie. Brings back memories to when I first saw it. Henry Winkler is wonderful as an American "Scrooge". It is set during the Depression of the 1930s. And "tiny Tim" is a young boy who has been hit with polio.
2 ||| Fleur bleu.
3 ||| Worth watching if you like dickens
4 ||| Since I love Henry Winkler this is an easy one to enjoy. Henry is such a great actor.
2 ||| It's okay
0 ||| Slow moving. Boring.  Never finished it.
3 ||| I thought it was a good Christmas movie.
3 ||| Just really great! I never knew the Fonze played Scrooge. Well, the characters' names are all different, there's no nephew, the ghost of Christmas future talks, but the basic story line is the same old wonderful classic. I really enjoyed this movie and I think you will too!
4 ||| It was great seeing this again. I remember when it first came out. Henry Winkler was still the Fonz. I remember how strange it was seeing him in this role. A great take on Mr. Dickens classic story.
3 ||| This is your classic Christmas Carol with Henry Winkler playing Scrooge. He was actually fairly young when he played this part. They did a great job making him look like an old man. Of course, Henry did a great job with the acting portion. The ending in this take was a little unbelievable as Scroodge was very old by that time. Still a very uplifting film with a good lesson for life.
3 ||| Fine acting by Henry Winkler and supporting cast.  Nice version of the many films that have been made of A Christmas Carol.
2 ||| Slowwwwwwww
2 ||| Wife liked it!  Old TV Special!
4 ||| Very good movie
4 ||| For fans of the Dickens story this remains fresh today! For fans of Henry Winkler it delivers with his Fonzi good looks and particular method of acting - very focused and sharp with movement and dialogue. Great watch for the Happy Days familiar.
4 ||| well made, good acting for all
3 ||| enjoyed another version of "The Christmas Carol", story still comes through
3 ||| Good remake of the classic
4 ||| I can recall watching Henry Winkler on a talk show when this movie came out on television.  He asked the viewers to let him know what we thought of him in this role as it was different from the ones most had come to know him (eg.  "The Fonz").  When I watched it over 30 years ago, I enjoyed it.  It wasn't until recently I sought it out and watched it again.  It is an excellent retelling of the Dicken's classic with an Americanized twist.  The lessons are timeless and Henry Winkler's Mr Slade is really well done and believable.  If you are fan of a Christmas Carol and have seen many of the cinematic variations and made for TV, this is one you really have to see.
4 ||| While Winkler's make up job is dated and not realistic this version is well done . A nice story . So glad we found it on Amazon after seeing it back on 1979 on TV
1 ||| Such phoney acting!
4 ||| Excellent story that reminds you - to love yourself and other as God/Jesus loves you.
3 ||| Good story for the family, and a great message.
4 ||| Love Henry Winkler! He's a convincing "Scrooge" with a meltable heart. Really liked the way the story wrote in the not-so-ghostly "ghosts" of past, present and future Christmases. And we just love a happy ending, don't we?
3 ||| it was a good movie but we still like the old one best.
4 ||| I saw this as TV movie. It is very good story based on A Christmas Carol set in Depression era. Henry Winkler does excellent Acting. Wonderful Christmas movie.
3 ||| Good as it gets for a modern twist to this 1800's tale.
4 ||| great show
2 ||| it was alright
4 ||| Good movie.
4 ||| Henry Winkler does a great job playing Slade.  He is just plan mean and cold hearted.  Rich with nothing to show for it.  Then the usual transformation.  The auction was a new twist adding humor in an un-expected scene.  Winkler ends up being so much fun at the end of the movie making turning it into a comedy.  I'll watch this again.
4 ||| good movie
3 ||| Henry Winkler did a great job in this American rendition of a classic.
4 ||| This Is a Great Holiday Movie,,, Outstanding,,,, Not To Be Miss'ed
2 ||| ok
4 ||| still love to watch this movie each Christmas season.
4 ||| Good movie
4 ||| Wow. Didnt think I'd like this as much as I do! You never think "The Fonz" when watching this version of the classic story.  Three quarters through this movie I hated Winklers character!! What a creep! Excellent movie IMO.
4 ||| I didn't like it when it first came out. But I guess it grows on you.
2 ||| No offense to the performers, because they were good. This just works best with the setting in England.
4 ||| good movie!
0 ||| Did not like at all
0 ||| This movie was not what I expected, however, it's worth a look (if it's free on Prime). It just wasn't for me man.
3 ||| It was difference and good.
4 ||| There's only one version of A Christmas Carol that I don't like and I won't mention it here. As someone who collects movies of A Christmas Carol, and reads the book almost every year, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the portrayal of Scrooge by Henry Winkler. Set in the depression, this American version works very well for the story.
4 ||| I saw this movie decades ago and tracked it down because it tells the entire story of Ebeneezer Scrooge. Felt sorry for him throughout and celebrated hi salvation at the end.
4 ||| I watched this on Amazon Prime and immediately bought a copy for my library.  A great modern retelling of Dicken's classic, with Winkler as the lead character--WELL acted.  Loved it!!!  The ending was extra nice; I wasn't expecting it.
4 ||| A great take on Dickens's classic with a twentieth century twist. It shows the range of Henry Winkler's acting ability.
4 ||| Great
4 ||| Loved it.
3 ||| The Fonz, who knew... this was a good take on the classic... not a waste of time... You probably know how the story is going to come out, but it is an enjoyable trip, none-the-less...
4 ||| I do not understand why this is not shown more than it is a Christmas time.  It is a semi-modern update on the Charles Dickens classic, A Christmas Carol.  Set in the during the depression the story line familiar and the characters refreshed.
4 ||| A version of Christmas Carol.  It's a good story based on the familiar theme with Henry Winkler as the Scrooge character. Some very talented actors were cast and the acting was very good.  If you like Christmas movies you should definitly give this one a try.
2 ||| A tad hooky but okay.
1 ||| It was merely okay.
4 ||| Thus is a clever way to tell the traditional story. We watch this every Christmas.
3 ||| I had remembered watching this when I was younger and enjoyed it. So I wanted to get and have to watch all the time. My husband and I did enjoy it.
1 ||| Terrible
4 ||| Henry Winkler is a better actor than he gets credit for.  He makes a credible American version of Scrooge.
4 ||| Favorite Christmas movie
3 ||| great for christmas movie
4 ||| Good movie and came on time. Thanks.
4 ||| Terrific Christmas movie. A new twist to A Christmas Carol
4 ||| Great movie
4 ||| Love it!
4 ||| My sweetie and I swap movies.  Her folks slept through the 80's and mine hated classic movies. She really loved this one of mine and it was even better than I remembered. Clarity was superb and Henry Winkler's interview was great!
3 ||| 4 Stars
4 ||| Great remake!  I would like to add this to my own collection of movies.
4 ||| In this Americanized version of The Charles Dickens classic..which takes place in Concord New Hampshire on Christmas eve,1933.."Ben Slade"(played by Henry Winkler)is an insensitive and greedy time payment holder..who forces the citizens of the small New England village to either pay up their loans or lose all of their items. When they can't pay up..they lose all of their assets and he even fires his assistant"Thatcher"for trying to get his boss to reopen the failed  mill to create new industry and jobs for the unemployed workers. But "Slade"soon learns the folly of his ways from the ghost of his late partner"Jack Latham"..who tells him that his cruel nature will be the ruin of him and to prevent his soul from being dammed..he must expects the visits of three more ghosts..that night.."Slade"does receive those visitations..and thru the retelling of his past and seeing tragedy of a lonely and sad death..he learns his lesson and although he doesn't became a happier soul like"Scrooge"..He does learn to deal with people in a better way..This film is a wonderful retelling of the Yultide tale and Mr. Winkler gives his best performance ever.
4 ||| From all the Christmas Carol's I watched based on dickens book I liked this the best.  As a boy I watched this on TV and this was not long after Henry Winkler ended his career as the Fonz.  Personally i think he should have made a bigger career as an actor but i assume he may have been type casted and thus shortened his acting future.
4 ||| Great version of A Christmas Carol - we love it. The seller was fantastic - shipping faster than indicated and the price was amazing! Another great addition to our Christmas movie collection.
3 ||| I'm only docking this version of the Dickens classic one star because Henry Winkler will always be "the Fonz" to me, and I still hear the voice of "the Fonz" when Winkler delivers his lines as Mr. Slade, an American version of Scrooge from the Herbert Hoover era.  He plays young and old versions of the character, and sounds, to me, especially out of character as the old/new Mr. Slade.
4 ||| loved it.
3 ||| I love this adaptation of the classic tale.  Henry Winkler is, of course, one of my favorite actors.  This is a different slant from the original but it gets the message across none the less.  Well worth the viewing.
4 ||| I always liked Henry Winkler and he did not disappoint. He played a good mean man.... stayed with the original plot for the most part..
1 ||| It started out promising, but it began to drag on and on focusing on too much irrelevant history.
4 ||| This is a great movie. It's a twist on a classic of scrooge.
1 ||| An unusual take on " A Christmas Carol."  This movie takes place in New Hampshire in the early 20TH century. It is a made for tv movie on a very low budget.  It has some good parts and the acting is not bad, but Henry Winklers' make up is very badly done, when he made this movie he was in his late 40's and he plays an old Scoroge, in this case Slade.in his 80's. Interesting but I would not recommend it.
4 ||| Nice twist to a great classic story
4 ||| I have seen this several times and enjoyed it more each time. Highly recommended!
3 ||| Different than the original but still good
2 ||| Cute, but not as good as original.
4 ||| This is a really good take on the original A Christmas Carol. I liked this version and Henry Winkler does a fine job!!!
4 ||| Great twist on original
4 ||| This is a great alternative to A Christmas Carol/Scrooge.  It is a twist on the original, but still a very enjoyable Christmas movie.  Henry Winkler is great as the lead character.  He plays an elderly miser very well.
4 ||| As advertised. Very nice. An easy and problem free transaction. Thank you.
4 ||| Great Christmas story
4 ||| Great DVD
4 ||| NICE TWIST TO THE ORIGINAL
0 ||| Henry Winkler is a bad actor and has never had much talent.
4 ||| gift. Loved it!
4 ||| Nice
3 ||| This is a different spin on the classic "The Christmas Carol".  It is nice, and you might want to add it to you Christmas collection.
4 ||| Love anything to do with a Christmas carol. Henry Winkler is excellent great telling hard to find excellent condition. Really enjoy it!  A little different telling but same result.
4 ||| Great classic XMas movie
4 ||| Oldie, but a goodie
4 ||| Great movie
2 ||| GOOD, BUT NOT THE ALL TIME CLASSIC
2 ||| My boyfriend had fond memories of this from his childhood so we rented it. Meh...it wasn't bad but given the number of versions of A Christmas Carol that are out there, this ranks pretty low. Henry Winkler gave a wobbly and not very believable version of an American Scrooge, rather like a high school boy playing an old man, and the conversion of the story from England to America felt sort of forced. It just seemed very dated to me.  I can't see it ever becoming a "classic" version of this story, but if your curious to see The Fonz in a very different role, here it is.
4 ||| A very good American rendition of the Christmas Carol story.  The entire cast presents a great family movie to view during the holiday season.  This is a keeper!
4 ||| Well-cast, wonderfully told version of "A Christmas Carol".  I watch this at least 10 times each Christmas season.
4 ||| I enjoyed this movie very much.
1 ||| BORING !!
3 ||| This item was exactly what I was hoping for. However, there was one glitch in the recording.
4 ||| Good working order
4 ||| Great movie
4 ||| watched it for Christmas thought it was excellent glad I bought it.
4 ||| Excellent
4 ||| i like it a lot
4 ||| I love just about any movie that has to do with The Christmas Carol. I can now add this one to the list.
3 ||| Good movie but not my favorite.
3 ||| I love this version of the christmas carol...
4 ||| Great
4 ||| an excellent christmas movie. quite a delight.
0 ||| Terrible version of this movie, poor acting! And I love Henry winkler ! I donated this movie
4 ||| An updated superior version of a classic which has to be THE most underrated christmas classic.  Winkler, as another reviewer posted, really demonstrates his incredible acting ability.
4 ||| Great American Version of Charles Dickens "A Christmas Carol". Excellent ensemble acting!  A must to watch every holiday season!
4 ||| great version of the traditional story!
4 ||| This is a very good movie. Henry Winker is excellent.  It is touching and will warm your heart for Christmas.
4 ||| Classic
4 ||| A must to own for you Christmas collection.  Henry Winkler is amazing in this uptake of Scrooge.
4 ||| A great acting job of Henry Winker. Good take on The Christmas Carol with an American view.
4 ||| well well well, lots of talent here
4 ||| A great remake of Charles Dickens' - "A Christmas Carol"! Additional Fact: I wish the lines of.the novie were sub-titled! 63x927is58401
4 ||| One of the better remakes of A Christmas Carol, plus Henry Winkler does the part justice.  He is very believable in this roll.
4 ||| Amazing. Gives a whole new view.
4 ||| i am very happy with this dvd
4 ||| good copy
4 ||| great story
4 ||| Great
3 ||| I remember watching this as a kid on prime time television.  I love this unique version of a Christmas Carol.
4 ||| Best performance ever
4 ||| I have always loved this version of A Christmas Carol, but the quality was always poor.  If you can get this on blu-ray, I recommend that.  This is a great movie, though.
4 ||| I enjoyed this movie because it was much easier to relate to than the original English classic version.  I had watched parts of it on TV many years ago.
4 ||| Henry Winkler is a fine actor and this version of the famous story is proof positive. He does and excellent job as Ebeneezer Scrooge. The story, of course, is the same as the other versions, but each remake brings a different interpretation by the actors and writers. This one is fun and easy to watch. A fine family film.
4 ||| This was one of my favorite holiday movies as a kid.  Although it is tailored after Charles Dickens Christmas Carol, this movie has some distinct differences which actually make it stand on its own merit.  I love the regular story of Christmas Carol, but this is refreshingly different and a must see.
4 ||| An American Christmas Carol...based on the classic by Charles Dickens, "A Christmas Carol." Now that I've written something, you need to cut down the word number requirement. That's really stupid.
4 ||| Henry Winkler plays a great part in this movie, brings it to life! Good modern version of Scrooge! Don't miss this classic
4 ||| This is my favorite Christmas Carol movie. I have waited for it to come out, and when I finally looked it up again, I bought it!
3 ||| It is pretty much the traditional Scrooge story, but set in America in about 1880.  It does give a twist to it to help Americans tie the story into a scene in their history.
4 ||| This timeless story is relevant to today's economic times. This movie is as valuable as any modern-day teachings I've read within the context of "how to be a better person, live well, and do it right in the new year". There are old fashion morals that America would do well in revisiting. Kids and young adults alike will find a new perspective on everyday life challenges. Everyone will gain a better attitude after viewing this one. Anyone who purchases this movie will not be disappointed. Henry Winkler; who doesn't enjoy his workmanship?
4 ||| I thought his was a great twist on A Christmas Carol that put it in a more relevant perspective for these times
1 ||| Another entry in the retelling of the classic.  Ho hum from start to finish.  Henry Winkler is not believable as a Scrooge type.
3 ||| Nice drama- based on the original Christmas Carol movie.  This version stars Henry Winkler as Scrooge and takes place during the Depression in America.  Winkler plays Scrooge as a business owner who offers home furnishings to be paid off over time.  But most people can,t pay off the entire bill due to job scarcity - etc- and Winkler ends up repossessing much of what he has "sold".  Soon "ghosts"- ( passed aquaintances in this version)- of Chistmas past, present, and future appear taking Winkler back through time and into the future showing him his past and what the future holds in store for one of his "value system" ,  Winkler realizes that he best become more kinder and more considerate of the needs of his town neighbors or risk dying a lonely and embittered man.  Dramatic with poignant scenes.  Held my attention throughout!
4 ||| It has been years since I first saw this version of a Christmas Carol. I had remarked to my daughter that I would like to see the Christmas Carol version with Henry Winkler one day when we were discussing all the different versions. I was glad I was able to watch and enjoy it again.
3 ||| Winkler does a little over-the-top in his role as the scrooge character and the production values leave somewhat more to be desired but all-in-all a nice rendition for holiday viewing.
3 ||| I liked Mr Winklers pertrayal of a depression error Ebineser. He played the part of promising, driven young man, to unmoraled business man, to kind hearted senior citizen quite well. It was not a big Holywood production. But for a made for TV Movie it was quite good.
4 ||| I love An American Christmas Carol with Henry Winkler.  In my opinion it is the very best version of Scrooge.  Hope everyone sees it and enjoys it as much as I do.
4 ||| Great American Versions of the Dickens's Classic. Enjoyed it very much This video is worth buying. It has a modern view of a "Christmas Carol".
3 ||| An updated version of A Christmas Carol that doesn't lose any of the important stuff. Great movie for the family.
3 ||| Trying to make Dickens relevant again, this dresses him up in American hard times and values. Winkler is always a pleasure to watch. I don't know, however, how Winkler would have Dickens speak if set in post-2007 American, though.
4 ||| I thought the movie was great when it came out in 1979 and still think it's great today. This is a good movie for the whole family to watch; however, not sure if the kids of today would appreciate it.
4 ||| I got this for a person who has it on vhs and needed it replaced. They wanted to keep it in there collection. Thank you for the promptness of receiving it.
2 ||| It didn't grab our attention enough to finish it.  It was probably okay if it was the first Christmas movie you watched this season.
2 ||| Don't get me wrong, Winkler is a wonderful character actor and I would rate 95% of his performances as B+ or A, however, he was not very convincing in the starring role of "An American Christmas Carol."  I'd give it a C or C+ at best.  Ayyyyy!
4 ||| I collect all the (non-musical) versions of this story. This one is not seen often on TV. I watch it every Christmas. Good updated (1930's) version of the Dickens classic. TRY IT!! DVD has played well with no problems.
4 ||| It seems like just about everybody has made a Christmas Carol movie.  This one is the best by far!  It seems more realistic than all the others and the time period seems to be perfect.  The acting is also far better than any of the others I've seen; my opinion.
3 ||| I liked this production giving the possible American point of view.  We've all seen the original Christmas Carol but I'd highly recommend this to anyone.  We watched this with our grandchildren whose interest was kept the entire length.
3 ||| This was an interesting take on the old "Christmas Carol" movies inspired by Dickens novel.  My husband loved it.  It is about people in the  depression era and it was interesting to see the scenery, clothes and furniture, etc.  The acting was very good, too.
4 ||| Ignore some of the more negative reviews on here. This made for TV movie really touches me every time I watch it; which is every Christmas.  The acting is splendid and the story is well written. It is suitable for the entire family and it gives a good picture of the depression era of our country.
3 ||| This was a movie from my youth that I would watch every year. I just love it. I am a Charles Dicken fan.
4 ||| This is hardly ever on TV and thankfully found on Prime. This movie captures the 30's as well as Dickens' Christmas Carol
4 ||| All I can say is watch it and judge for yourselves.  I used to live in Concord, and it is not truly historically accurate. though there does appear to be a genuine Concord Coach in Slade's barn and there is indeed still a granite  quarry.
3 ||| This is one of the best Scrooge movies out.  Henry Winkler outdoes himself.  The casting is excellent and the music and theme old but very relevant.
4 ||| The first time I saw "An American Christmas Carol" I immediately fell in love with it.  I didn't grow up during the Great Depression but my father did and he told stories that made it real for me.  This re-imagination of an Americanized Scrooge during the Depression is wonderful.  The story, acting, directing, camera work, costumes, sets, locations, music, and all production values are great.  I have always enjoyed Henry Winkler as an actor, but I think this is by far one of his best if not the best performance of his career to date.  I highly recommend it for the whole family.  CA Luster
2 ||| It was pretty good. It takes the classic Christmas carol set originally in London and brings it to America.  Henry Winkler does a good Scrooge character
4 ||| The small historic Canadian town of Elora, with its many century-old buildings, is the perfect setting for this story, set in the early 1900's.  Bringing the story to 20th century America allows the story to incorporate situations Americans can more easily with.  Henry Winkler does a great job of recreating the Scrooge character, and the supporting cast are no less admirable.  This is an annual "must watch" story for me.
3 ||| Set in the USA about the time of the depression it is an update of that old familiar story of redemption.  The story is classic and this one is as good as all the rest.  Henry Winkler is good in this role.
4 ||| This is one of my fav versions....set during the Depression in America. It's unique regarding Scrooge's upbringing in an orphanage (when he repossess the orphanage's piano on  Christmas Eve!)
3 ||| Very well done, Henry Winkler is a smooth guy. Close to the original story line, so is fun to watch from an American perspective.
3 ||| Good remake of Christmas Carol with relatively few twists.  Set during the great depression in the U.S. Henry Winkler is generally good, but gives a few too many Fonzi looks for me.
4 ||| I saw this for the first time in the 80s and liked the "American" twist on the Charles Dickens' classic. I love this story in all versions, as the first version for me was Mr. Magoo!!
4 ||| This is Charles Dickens' classic Christmas Carol with an American twist.  This version does a nice job of capturing the consequences of history and one's personal role in it.  It provides a sobering view of the main character's choices, just as the original, "A Christmas Carol," did but this version also shows how one man's choices affect those around him.  I recommend this film to anyone who collects different versions of, "A Christmas Carol."
4 ||| A good Christmas carol dhenry winkler one during the depression. Henry winkler does a good job.a classic film I recommend for all ages.
4 ||| I have searched for this film for years and finally found it here on Amazon. Saw it on television years ago and it was one I knew I wanted.
3 ||| Henry Winkler is the one of the best Scrooge I've seen! We see a lot of Scrooge movies this was a breath of fresh air.
4 ||| A great acting job by Henry Winkler. I saw this many years ago and it'll always be a Christmas favorite.
3 ||| I'm a big fan of Christmas Carol-esk stories so I gave it an extra star for that. Of course, the storyline is cheesy and overworked in these types of movies but I actually enjoyed it. And Henry Winkler was excellent.
2 ||| Worth watching this new version of the classic.  It is a little slow in parts but still entertaining. The real negative issue and distraction throughout is Henry Winkler's make up that is supposed to make him look old.  It just looks like Henry Winkler with make-up that is supposed to make him look old.  Even if you did not know the actor you would know that it was makeup and not an old man.  The wig was very good though--looked very authentic.
3 ||| It was a nice twist on the classic. Henry Winkler is much better actor than most people think of him!
1 ||| This is a first for me, I didn't like this movie and I think I only had it on for about 20 minutes.  Acting just wasn't there.
2 ||| Just  OK, I had a a hard time putting "Fonzie" as a gruff person, and to me it was just OK, glad I watched it but not one of my favorites.
4 ||| This has been a favorite movie of mine for a long time.  Henry winkler is great as a modern day Scrooge.  There are many movies giving a new twist to Dickens, but this one is true to the original story.  It is set during the depression.
3 ||| I 'collect' movie versions of 'A Christmas Carol', This is a very good one. It is true to the spirit of the book while putting an American spin on it. If you really like Dicken's story you will probably enjoy this version.
4 ||| How a bitter old man comes to know the true meaning of Christmas. Realizing to late his lost love and life.
4 ||| I watched this when it came out on tv way back when, and I have looked for it ever since. I was so shocked when I saw it on here and I just had to have it. WATCH THIS, IT IS GREAT!!
4 ||| Every few Christmas seasons I watch this with my Mom.  The film makes us feel so good....it is well acted and never fails to leave a good feeling inside.
3 ||| this movie stars henry winkler. an enjoyable christmas tale. he was superb in this role. a twist on the old "scrooge".
4 ||| I almost began with "what can I say". Well, thinking about it I can say much about this Christmas tale. It is a great twist on a classic holiday movie. Henry Winkler is well know for his role as the "Fonz". He owned this movie through his portrayal of a miserable miser. His gradual aging from youth to old age was quite amazing. Oh Henry, you prove over and over what a quality actor can do for stage and screen.
4 ||| Among the best of this beloved Christmas story; We enjoy Henry Winkler's twist on Scrooge and the story-line. He makes for a very believable Scrooge, both pre and post "redemption"!
4 ||| I have always loved this rendition of A Christmas Carol with it's american twist.  I had it on VHS but finally gave up my player for a DVD player. Previously only bootlegged copies were available.  I was very happy to find it recently produced on DVD/Bluray. It is a great Holiday movie.
4 ||| I had forgotten about this movie til I saw it on Amazon. Loved it when it came out and still do. The Fonz is really cool in this modern holiday classic.
4 ||| This is a timeless classic which shows that those people from the Depression era experienced a lot of what might have taken place in England during the time of Dickens.
4 ||| He did a great job as a Scrooge type character. I truly enjoyed this film. I liked him from the Happy Days show.
4 ||| This is one of my favorites... I was very happy to see it on this site. Henry Winkler  played this part well.
4 ||| We (my daughter and I) have collected just about every one of the DVD "Christmas Carols"... This was always a favorite of mine and We finally got a copy... It was great to watch it again..
4 ||| Henry Winkler does an excellent job as the stingy Mr Slade.  The counterpart to Ebeneezer Scrooge in this adaptation of the classic story.  It was wonderfully done.
4 ||| Henry Winkler is one of my favorite actors of all time.  He is wonderful in An American Christmas Carol!  This is another movie that has not been shown at Christmas in the last few years, but should be.  So glad that I could get it for my collection of favorite Christmas movies.
4 ||| I have always enjoyed this movie.  I had it on DVD but wanted it on Blue Ray and the quality is excellent.  I have no complaints and am very pleased to buy from Amazon.
3 ||| "An American Christmas Carol "is different in some ways from the original " A Christmas Carol ". At least the characters names are changed in this movie. I have seen many versions of this story and have enjoyed all of them. This is not my most favorite version of all,but it is maybe my fourth favorite. I like the original story better, that is why I gave it 4 stars. It does do a good job of telling the story of Scrooge, even with the name changes. It is the same general idea. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the original story.
3 ||| As we were picking Christmas movies this year, I remembered seeing one with Henry Winkler.  Took me a while to find it because I didn't recall the title correctly.  Told my wife she would really like it.  Was not disappointed.  A very good Christmas classic in my book.  Winkler is terrific in this role.
4 ||| A Family Classic and Henry Winkler makes it great. I would make a great gift for any of your family or friends.
4 ||| As usual, Henry Winkler gave a superb performance, (Way to go Fonzie). Owning quite a few movies and cartoons on the Christmas Carol, I must say that this version has a somewhat modern, 20th century, yet fitting theme. I loved it. Highly recommended!
4 ||| Although my husband prefers the original Christmas carol, he does like this as well.  I love it. Henry Winkler is very good in this movie. A nice change from the original Christmas carol movies.
4 ||| A wonderful story about the Christmas Spirit & how it changed the life of a very lonely, old miser.  A true witness that it is ''NEVER TOO LATE''  to open up you heart & life to others.
4 ||| Henry Winkler played a great part as Scrooge.  It gave yet another twist to all the Christmas Carols of the past.
4 ||| I worked for an ABC station in the 70's and early 80's so I knew and watched when this movie first aired.  I wasn't expecting a great show, just one of those expositions of ABC stars like "Love American Style" was in that error.  I was very surprised and my wife even cried.  This is a well written, well directed and edited movie.  Not corny but as the title denotes, with a script that moves away from the original script.  In this era of NAFTA and trade treaties this message is as timely as it was in the period of the movie.  Also Henry Winkler, who obviously plays the character in several ages, does a great job.
4 ||| Most of us remember Henry Winkler in the role of Arthur "The Fonz" Fonzarelli on Happy Days. I took a chance on this. He's an even better actor than I remember. The story is set during the depression. Henry's character reposesses furniture rented from him by various poor families. Instead of ghosts, he has visions involving the people he's left destitute. Not sappy like some Christmas Carol renditions are. I was favorably impressed by the story as well as the acting. Gerard Parks (Doc from Fraggle Rock) was also in it, as was a young Dorian Harewood. A nice addition to my Christmas Carol collection.
4 ||| This is one of my favorite versions of the Scrooge story but they never show it now I can watch when I want to
3 ||| The title says it all - this is a Christmas carol re-done. Henery Winkler play the part of Scrooge in this American version of the timeless Classic It is well worth the investment if you are a collector of the Christmas carol stories.
3 ||| My family really enjoys this more modern re-telling of Dickens' "A Christmas Carol." You have all of the basic elements set in depression-era America. Henry Winkler is fantastic as both the crotchety old Mr. Slade and the idealistic young Mr. Slade. It should really be part of your holiday movie collection.
4 ||| Glad that this american classic came out on dvd.  I have been waiting for it for a long time.  I haven't seen this production since it came out years ago.  Plus it's better than some Hallmark holiday movies.
4 ||| This is one of the best Christmas stories out there. It was on T.V 15 or 20 years ago, I've been trying to track it down ever since. It's the Christmas Carol - Scrooge story but with a new twist. It takes place in America during the depression.  Received the product in excellent condition, in the expected time. At a good price.
4 ||| Henry Winkler is excellent. The only thing I have to say is, there was too much time spent on his Christmas past. I got bored with it. Otherwise, it was good and worth the money.
3 ||| Not the best quality DVD, but it's a great story. I recommend it to all.
4 ||| This is the American adaptation of the Charles Dickens' classic.  It is interesting that in the movie the main character is seen ripping the pages out of a collector's item book of "A Christmas Carol."  Henry Winkler gives an outstanding performance as Benedict Slade, a loan officer who reclaims valued possessions of those unable to make late payments on Christmas Eve.  His visit by the spirits, the life in the orphanage and how one man helped him, leads to a very sentimental ending.  It would have been good if the images could be enhanced for better viewing.  This originally was a 'made-for-TV' program and is presented complete with the fade-outs for the commercial breaks.  David Wayne gives a great performance as the book owner as well as Christmases past.
4 ||| The Christmas Carol is my all-time favorite movie, and I had ever version imagionable on VHS, including this adaptation, but the remarkably enhanced quality of the DVD version is extremely enjoyable to watch. This rendition gives it an American twist, as Henry Winkler did a wonderful performance of a modern-day Scrooge.
4 ||| 93 Snazzes on the 100 Point Snazz-O-Scale! An excellent and original adaption.  An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression. -An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future. -Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.  "Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone." "Thank God," Slade responds. "It's worse," Latham says.  A short while later Slade says "But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!" "Evil isn't just what you do," Latham replies, "It's also what you DON'T do."  A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him. -As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged. -Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet. -The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. "Did you read that book, Mister Slade?" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed. "The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?" "Humbug?"
4 ||| This is an excellent remake of the Dickins' A Christmas Carol.  It should be placed along side your existing Christmas collection!
4 ||| Henry Winkler is very good in this twist on the classic story. Not a conventional remake, but a version of the story set in early America. Give it a try.
3 ||| A brilliant adaptation of Dickson's classic set in early 20th century New England.  Well written and well acted, Henry Winkler shines as a young entrepreneur who is more interested in wealth and progress than romance and family, until...  I don't want to give it away.  Trust me. You'll love it.
3 ||| Fun DVD and I always like the Christmas Carol, this is not quite up as high as others but I still watch it every year.
4 ||| A friend put me on to this a few years back when he asked me to find it for him on DVD.  A Christmas Carol is a yearly read for me (at least once) and the Patrick Stewart version, being well-casted and closest to the book text, is also a yearly event, for me.  I also like the George C. Scott version, however, with reservations as other reviews mentioned - the annoying changes on some of the key points of the story.  That is to give you an idea where I am coming from with this version.  The title describes what you're getting - the Christmas Carol story with an American flavor.  Henry Winkler is excellent and, considering the time in which this was made, the production value is fairly good!!  Dorian Harewood is my favorite of the three "ghosts" who visit him and (SPOILER ALERT) I like the twist of having the visiting ghosts be the same people he was mistreating.  Depression-era America doesn't have nearly the "romantic" quality that Victorian England does, but it works well with the story.  Overall, a worthy addition to your collection of Christmas Carol movies.  Also, kudos to Image entertainment for re-releasing this at a reasonable price and getting rid of the dreaded snap-case.
2 ||| My wife told me of this movie in which Henry Winkler stars & shows he can act in this different version of a Chrismas Carol.
3 ||| This movie was made in 1979, when Henry Winkler was in his heyday of playing "The Fonz" on "Happy Days".  It was exciting back then to see what else he could do, and he came through admirably.  This movie hasn't played on TV in at least a decade that I remember, and it should be, for it's a fresh take on the old Dickens tale.  The setting is Concord, NH in 1933, and miserly Benedict Slade goes about repossessing people's furniture, stoves, radios - and even a piano from a children's orphanage! - on Christmas Eve.  Then come the visitations and, well, we know the rest of the story.  Pick it up for a treat for next Christmas.
3 ||| I loved this film when it was on tv when I was in High School; seeing it on DVD was an enjoyable experience, but I found an annoying problem in continuity: Winkler's character seems to be growing up in the 1890s, which is fine, but at one point we see him at a WWI War Bond Rally, and he seems to be in his early-thirties.  Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.  I have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.  Oh well, great movie.
4 ||| This is a wonderful movie. It stay faithful to A Christmas Carol, but it very American. A fun movie for one and all.
4 ||| One of the best "Scrooge" movies, a very creative adaptation.
4 ||| I am happy I got to see this and it plays on my UK DVD player.  Mr Slade is as nasty as all the other Scrooges and you can tell who the characters are, Slade is Mr Scrooge and Thatcher is meant to be Bob Cratchet.  I am happy that I got to see this DVD because that is the only Christmas Carol DVD that I have not seen.
4 ||| If you want the classic version, go with the George C. Scott or Patrick Stewart version. If you want the best family version, go with the Muppet Christmas Carol, which stars Michael Caine and is suprisingly good. But if you want to hear the same old story told in a new, effective setting, get this movie.  As a depression-era American miser whose experiences parallel Scrooge's, Henry Winkler gives a convincing (and at times heart-wrenching) performance. The supporting cast, including Dorian Harewood, also turn in exceptional performances. Nothing in this movie is tacky, anachronistic, overacted, or otherwise out of place - it is as well-crafted a Christmas movie as you can find. And if it leaves you completely untouched, let's just say that you may need some nocturnal visitors to give you Christmas spirit a special "jump start" this year.  In short, this movie deserves your family's full attention in the coming Christmas season.  I'm glad it's out on DVD, as we've worn out two videotapes of the show.

2 ||| Mr. Winkler failed to capture my attention in this ignoble version of the classic Dickens fable. However, it isn't without a certain charm all its own. And to Henry's credit, and partly to my own blame, I have never been able to seperate Henry Winkler from the Fonz of Happy Days. I can't say that I disliked the movie it just doesn't rate up there with the Christmas classics in my estimation and this is simply my own personal take on the film.  If you're looking for a Christmas movie that the whole family can enjoy together on occasion then this DVD will fit right in, but if you're looking to gather movies for your library that are the so called "must have Christmas movies" then pass it up for another title.
4 ||| My wife and I grew up in New Hampshire where this version takes place; so we can easily relate to the characters and setting.  Asside from this, we both really like this version because it places the story in a more comfortable setting in general; early America versus England.  Both spins are great, this just adds to an already powerful Christmas message.
2 ||| For some reason I always thought this film was older than 1979...in any case this "American-ized" version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol stars Henry Winkler as the SCrooge character who is renamed Benedict Slade.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity when this ABC made for TV movie came out so I'm certain that's why he was cast.  Unfortunately you just can't see anything but Fonzie, even under layers and layers of make-up.  The scene is shifted from 1840's London to  Depression-era New England, as miserly businessman Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans. Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.  In a bit of ridiculousness, the "Ghost of Christmas Future" is portrayed by a black man wearing gold chains, dressed in 1979 fashions and listens to disco music. Their "Ghost of the Future" jumped a little too far ahead, and is comical by todays standards.  Winkler does an admirable job in his role and Dorian Harewood really shines.  Still...Dickens is a classic...why ABC felt a need to revise something so perfect is beyond me.  This is a good change of pace but if you really like "A CHristmas Carol" stick with the Alastair Sim or George C. Scott versions.
4 ||| Henry Winkler stars in this remake of the classic tale of Scrooge.  This one is set in post-Depression era America and is oneof the best I've ever seen.  Winkler is equally at ease as a young man with a girlfriend or an old man with an attitude.  I watch this every Christmas and was delighted to discover it on DVD.  You'll love it!
4 ||| TNT has put together a surprisingly good account of the Biblical story of  Joseph, betrayed into slavery in Egypt by his jealous brothers.  Martin  Landau as Jacob and Ben Kingsley as Potiphar give their usual first-rate  performances, with the role of Joseph also well-acted.  Leslie-Anne Warren is  the lustful wife of Potiphar, who unsuccessfully tries to seduce Joseph,  and lands him in the Pharoah's prison.  This film offers a very credible  depiction of life in the ancient Near East, from the desert tents of the  Hebrews, to the claustrophobic walled towns like Sichem, to the lushness of  civilized Egypt and the Pharoah's court. The film is faithful to the  Biblical account, and succeeds in making it come alive on the screen.  A  well-acted, well-scripted, and entertaining film.  END
4 ||| a must see
4 ||| very good
4 ||| Received intact and as expected
3 ||| I was satisfied.
4 ||| perfect
0 ||| Many changes / additions!
4 ||| Love it!!!
4 ||| Love these movies priceless
4 ||| WELL WRITTEN AND PORTRAYED EVERYONE SHOULD SEE IT
4 ||| Love Bible stories on disc.
4 ||| Great quality. Very good movie.
4 ||| The movie is well made and does the Bible story justice.  A true historical and inspiring story.
4 ||| I really liked this version of Joseph in the Bible Collection. I bought the one in Bible Stories and it was ok but the movie is more down to earth to the events and follows scripture better.
4 ||| Amazing movie that perfectly tells the Bible story of Joseph, the actors couldn't be more perfect, it tells the story exactly the way I pictured it!
4 ||| Good quality. Micheal
4 ||| Excellent format and an engaging adaptation of the life of Joseph. I thoroughly enjoyed it the first time and have played it for my own entertainment many times since then.
4 ||| very good movie , you will love it to .
4 ||| A good family movie, very enjoyable, and story was interesting and followed Bible Verses as close as modern day acting would allow.
4 ||| True to biblical narrative.
4 ||| good movie
4 ||| Very much
2 ||| it's okay
1 ||| If you gave this a high rating. It was for being a great HOLLYWOOD Production.. If you read the BIBLE you will find out Joseph was quite the opposite. It's in a small part a Christian movie. I can't see God pleased with exploiting sex scenes. If the Hollywood director when by the bible it would have raved reviews. It goes to show you how many BIBLE read the bible and how many never have opened one, going by all this Five star ratings.
4 ||| Very good movie
4 ||| Love this DVD.  I can't seem to get it back from people I've loaned it to as they love it too!
4 ||| Love this movie like to watch it and learn from it.
4 ||| Loved it.
4 ||| EXCELLENT!
4 ||| I first saw this movie on TBN.  I loved the movie and had been unable to find it anywhere.  Went looking on Amazon, and surprise. I found it.  I purchased it, and I have never looked back.  Very Good!
4 ||| All I can say it's great, especially if you own this Bible collection. Have a blessed year, God Bless
4 ||| Great
4 ||| This is a very favorite movie.  I truly enjoy watching this movie over and over and over again.
4 ||| Great movie
4 ||| This was a made for TV movie, that I watched when it was aired.  I love this story from the Bible.  It is so interesting and has such a good message for all of us.  This is the best production of this story that I've ever seen.  It is very thorough and emotional. A must see for everyone.
4 ||| I just watched this movie and follows the Torah very closely.  the acting and sets were really great to look at.
3 ||| The price tripled from two weeks ago. It is a good movie, good actors, and acting,  and pretty true to the bible story of Joseph and his brothers. But  it is not right that they increase the price so much. So I will wait until it goes back down to get another one.
4 ||| Excellent Movie!
4 ||| Like Joseph, many lives are lived from one tragedy to the next as learning, reshaping, the and the molding process of God takes place. But when it's time for these servants to come forth into the lives they have been trained for, they do shine with God's favor and glory on them, indeed!
4 ||| One of the best bible movies, that stayed close to the authenticity of the bible.
4 ||| Great Bible story I had to see agaig.
4 ||| EXCELLENT MOVIE
4 ||| Happy that it was the best version of this story...
4 ||| Very close to the story of Genesis.  If you ever wondered how the Israelites ended up in bondage, this gives you the history.
1 ||| I Didn't like this movie. I will keep and add it to my collection..This movie hit a soft spot with me it's about jealousy something a lot of people have had against me my whole life even family members. This movie was really sad I cried at the end because I couldn't hold myself any longer, and I'm a very strong woman..Joseph brothers sold him into slavery because their father favored him. Joseph had several brothers who sinned in the eyes of GOD, so their father favored Joseph because he was the youngest and most righteous. That enraged his brothers they trapped young Joseph and was going to leave him for dead then Egyptians came along the brothers decided to sell him into slavery instead....I didn't see any nudity in the movie. I decided to write that because I read some reviews that talked about nudity I didn't see no nudity in Joseph.......I purchased 3 movies.......David..........Abraham & Joseph....I rate #1David.....#2 Abraham..#3 Joseph..I liked David the most...
0 ||| Even tho it states bible collection it might as well have been sold in the back of a xxx video shop, the women wear see through clothes, and they might have worn these in period but they could have worn under ware under them, I would not recommend this video to anyone.....
4 ||| Love this movie and so does my husband. It never gets old!
4 ||| love it
4 ||| I have watched this film so many times that I cannot count.  Joseph provides a thoughtful look at a man of God who goes through betrayal, slavery, slander, imprisonment.  In the end, his faithfulness to God and his forgiving spirit are rewarded when I becomes the second most powerful man in ancient Egypt.
4 ||| Excellent
4 ||| I simply LOVE this story. Is so beautifully done. They must of spent a fortune with the sets and costumes. In my opinion even better than the settings used in Cleopatra (with Elizabeth Taylor) Very good acting as well. Worth buying and the message is tremendous.
3 ||| Really good movie
4 ||| First watched this as a teenager in youth group at church.  Was happy to find the 2-cassette VHS version a few years ago.  Am now happy to have it on DVD for continued enjoyment.  This tells the story of the Biblical character Joseph, from his days as a young shepherd, to being sold by his brothers into slavery in Egypt, to becoming the second-most-powerful man in Egypt and an eventual reunion with his family.  It's a well done production that brings the story to life.
4 ||| One of my favorite biblical stories ever. I love this movie. The quality of the package was beyond safe and arrived right on time
4 ||| great movie
4 ||| A Beautifully written and produced film. And a story that is true today.
4 ||| New movie at a great price. Excellent time and condition.
3 ||| Just something more uplifting to add to my video collection
4 ||| Enjoyed the movie. Closely follows scripture and great for families to view.
4 ||| The story of Joseph was my grandfathers favorite story and his grandchildren heard him recount the details weekly. This "Joseph" DVD is quite long, 3+ hours but worth every minute. My favorite by far of this series on Old Testament characters. You will not be disappointed.
4 ||| Fine performances. Good quality dvd.
4 ||| This movie is so totally, wonderfully, Biblically accurate!  It puts the emotion into the story of Joseph and allows you to literally FEEL what he must have experienced.  Wonderfully done and so very moving.
4 ||| Great movie!!!
3 ||| no comment
4 ||| Stunning. Obviously you should read the Bible first and after, to know what happened and compare, but this is close enough and done very well. Love the music!!!!
4 ||| all good ty
4 ||| Very good Ben Kingsley plays the part of the pharoh excelently. Congrats to keeping wth the biblical content,to many tend to drift apart Biblical, to Holywood.
4 ||| It was very close to the bible , loved it
4 ||| Loved this movie for entertainment and for history's sake
2 ||| Good Video
4 ||| satisfied
3 ||| Watched at least a dozen times and never lacked a good version of the bible story line of the true Joseph and his love for God.
4 ||| One of my favorite movies. They did an excellent job of staying true to the story. As you watch this movie you are reminded of the faith AND patience of Joseph. If anyone in history had a reason to throw his hands up and declare that God had forgotten him it was Joseph, yet he remained faithful. The full story is told, even the account of Judah and Tamar which ended up in the birth of the root of the kingly line of Israel. Virtually everything was portrayed and accurately so. To me, the main point they really nailed was how Joseph woke up one day, still a prisoner, and by sunset he was the second most powerful man on the face of the Earth. This led to another fantastic lesson, Joseph all of a sudden had all the power anyone could want and while today we see people desire power so they can lord it over those beneath them and settle old scores, Joseph instead showed compassion. He could have easily destroyed his brothers or a least made them suffer as he had suffered but instead he displayed true character.... a lesson many in positions of power today could learn from. The story of Joseph is one of the most remarkable in Biblical history and rightly so. You can spend your hard earned dollars with confidence when you buy this movie and you will want to either loan it to others or buy it for them as a gift. It's too bad that more movies of this quality are made, especially when you consider all the technology that is available.
4 ||| Great
4 ||| i love this movie exellent service
4 ||| Excellent minus the bath scene.
4 ||| Very good movie! I really enjoyed this about the life Joseph! Ben Kingsley was outstanding!
4 ||| A wonderful story that is just very well done. Good acting, Ben Kingsley and the cast are just perfect in each of their roles. Beautiful footage of what the Holy Land must have looked like, no matter Where it was taken. The richness of the period costumes, customs, attitudes and the connection of the people to the land itself and to kin. All the details appeared to be nicely taken care of
4 ||| good movie
4 ||| great movie
4 ||| GREAT
4 ||| Good Movie
4 ||| This movie inspired a person who had no clue who Joseph was. Thank God for spiritual movies  Like these.
2 ||| they need to stay with the word of god...quit adding their own stuff to sell the movie...he never kissed potiphar's wife in the bible...he would not sin against god.....other parts were okay....seen better versions of it.....
4 ||| whats not to love, Ben Kingsley!!!!!!
4 ||| MY Favorite bible story.
4 ||| Thanks for everything.
4 ||| This is my favorite Paul Mercurio movie.  As Joseph he is a truly unharnessed character whose angst is so deep, visually apparent and so complete that we are free to empathize with him. The multi dimensional emotional conflict from within the character is so palpable that it develops its own spiritual presence in the hot tub seduction scene.  And, the gentle, sweet, forgiving demeanor of Joseph when he reveals himself to his brothers at the end just ties the story together and brings it to a close with an all encompassing forceful power that is just so refreshing.  No violence, no revenge, just powerful forgiveness mixed with a dash of gratitude for the end resulting exalted / elevated status that resulted from his brothers' betrayal.  I love using this movie to learn languages.  The layered emotion and richness makes it, for me, a movie classic.  I think Paul Mercurio movies in general are great language learning tools.  They are so interesting that I don't mind watching them many times.  And, watching anything more than once is a rare occurrence for me.  I initially saw this movie on a religious channel so the hot tub scene was edited out due to its sexy content.  It is a very crucial part of the movie, however.
4 ||| Thank You
4 ||| Great Movie.
4 ||| Good biblical interpretation and good acting!! Loved it! The story of Joseph is one of my favorite stories in the Bible.

4 ||| GREAT  PARALLED TO THE  BIBLES  ACCOUNT.
4 ||| I love this story!!
4 ||| Best Christian Movie
4 ||| Wonderful to watch. I love this particular movie.
4 ||| Joseph is a TV movie that tells the story of Joseph from the Old Testament. It stars Paul Mercurio in the title role. This is Biblical, well-acted, and the filmmakers are to be praised for the sound Biblical research. Although some of the sexually explicit scenes,it should be screened from the very young. It is an ideal platform from which teens can search out characteristics of moral uprightness in Joseph. The performances were great. Mercurio does an admirable job. The only flaw I could find in it is that it isn't powerful as other Biblical films and TV movies. But nevertheless, it still tells a good story of a man who never lost faith in the Lord amidst all the trials and sufferings that he experienced before achieving success in life.
4 ||| Awesome!!!!
4 ||| Inspirational and uplifting.
4 ||| Good re-enactment of Bible history. This is not a cheesy movie. Good acting by well-known performers. Maybe not 2015 technology but still excellent cinematography, etc. Entertaining and educational.
4 ||| This series of biblical films are really quite good.  Not totally accurate to scripture but the presentations are good.
4 ||| Lots of fabrication, but we don't really know the whole story. It helps to envision beyond the written page.
4 ||| A true classic in every word.  This is a must for biblical video collections.  But with an all star cast how could you go wrong.  They did a great job staying true to the Word as well.
4 ||| pleased with purchase
4 ||| awesome
4 ||| Outstanding film!
4 ||| Great bible story worth watching and learning the story/events.
4 ||| This epic, motion picture - JOSEPH, starring Actor: Paul Mercurio in the title role, is an engaging, true life, biblical drama straight from the Old Testament/Book of Genesis within the Holy Bible (See Genesis 30:22-24; 37:1-36 & 39:1-50:26). Written for television by: Lionel Chetwynd, this 1995 film which also features... not one, but two Academy Award winning Actors: Sir Ben Kingsley as 'Potiphar' and Martin Landau as 'Jacob', also won the prestigious Emmy Award for: "Outstanding Miniseries." And, although it focuses on the life of JOSEPH, it also chronicles the latter life of his father Jacob, together with his wives, his concubines, his only sister - Dinah, and the lives of his brothers, as well. From the popular "Bible Collection" Films of which (at this date), there are 13 available, Turner Pictures presents a Lube Production in association with Lux Beta Films and Rai Uno in presenting this disturbing yet deeply moving and climactic film: JOSEPH, in it's entirety. All, 187-minutes of it. This compelling, motion picture/miniseries, vividly depicts the willful, calculated and brutal betrayal of 17-year old JOSEPH, the 11th son of 12 brothers. Who, was maliciously sold into slavery, to appease their jealousy of him. What are older brothers for, eh?! So why..., were they so cruel and viciously envious of JOSEPH? Because he was their father's obvious favorite (Genesis 37:3-4). Sibling rivalry? Oh yeah! And, then some!! In viewing this captivating drama, one cannot help but wonder..., how it helped JOSEPH's brother's to be so jealous of him? And what did they hope to accomplish with their continued envy, scorn and contempt towards their innocent, younger brother? It certainly wasn't going to change their father's love for him. Neither, would it change the fact, that JOSEPH was the long awaited, first-born son of Jacob's favorite wife, Rachel. Nor would it diminish their feelings of paternal rejection, deep seated inadequacies and personal insecurities from which, acute jealousy, stems. But, aside from his younger brother Benjamin, his only sibling by the same mother (Rachel), the 10 older brothers and their level of jealousy towards him escalated too such a fever pitch, that initially they literally plotted to murder JOSEPH. But, due to the sanity and shrewdness of the one brother, they opted to throw him into a cold, dry, well, complete with snakes. The following morning, they literally sold him..., to Ishmaelite Slave Traders for 20 pieces of silver. Talk about betrayal, treachery, deviousness, jealousy and abject hatred! Again, was there any brotherly love, here? No way! And, they all made a profit from literally..., selling out his person. So how, did their acute jealousy help anything? It didn't. From the on-set, jealousy of another breeds resentment and hostility. Unbridled, it only suffices to kill and destroy. In this particular case, blatant deceit combined with needless treachery together with their murderous envy, sheer hatred and concealment of their vile crime, manifested itself in a heinous betrayal against their own brother. And, as if that weren't enough, they further added insult to injury by deliberately lying too their father, Jacob. How? By corporately telling him the tale, that JOSEPH was dead and gone. Because he supposedly, was killed by a wild animal. And, they 'offered' his blood stained coat which Jacob had made for him, as "proof." Meanwhile, JOSEPH... who was very much alive, was re-sold in Egypt by the Ishmaelite Slave Traders, to Potiphar - the Captain of the Pharaoh's Guard. So, as far as the envious brother's were concerned, JOSEPH was seemingly out of the picture and doomed to the wretched existence of a slave. And for years, such was the case. And Jacob, having lost his favorite son, along with his pride and joy upon whom all of his hopes of leading the family clan were founded, continued to grieve for his thought to be dead, son. Because when you truly love someone, their absence only makes the heart grow fonder. The years wore on..., and JOSEPH grew to become very handsome. He was a man of excellence and integrity, who knew how to read and write (most slaves didn't), and one who carried himself in a humble manner. As was pleasing to his master, Potiphar. However, for as much as Potiphar trusted JOSEPH... to the point that he elevated him to be his personal assistant and household accountant, so too, did Potiphar's' promiscuous wife (as portrayed by Actress: Lesley Ann Warren) decide, that she would take advantage of the situation and use JOSEPH's strong, attractive, physique for her own sexual pleasure. But, there was only one problem. JOSEPH refused to sleep with her. And she, incensed at having her advances rejected by a mere slave, spitefully and vindictively accused him of a most heinous crime. Rape. (Yup! All of this..., sex and all, is really within the Holy Bible. And, at the beginning of this review, you were provided with: Chapter, scripture and verse(s), so you can read it for yourself). So, what happened to JOSEPH? Well, having heard that his wife was supposedly raped, Potiphar stripped JOSEPH of his position and status, and further placed him into Pharaoh's prison. Where common thieves, cut throat's and all sorts of criminals are kept. Hardly the place, for an innocent and educated man, like JOSEPH. A man of breeding and integrity. However, just as Potiphar was impressed with the way JOSEPH carried himself and handled his assigned duties, so too, was the prison warden into whose prison care, JOSEPH was placed. To the point, that he elevated JOSEPH to the position of prison overseer, who was in charge of all the other prisoners. Years went by, and then came the fateful day when two of Pharaoh's employee's - a wine bearer and a baker, were placed into prison under JOSEPH's care. Utilizing his gift that the Lord had given to him (that of interpreting dreams), JOSEPH correctly foretold the dreams of both, the baker and the wine bearer. Specifically, that the wine bearer would be reinstated into Pharaoh's employ and that the baker would die in prison. It came to pass just as JOSEPH had stated, and having been restored, the wine bearer remembered and told Pharaoh about JOSEPH, when Pharaoh's' court see's could not interpret Pharaoh's dreams. JOSEPH was summoned to Pharaoh's Court and after hearing and accurately predicting the dreams of the Pharaoh, he was rewarded and promoted to the position of Governor of all, Egypt. Second only, to Pharaoh himself. Believe it! And what, became of JOSEPH's brother's? Well, suffice it to say, that the rest of this powerful drama is a story of forgiveness, healing, reconciliation and restoration. And yes, JOSEPH's brother's got a lesson that they wouldn't soon forget! This is a deeply moving, epic, biblical drama that comes to it's audience in color, on a single-disc, DVD in spoken English in 4.0 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and also, in 2.0 Dolby Digital Spanish. With subtitles in English, Spanish and French. And shows in full screen format for approximately 187-minutes. To say the least, it is a very interesting motion picture that does much more, than just entertain. It deals with human drama in relation too the God, that created..., mankind (See Genesis 1:2-28 & 2:21-25). Nina Kish
4 ||| This is amazing, a true count from the bible.  Joseph was perfect and Ben Kingsley as  Potifar was great.
4 ||| Good
4 ||| enjoyed a lot
4 ||| This is an excellent production concerning Joseph who was sold into Egypt. The acting is excellent and the sets are as well. I bought 9 of these DVDs to give to my children and to add to our collection. I would completely recommend this DVD.
4 ||| no comment
4 ||| Genesis actually comes to life again in this adaption of the life of "Joseph". Being well versed in scripture, I'm usually a tad weary of most anything that Hollywood has to offer when adapting from "The Holy Book". What a relief and pleasure it's been to see this film. The story of Joseph is one of my personal favorite accounts told from the Old Testament. What a delight it was to see this wonderful tale done so faithfully and true. And yes, the ending of this film shall bring tears to one's eyes. For any who are not familiar with scripture, then see this film. Any who does read scripture, as I do, then see this film as well. God Bless always.
4 ||| Great mini-series. Really like the story, characters and quality of the acting.
3 ||| The whole story of Joseph is not well known, but this video tells it well.  The suspense of the family dynamics are very intense.  It would be nice if families today could be so forgiving.
4 ||| Love this entire series. Joseph is very accurate to the Bible. Easy to watch and follow. Great way to teach the biblical section on Joseph, as it brings the words to life.
4 ||| Despite its long running time, this is one of my favorite movies.  The cast, the scenery, the acting and the story are all first rate.  The irony of the ending is delicious.  I have watched it many times and will watch it many more.  highly recommended.
3 ||| A nice alternative to the classic. Can be used to get the point across but it is different that the Bible in some points
4 ||| This version I liked. Went behind the scenes. Not totally accurate but great version of this story.
4 ||| I read the Bible quite often and teach Bible classes from time to time. This is a very accurate account of the "Joseph" story.
4 ||| This film is one of the better films made about stories of the Bible.  Very little poetic license was taken with it - they stuck to the scripture very closely and Sir Ben Kingsley is brilliant at Potipher.
4 ||| I must admit this bibical movie has it all. Passion,Suspense and Temptation. I think this is more for a mature audience. Due to some scenes in this film I wouldnt advise children to view it. But the cast and movie is wonderful. It's truly a movie worth watching!
4 ||| This is one of my most favorite stories in the Bible, recommend this one to anyone who loves a good Bible story.
4 ||| I own a lot of Bible stories from this series on CD. This one is particularly good. You can't beat the Holy Bible for great story lines!
4 ||| This one was really interesting!  Loved it completely.  Acting was exceptional.  It flowed so well.  I liked the temple of it.  Everything fell into place.  No fillers to eat up time.  This Movie is a Winner!
4 ||| I absolutely love learning the Bible and what God has done, is doing and will do in my life.  Movies like this one help me understand the different books of the Bible and when I read each book in the Old Testament or the New Testament and see the movies that pertain to those books, I have a clearer understanding of what I am reading.  I am very careful to buy the movies that give the true meaning of what the Bible says and not some superficial storyline that goes is not accurate with the Bible.  This movie is great and a must have if you enjoy biblical movies, true to the Bible.
4 ||| No matter how many times I watch it, it is still very moving. Excellent acting, excellent adherence to the true story, and something I will soon not forget and enjoy watching again. I bought several copies to give as gifts.
4 ||| I cannot help but notice that ALL of those who serve God have to suffer for him. Though the churches today teach you don't have to suffer, the Bible says different. I wish I were as strong as Joseph. He sure isn't a "why me" type.
4 ||| This item goes with the rest of my bible collection. It is a must have and it is close to the bible, and again you do have Hollywood theatrics
4 ||| You will enjoy the story of Joseph , it's very entertaining , it will keep you watching, what's going to happen to Joseph next . The good think about the story of Joseph is where he ends up at the end . Good story excellent film.
4 ||| I'm always on the look out for quality films but especially for the holidays. I had seen this movie many years ago on television. I believe they made it into a mini series. The acting was wonderful. The story line uplifting. Great example of faith, hard work and being true to your beliefs no matter the circumstances and hardships.
4 ||| i am a big fan of this item was so glad to get it, and it was everything i hoped it would be
4 ||| This is my go to movie for when I need to be humble. This telling of Joseph is very, very close to the Bible, and that is what I was looking for. Sometimes when you purchase this movies it is strictly Hollywood version. This time they got it right.
4 ||| All time favorite movie!!!! Based on the Biblical account of Joseph & how his brothers sold him into slavery and how God turned the situation all around!!  Excellent movie.  If you've never read the story or saw the movie - this is a must.  Its' stellar performances by the actors makes it even more enjoyable.  One word of caution, the scene where Potifar's wife tries to seduce Joseph while bathing is extremely steamy & sexual. That's unfortunate because other than that scene and one other scene that's sexual in nature, this would have been an excellent movie to watch with a church group.  But in my opinion, it's too steamy for mixed company and/or church viewing.  Other than that, it's an A+++++ movie!!!  The ending will bring you to tears!
4 ||| As a Born Again Christian <3 ALL BY FATHER GODS GRACE <3 I Love this version Of Joseph. Very Accurate <3 I 'WAS" An Alcoholic <3 PRAISE THE LORD <3 Started to drink at 8 years old.

4 ||| Acting was very good, the story line was well done and included all the important parts of the tale  without adding too much conjecture in.
4 ||| Very well done.  Great acting for most of it.  towards the end the main character loses me a little bit, but for the most part I like it a lot.
3 ||| Though it's been a while, I recall this as being a rather excellent film.  Peter Chattaway tells us that "disparate elements are woven into Joseph's story without sacrificing the film's dramatic unity; the result is unexpectedly coherent, even poignant....[It]is about as rich a three-hour epic as one could want from television: complex, challenging and convincing, it has enough emotional power to draw you into its world and enough realism to make you want to stay there (Review: The Bible Collection, Patheos(dot)com, 1996)
4 ||| This is an excellent movie which I have used in Sunday School.  The youth were able to envision the Bible's narrative in Genesis much more clearly because of the fine acting and appreciative telling of the Joseph story.
4 ||| I love the story of Joseph and his brothers.  As the world might say, a tale of Joseph,  Nothing in the Bible is a tale or fabricated as the world might say.  Love the actor also love Ben Kingsley.
4 ||| Joseph clearly tells how God can use anyone.  Despite his background of brothers who hated him and sold him into slavery, he held on through prison years in Egypt and became the second highest, most powerful leader in Egypt.  When his brothers finally came to the realization that this leader under Pharoah was indeed their very own brother, it was then that Joseph forgave them for what transpired in his youth.  It's a lesson we can all take to heart.
4 ||| This was a great DVD. It tells the story of Joseph and his family. Good for the whole family and great for reinforcing your knowledge of the Bible.
4 ||| Great movie. Excellent acting and definitely not boring. Thank God like most Bible based movies these days this movie is exceeding with talent
3 ||| A believable re-telling of the story while respecting it. Exceptional performances by stellar cast. And all of it at a great price!
4 ||| to see how they take a name from bible (JOSEPH)  and turn it in to a dvd movie to show how it was in the bible days
4 ||| One of the best-done Bible movies ever, if not the very best.  I'm a pastor.  Great acting; great story telling.  Pretty good regarding Biblical faithfulness.  The theology in this has nothing objectionable, and I'm a stickler on getting theology right, since that's my job.  Even the extra-Biblical stuff that's in the movie is not Biblically-off.  Great theological themes pervade the movie.  Like someone else said, I could've done without the bath scene.  There's no nudity in it, and something like this might have happened, sure; but it makes me unable to hand the DVD over to my younger daughters.  I always have to watch this with them and flip by that scene when it comes up.  Don't let that deter you from buying this, though.  This is in the series done by Ted Turner.  I wish Christians, in making Biblical movies, would be as theologically and Biblically accurate and excellent as this film.  Bravo!  I love this movie.
4 ||| I thought the movie was sufficiently close to the Bible story. The sets were often lacking, but I enjoyed the movie anyway. I had a copy that I bought with the Bible Collection 7 or 8 years ago that I loaned out and never got back. I was happy to get this at around $7. I recommend the Bible Collection highly.
4 ||| This is a fantastic movie or the retelling of the Story of Joseph.  The scenery in the movie is fantastic too.  The actors are great in each of their roles.  I'm glad I ordered this movie.  Saw it many years ago.
4 ||| I have watched this movie several times.  I really enjoy it.  It is an accurate account from the Bible.   Thanks candpfoote
4 ||| Just what I ordered. No surprises. I am a pastor and we just  finished studying the book of Genesis and w finished that book by watching this movie.
4 ||| This is my favorite movie of all times. It is so realistic that I cry every time I watch. The characters are extremely good in their acting, and I especially enjoyed the Joseph character, Paul Mercurio. I would definatly  recommend this movie!!
3 ||| I liked this movie, except one scene where Potipher's wife is seducing Joseph, and he has a hard time resisting at first, whereas, Biblically, I think he was stronger than that.  I REALLY like the actor playing Potipher.  Because of the scene mentioned, I am hesitant to allow my younger children to view it. But, other than that, it was done excellently.
4 ||| As most movies, this story takes a little liberty with Bible history; the way the story is laid out, it brings reality to the likely interaction between Joseph, his family and those he met in Egypt.  A warning to parents - the DVD has scenes you may not have seen in the tv version (a couple of them gratuitous-a scene showing nudity in the pool of his wife and children and the hanging of the baker); the scene with Joseph and Potiphar's wife does a great job of showing just how difficult it must have been for Joseph to stand firm in his principles (would be a little mature for young audiences).
4 ||| gave it as a gift to my sister she love it.  a good telling of the life of Joseph, son of jacob.
4 ||| I used this movie in my prison ministry bible study. It was very well done and followed the bible very closely. Joseph as revealed in the book of Genesis of the scripture is a type of Jesus and the movie brought this out which shows an obvious insight and knowledge do God's word. I would highly recommend this DVD for all family viewing.
4 ||| I had these three DVD, this one Joseph and David and Abraham for a long time. I believe it was in the late 1990,s and I got them on VHS and then I donated them to a nursing home because I knew they would really enjoy them. And then I  brought them on DVD. So I have enjoyed this movies for a long time. I also got Abraham on VHS and I gave it away and brought it on DVD. All were excellent.
4 ||| This movie is very inspirational to me, it helped me through my trails and tribulations during the time I needed it most, this movie relates to me.
4 ||| This portrayal of Joseph's story is very good.  It is biblically pretty accurate and features good performances by the actors.  I recommend it to individual and family audiences!  It's one of the great stories of the Bible.
2 ||| If it weren't for the seduction scene with Potiphar's wife, this movie would have been excellent.  That scene was so sensual that it was borderline "R" rated in our book.  I almost shut it off at that scene.  Before the actual Biblical account of Jospeh running off, leaving his garment behind him, there is a scene in which Potiphar's wife joins him in a bathing room and (while he is in a pool) clearly and very erotically reaches her hands under the water and strokes his private parts.  He doesn't flee that time!  This scene ruined the movie for us, and though we've enjoyed other movies from this series, we couldn't keep this movie because of that one scene.  Too bad!
4 ||| This is a brilliant epic movie, a tour de force, the best Biblical movie I have seen with the exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/One-Night-with-the-King/dp/B000JJSJO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">One Night with the King</a>&nbsp;Starring Paul Mercurio in the title role, he gives an intelligent and passionate performance of a man who was prepared to die, to keep to the word of his G-D. Ben Kingsley is his usual magnificent self in his role of Potiphar which he plays with panache. Warren Clark played a sterling role as Potiphar's thuggish overseer Domo Ednan, later to be Joseph's aid de camp. A deliciously evil Potiphar's Wife is captured in brilliant detail by Lesley Ann Warren and the actors playing the ten brothers also acquit themselves well staying true to the form of Israelite tribesman  The movie begins with the purchase of Joseph by Potiphar, and his rise from that of a lowly slave to Potiphar's major domo where he captures the attention of Potiphar's evil wife, when he resists her attention and she accuses him of assaulting her, Potiphar soon knows he is innocent, and he embarks on the telling of his story of his boyhood, including the narrative of the rape of his half-sister  Dinah (played with shyness and prettiness by Mexican actress Paloma Baeza), and the destruction of the Canaanite town of Schechem  in revenge by her brothers Simeon (Vincenzo Nicoli) and Levi (Colin Bruce) Then we move to the central story whose tale baring and father's favour lead to his brother's brutal attack of him, where he is thrown into a pit and sold to Ishmaelite traders.  His rise in prison, his interpretation of the dreams of Pharaoh (Stefano Dionisi) at the same time as we are taken back to Canaan and see the story of Tamar( a pert and beautiful Kelly Miller ) and Judah (Michael Attwell). The final sequence where Joseph's brothers go down to Egypt until the moving scene where he reveals himself to his brothers is the finest. The sex scenes are tasteful and not at all gratuitous in any way , and yes this is an adult movie, but they simply cover what is told in the Bible without going further and it is extremely narrow minded to find them offensive
4 ||| I recommend this movie, Joseph. It is a great reprentation of  of a truly kind, just, and merciful God and the people He loves. We all need positive and true to life movies that are not only good for the heart, but for the soul.
4 ||| Ah, my favorite Bible story. After watching this and seeing how well produced it was, I can only say that I watch it ast lease twice a month.
4 ||| This movie is very thoughtful and insightful in the portrayal of Joseph of Egypt. I would highly recommend this movie to all.
4 ||| I have used this movie several times (VCR version) in prison ministry.  The women respond well to the visuals of the Biblical story of Joseph.  I do warn them & you that certain liberties have been taken in the movie.  I object to the portrayal of Potiphar's wife with Joseph.  If you plan to use this with children, teens, or those unfamiliar with the Biblical record, you should preview and provide advance instruction.  Also the encounter between Tamar & Judah needs Biblical background.  However, I do recommend the video.
4 ||| A movie never presents a story exactly as you envisioned it, but nevertheless, every movie version you see gives you new insights into the story.  This is a very Biblically accurate version of the Joseph story, not changing the Biblical story but rather developing it.  (For example, in this version, Potiphar believes Joseph is innocent of immorality with his wife, and Joseph tells him about his past as a flashback, not found in the Bible.)  The massacre at Shechem in Genesis 34 is included and shows what rotten people some of Joseph's brothers were.  The actors for the brothers do very well demonstrating individuality but also a group mentality, and they show powerful character change by the end.  It's interesting that the movie shows the brothers have really changed just by showing their eager attitude in blessing the name of God with their father Jacob ("Blessed be His name")!  The actor for Jacob does very well, too.  (The actor for Joseph is fine, too, but the character couldn't have too much personality, because every viewer has a preconceived expectation of what he should be like.)  The movie introduced me to an interesting idea, which is that Jacob may have been involved in preserving genealogies and stories from Abraham.  The Book of Genesis does have a much more continuous account of Jacob's life, whereas stories of Abraham's life are like disconnected snapshots.  So what I got most out of this movie was the interesting idea that the Book of Genesis was recorded before Moses' time.
4 ||| This is a wonderful story of the beginning rise of the nation of Israel.  I would almost rate this movie as good as the Ten Commandments.  I found myself in tears at the end of this movie so new watchers beware!
4 ||| This movie is extremely well made. It is so touching when Joseph's brothers throw him into a pit. His crying and pleading with them to be merciful is so moving as is the part when Joseph finally meets his brothers again and tells them who he really is. Exceptionally well made, I recommend this movie as high as possible.  A true hero in a world of doubt and sorrows it helps to know that human issues of understanding, forgiveness and love are always with us and always have been.
4 ||| One of the better bible stories out there.
0 ||| The acting was good, the story was correct, but naked backsides was not necessary.  Also the Potiphers wife did not need to be so very seductive of a naked Joseph. Not a Christian movie.  I felt that even though it was probably portrayed truthfully, Christans do not need to see so explicit a scene.  This should be rated PG 13 at least.
4 ||| This film was expertly directed and brought out many good points of the history of Joseph. I would highly recommend this disk to anyone.
4 ||| Very good movie.  Another great Bible character truly comes to life and is a good message for the family.
4 ||| My son has been collecting the different books of the bible for a while now.  He is so excited that I am able to order these from Amazon.  He has a few more DVD'S that we need to order to complete his collection.  I'm am very pleased with the DVD and quick shipment.
3 ||| This telling of the story of Joseph in the TNT Bible Collection is very good.  Although certain liberties were taken with the account as fleshed out in the Bible, these did not impact the overall telling of the story in keeping with what the Bible reveals.  The use of Joseph telling of his early history with his brothers and how he came to be a slave in Egypt was done as a flashback, which actually enhanced the dramatic telling of the story.  Very nicely done and mostly true to the Bible account.
4 ||| There are no words accurate enough to praise this enthralling television miniseries.  "Joseph" is one of the most fascinating of biblical accounts, and I will not rehash the plot since it is done superbly by other reviewers here.  I will simply say that this timeless true account of a faithful and courageous young man is a wonderful tool to use with teenagers.  Satan has planted so much filth in the movie industry, and I praise God that there are filmmakers who still desire to present the truth.  "Joseph" presents a magnificent story of forgiveness and integrity that all teenagers can learn from.  This miniseries is one of the best biblical retellings in film fashion I've ever come across.  The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull.  Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph, presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character.  Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once.  The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears.  Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all.  Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher, portraying a man of integrity and care.  The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent.  Several reviewers have complained about the scene with Joseph and Potipher's wife, a femme fatale portrayed with unabashed glee by Leslie Ann Warren.  This scene is sexually charged, but I believe it is accurate with Scripture.  The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things, nor should we think the Bible hereos were not susceptible to temptation.  Although God never reveals if Potipher's wife was a temptation to Joseph, I logically don't see how she could not have ben.  He was, after all, seventeen when the attempted seduction took place.  Wouldn't any of us struggle in this area at this age? Besides, seeing Joseph struggle makes the viewer empathize with his predicament.  Anyway, I say this only to encourage you not to let this one scene put you off.  Please give this wonderful film a chance.  Happy viewing, and God bless you.
4 ||| Joseph is amazing story to read and watch.  A person with the lord's help goes through trail. goes from a lowely shepard boy to the second highest person in Egypt.
4 ||| I really loved this movie ,it describes the biblical account pretty accurate. it starts w/ Joseph being sold to Egypt and backtracks after Joseph is accused from Potiphars wife, when Joseph defends himself in front of Potiphar through telling him his life story. I was clued to the screen the whole time. Also the actor for Joseph is very likable and also Jacob(Martin Landau) did a great performance.
4 ||| This is an incredible telling of the story of Joseph and the roller coaster ride on which he rode.  One of many Biblical Old Testament stories made by Turner Films and this is of very high quality.  Not the wooden-like acting which is not uncommon in Biblical story telling in some past films.  This is first-class and definitely worth 5 stars.
1 ||| This film is closer to the Biblical text of this account, than any we've yet seen....it's very emotional and very encouraging as well.  Long film, but not too long!  The only real problem (meaning unacceptable) is the bath-tub scene with Joseph.  He's seen from waist up, in a pool relazing/bathing, and in comes his boss's wife who's been after him sexually.  Potiphar's wife seductively rubs up and down his chest, until (WITH MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS GOING ALONG WITH THE SEDUCTIVITY) she goes down into the water below his waist and connects with his genitals (yes, for real).  Both Joseph and her are shown to react to the moment ever so...."slightly" and then she leaves him alone until the next time she confronts him.  We had this film for YEARS and thought how awesomely Biblical (compared to any other film) this movie was, but never noticed this part until this year.  Why?  because we had younger children at the time, and so the inferred sexual tension of her rubbing his shoulders over the bath-tub/pool was something we'd simply pass by w/ the fast-fwd button a mere several seconds.  We didn't do that this year, and WHOOOAH!!  We were SHOCKED at what transpired in those few moments.  They don't show below the water, but they PLAY UP the moment big time to let you know what is happening.  For this reason, i say DON'T BUY THE MOVIE unless you can edit it.  If i had this film on VCR, i'd simply tab the "edit" tab on the VCR tape and i'd record a whole minute or two over that one moment (which wouldn't hurt a 3-plus hour long film!).  It's truly a shame that the film makers snuck in a scene of this degree, they simply could have ended with the woman rubbing Joseph's shoulders in flirtation (showing her constant pursuit of him) and played up the moment that way, at that time.  However, they stuck a little leaven in to satisfy Hollywood and to "leaven the whole loaf" with making it clear that she was touching his genitals for a bit and he was helpless to deal with the tempation for a few moments.  This cheap move by the film makers reminds me of the "Sampson" film put out by the Bible Collection film makers....which is TOTALLY TRASHY...taking the sexuality way OVERBOARD for the Sampson screen (don't buy it! My family was apalled!).  Again, i say if you cannot edit the movie, DON'T BUY IT.
4 ||| This movie kept as true to the actual bible as any movie I have ever seen. A good example of how God's miracles sometimes take a whole life time.
3 ||| Overall, I enjoyed this movie, espescially its ending. The casting was great (Okay fine, Josephs former master was a white woman, so what? She played her part well I thought). Sexually explicit scenes? Give me a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes. There was a scene of Joseph in the bath being tempted by Potiphar's wife. This is no different from a man/woman dealing with sexual thoughts/temptations daily, and that powerful scene would give any Christian in the spirit a visual illustration of the pressure Joseph felt. I especially liked his line when he said to her "please, you push the limits of my body to more than it can bear." The other added scenes did not take anything away from the movie, but gave it dimension. I will take 1 star away only because I do not think that scene where the brother slept with the "prostitute" who turned out to be his other brothers wife or whatever was necessary. Besides one or two minor things, overall I thought it was a great film, and the reunion at the end was well acted.  To the critics harping on sexually explicit, blah blah, gimme a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes in the film. Everything was very "PG-13" if not lower. If you call that sexually explicit then you should be censoring Songs of Solomon in the Bible which gives some steamy accounts from Solomon to his "lover," or better yet, you should censor Jesus Christs crucifixion, which was very R-rated (being beaten, flogged, and nailed to a cross seems R-rated to me). Christianity focuses on the heart before appearances so lets all appreciate this great adaptation of Joseph's life. Great film!
4 ||| I'm very glad to have found this movie on dvd. I have seen it in stores; but it was more affordable through Amazon. I look forward to viewing the movie "Joseph" , perhaps with some friends, becauce I am currently studying the life of Joseph. I recommend the film to anyone who has yet to see it. Many thanks. SHAWN
4 ||| This movie is almost like the story of Joseph, thats written in the Bible. Joseph was a remarkable man! If only the leaders of the world today was like Joseph was, a wise man, who listened to God, and kept the Ten Commandments!   Please read God's story of Joseph, thats in the book of Geneis, in the Holy Bible first, so that you can know Gods true account of Joseph firsthand! This is a awesome, and remarkable true story, of so long ago!   My favorite part of the movie, is when Joseph meets the Pharoah of Egypt face to face! WOW! This movie was very well done, this movie is one of my favorite versions of Joseph! God blessed Joseph greatly, and had big plans for him all along, for living his life as a godly man! I loved the way Joseph, and his Egyption master(Ben Kingsley), became friends, and earned each others trust and respect, eventhough Joseph was still a slave.   It always amazed me, how Joseph was able to forgive his brothers, especially after what they did to him! Joseph was a very wise, and brillant man! I highly recommend this movie, it is based on a very true, and awesome story, thats in the HOLY BIBLE! This movie is very good, and I loved it very much! You will end up watching it more than once!
4 ||| I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good, the costumes inhanced the film, and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't.
4 ||| As described and fast shipping.
4 ||| As described and fast shipping.
4 ||| Magnificent acting, writing, directing, set design--the story is extremely compelling and the ending uplifting. It teaches many principles of virtue without in the least being preachy. There is much conflict, suspense, surprise, and believable twists in this absorbing drama. I watched it many times and learned many useful lessons from it. Buy it and enjoy it.
4 ||| This is the best and most accurate rendition of Joseph's life.  This is great for the family.
4 ||| This is another excellent addition to TNT's Bible collection. It tells the story of Joseph, the son who rose from a slave to the Viceroy of Egypt.  Joseph is the favored son of his father, a fact which causes no small amount of jealousy from his other brothers. It eventually causes so much resentment that they sell him as a slave to a passing caravan and tell his father that he was killed. In slavery, he is taken to Egypt. His intelligence and honest are both a curse to him and a blessing. Through God's favor, and Joseph's steadfastness, he rises to a position of immense power. When his brothers come to him, seeking help, they do not recognize him and the stage is set for either reconciliation or terrible retribution.  The story is well done and is in keeping with the scriptures. At first, it can be a bit confusing because it relies on flashbacks that are not always immediately apparent but this is soon gotten over. The result is a good story done well.
4 ||| I was extremely skeptical when this movie came out.  I mean, what kind of movie can Bible-basher Ted Turner produce on one of the great heroes of the Bible - Joseph?  Boy was I wrong.  This is one of my all-time favorite movies and the best part is it faithfully tells the story directly out of the Bible with very few Hollywood additions.  The acting is great.  The actors are well known and correctly cast.  Even the unknown lead of Joseph (Paul Mercurio) does a wonderful job.  Even the scenes and settings are wonderful.  Two thumbs way up!!  For fans of this movie, look for other TNT offerings in this series - Moses, Abraham, David, Jacob, and others.  Most of them are equally good - with I think David being my next favorite followed by Abraham.
4 ||| I would have to say that this is one of the best "made-for-TV" (on TNT) biblical films I've seen. The acting was phenominal, the scenery..EVERYTHING. This movie is dead-on when it comes to accuracy from the Bible, which is pretty rare..almost unheard of in this day in age. It's a refreshing movie that has an honest, uplifting theme that will inspire you and your family. It could have easily been released in the theaters and it probably could have been bigger in popularity with a wider-span of audience around the world. Even so, I'm just glad that I can now buy the DVD! :)
4 ||| This film is a recounting of the Genesis tale of Joseph.  Joseph is the most loved son of his father, and has a gift for prophecy.  His older brothers hate him because of it and sell him into slavery.  Joseph winds up in Egypt where he eventually becomes the second most powerful man in the kingdom after the Pharoah.  During a famine, Joseph's brothers come to Egypt begging for grain, not knowing that the man who will decide their fate is their brother (whom they believe to be dead).  This is one of a series of made for TV movies about important figures in the Old Testament.  I've previously reviewed several other stories in this series, but this is the best of a strong series in my view.  The acting is top notch, and I found the final confrontation between Joseph and his brothers to be particularly moving and well done.  Like many of the films in this series, it is a story about faith and perserverance.  The writer and producer did a particularly good job of fleshing out the story of Joseph from Genesis without adding lots of non-Biblical threads.  One thing that I like about this movie (and about the series as a whole) is that they are not overdone.  These aren't special effects-laden films with casts of thousands, but rely on writing and good acting to convey the tale.  The sets and the costumes are realistic and give the film a Biblical feel without being ostentatious.  The bottom line is that this is, in my opinion, the way that the Bible should be brought to film.
4 ||| This entire series of Bible stories by this Italian production group is simply splendid.  These are relatively low cost films but they are very skillfully produced to maximize the quality of the story being told.  Of course we Christians and Jews will sit around and pontificate about every little error or short cut the movie script incurs, never the less, it is ultimately left to the actors and directors and their considerable skill to pull off what I consider to be, for the most part, some of the most successfully done Bible story dramatizations that have ever been produced on film, with or without a big budget.  My favorite is the story of Abram, the movie Joseph coming in a close second, and this movie, Moses, coming in a close third or even equalling Joseph.  Bravo bravo - Please make more!  My five stars applies to this complete series of movies - Obviously some are done a little better than others, but the effort is exemplary.
3 ||| This was one of the best movie from a Old Testament Biblical story.  The only problem with this is the nude scene when "Joseph" was nude in the water.  I think  this could have been left out and the story would had been perfect.
4 ||| I LOVED this movie. It was very well made and held my interest from beginning to end.
3 ||| A truly wonderfully made film, mostly accurate to scripture and brilliantly acted. Joseph's brothers are the stars here in their own right but Paul Mecurio is in fine form as well.
4 ||| "Joseph" is an epic motion picture; another excellent and inspiring Bible story which was creatively and sensitively produced. It traces the story of Joseph in Genesis and brings it to life in a powerful and compelling way.  This film did a good job of interpretation the Biblical story on the life of Joseph. The production is superb and settings are excellent. Everyone of the cast was perfect for their parts. Paul Mercurio plays Joseph exceptionally well. Equally impressive is Lesley Ann Warren who plays as Potiphar's lewd wife who unsuccessfully attempts to ensnare Joseph. Also marvellous to watch is Martin Landau (Jacob) and Joseph's eleven brothers. The supporting cast was fantastic.  Although I have read the story of Joseph, this film brings it to life and reinforces my understanding of it. I thoroughly enjoyed the film which was very well done.  The only area that one may criticize is the very white actors when in fact the people at the time were much darker in complexion. However, this shortcoming is compensated by the accuracy of the actual biblical account of the story which is rare in many biblical productions.  Overall impression: a pleasant and well acted movie that was a joy to watch that I highly recommend for those who need to reinforce their knowledge of the Bible and appreciate a well-done movie based on it.
4 ||| The series are amazing! Thank God such biblical figures are protrayed with the  Lord God as foundation.  I was expecting those usual blurry versions, but this is entirely different. Its a way to invite friends and know the characters in the bible and how they can relate that man in his nature is sinful and only through the Lord's grace can we only be part of the family.  The story shows the fallen nature of man---jealousy, anger etc and it also shows that God knows the heart of men and gives according to His own glory.  Watch it!
4 ||| Joseph is my favorite movie out of the Bible Collection. I am going to get one movie at a time as I can afford it until I have the whole collection.
4 ||| Although I had enjoyed the Bible movies that were broadcast by Turner on TNT, "Joseph" turned out to be a cut above the rest in regard to the scope of the production, the writing, and the performances of the actors. It really seemed to capture the essence of the story in the book of Genesis.
4 ||| Joseph is the ideal role model for EVERY Christian/Jew. He is an example of what we should strive for. Waiting for a spouse to have sex. Sticking to your God no matter the outcome. This movie reflects all of that perfectly. The actors did a great job. When I first saw this years ago I was blown away by the quality!! That was back in the VHS days...cant wait to see it on DVD. So I cant speak for the transfer quality yet, sorry.
4 ||| This WONDERFUL film is a total treat on every level! I admit my reason for the first viewing was strictly as an enthusiast of films set in ancient Egypt. On this level, the film is probably the best I've seen to recreate what that era must have really been like. The sets and costumes have a complete feel of reality, unlike the many  "Hollywoodized" Egyptian ventures. But, that's not the reward I got by the end of the film. It's as much a tear-jerker as the old Ross Hunter/Lana Turner films! And, the performances, especially that of Paul Mercurio in the title role, (WHY don't we see more work from him?), Martin Landau as his father Jacob, Ben Kingsly as the Egyptian over-seer Pontiphur, and Lesly Ann Warren as his wife, are exceptional! There is even a most erotically charged scene or two between Pontiphur's adulteress wife and a scantily clad Joseph. Most everyone already knows the story. Joseph is the favored son of his father, inspiring lethal jealousy from his other sons, Joseph's brothers. They conspire to get rid of Joseph, but can't bring themselves to actually kill him, so they sell him into slavery. He ends up in Egpyt and, over the years, thanks to his talent for explaining the meanings of dreams, rises to a position of power second only to Pharaoh. Circumstances reunite Joseph with his brothers, although they don't know who he is. The revelation of his identity to them and his reunion with his father will touch the heart of anyone who has one! Originally shown as a 2-part TV mini-series by TNT a few years ago, I'm eagerly awaiting the DVD release - uninterrupted by commercials, and including a making-of featurette. Don't let this jewel get by you!
4 ||| When this film debuted in 1994 as a miniseries on television, at a time when biblical stories were being made into miniseries, I was skeptical because I had been disappointed in the stories of Abraham and Jacob.  This film, though, is the best filmed biblical interpretation of the life of Joseph.  It is truly astounding with a stellar cast!  Paul Mercurio is incomparable as Joseph and deserved an emmy for his performance.  He tears the heart right out of you!  No less superb is Lesley Ann Warren as Potiphar's lascivious wife who tries to snare him into her web but fails.  This film is incredible and not to be missed!  I always cry buckets of tears at the end!  A true masterpiece in every way!
4 ||| Though this interpretation of Joseph's life has been substantially embellished, the heart and soul of the story remain intact, and is ultimately quite faithful to the Biblical account covered in Genesis Ch. 33:18 through Ch. 46:30. Much of the acting is marvelous, especially Ben Kingsley as Potiphar, whose part has thankfully been enlarged, because he is riveting in every scene he is in. Martin Landau is also excellent as the patriarch Jacob, who mourns the apparent loss of his favorite son, Joseph. Australian actor/dancer Paul Mercurio ("Strictly Ballroom") is good in the lead, and others in the cast include Leslie Ann Warren as Potiphar's lying wife, the always beautiful Dominique Sanda as Leah, and some fine character actors playing Joseph's brothers, notably Michael Attwell (Judah), and Vincenzo Nicoli (Simeon). Included in this film, and intrinsic to Joseph's life are the stories of Tamar and Judah, and the horrific tale his sister Dinah, both done effectively. The only parts that are less than first-rate are the scenes in Pharoah's court; almost campy in costuming and acting, they can provide some amusement in the midst of all the drama. Stefano Dionisi is a most unlikely and modern looking Pharoah, and has the ultimate babe for a wife, the pulchritudinous Monica Bellucci. The entire film though, is always mentally and visually entertaining, and has much spiritual content. As with so much of the Old Testament, there are allegories that run through its narrative that point to the New Testament, and the story of Joseph has much of this symbolism. Filmed in Quarzazate, Morocco, with its exotic ancient structures and landscapes, the cinematography by Rafaele Mertes is wonderful; this is a way above average production for television, and a film about a man who "does nothing against his conscience even on pain of death" is worth watching again and again.
4 ||| Having just seen this movie for the first time last night, I have to say that in spite of the very white actors in a culture that would clearly be darker in appearance, this movie in writing, production, and acting overcame that one glaring inconsistency with accuracy and with beauty. Bible in hand, we marveled to see that this story followed the actual biblical account with astounding accuracy almost never seen in biblical productions.  Entirely enjoyable and a marvelously acted piece, my entire family loved this movie.  We had been expecting another biblical mish mash eliciting merely yawns, but were startled to see such a wonderful movie. Martin Landau (Jacob) gave a fantastic performance, as did Ben Kingsley(Potiphar), Paul Mercurio(Joseph) (which bumps STRICTLY BALLROOM out of #1 on my Paul Mercurio list of favorite performances), Leslie-Anne Down was good as Potiphar's wife, and the 11 brothers of Joseph were fabulous.  The supporting cast was excellent. The sensitive and well rounded way in which this story was handled was fresh, creative, yet took no liberties in veering from the original story.  Although it is not as spectacular in production as THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and other such movies, this movie was more like it "really" would have happened complete with humanity in all of its misery and magnificence. I can not speak highly enough of this movie.  What a pleasant surprise.  We even got a chuckle out of it now and then!
3 ||| This four hour video looks a the familiar "Joseph" story from the Bible but with a few wonderful twists.  First, it just jumps into the Egyptian setting.  Second most of the actors do a great job on their roles -- I want to say "brava" to Leslie Ann Warren for making Potiphar's wife engaging and even more scary than the original tale suggests.  Finally, the customs and backgrounds are the best yet that I've seen in a film version of the tale.  However, my "four star" rating refers to the "flashback" section of the film.  Yes, why it happens makes sense internally but did they need to spend so much time on it?  It very sad that Paul Mercurio's careers seems to have turned off onto the "B" grade track -- I think he is excellent in this movie and also in Exit to Eden.
3 ||| Of all the TNT movies, this one is actually the weakest. But it is still a good movie. The movie covers the period before Esau sold his birthright and blessing to Jacob through his time with Laban and finally his confrontation with Laban and later Esau. The disappointment with this movie was its over-focus on him and Rachel. The lessons God was teaching him were kind of talked about, but not focused on. The non-Scriptural parts, though, were pretty consistent with early Near Eastern customs and not contrary to Scriptural understanding. In that way, it was very good. If you choose to watch this movie, you won't find yourself wishing you hadn't. It is a good movie and well produced. Just be sure you don't base much theology on it. ;-) The movie is a solid PG movie.
4 ||| This account of the Joseph story is as good as it gets! I teach ancient history and civilizations, and have an earned doctorate in theology. I say this only to lend perspective to this review. This film is Biblically accurate, well-acted, and the producer and director are to be praised for the sound Biblical reasearch! Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young, this film is an ideal platform from which teens can search out characteristics of moral uprightness in a character of whom the Bible has not one negative thing to say! Kingsley (as he did in 'Moses') steals the show, and Mercurio does an admirable job as Joseph. Only Leslie Ann Warren (Potipher's wife) seems to strain as an actor, nevertheless, her performance detracts little from the drama. Especially capable are the actors portraying Joseph's wicked brothers, with Vincenzo Nicoli sterling is his performance as the wicked Simeon. Having watched the film dozens of times with adults--as well as with my middle-schoolers in the classroom, I can say that the greatest of Bible stories is captured in all its power, pathos, and glory. Although creating a few anachronistic vignettes (such as Joseph's 'foreshadowing' Christ's "My God, my God..." speech from the Egyptian prison), the film also captures all of the great ironies of the Joseph story. When Mercurio tenderly reveals himself as the second most powerful man in the ancient world--to the brothers who hated him as a youth, the words 'I am Joseph' will not fail to bring even the most calloused heart to tears. As my students synthesized the thirty or so characteristics of moral goodness extant in Joseph into an essay, one asked why no such heroes existed today. The question revealed both the effectiveness of this presentation, and the dearth of role models in our society. 'Joseph' is both gripping in narration, and brilliant its direction. It is faithful to Scripture and well-acted. It is THE finest of the TNT productions to date, of which only one ('Jacob') was a failure. Everyone will appreciate this wonderful story of forgiveness, but those those who are looking for the 'hidden things of Christ' cannot miss the poignant messianic threads which are so skillfully woven through the life of Joseph. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
2 ||| Songs are good but need a bit more diversity.  I would like my kids to see other kids that look like them in more than just a random passing image.
2 ||| Not really action songs.
0 ||| This is not a sing along dvd and it was difficult to understand some of the words being sung. I would not recommend it.
3 ||| Our 20-month-old and 4.5-year-old love this video that contains many of the favorite Bible songs I remember from my childhood.  The music and singing is good quality, and the scenes behind the music are interesting -- children playing, acting out some of the words, like rock climbing during "Climb up Sunshine Mountain" -- even a farm full of animals during the Noah song.  Unfortunately, only a few of the songs feature all of the actions (hand motions and body movement) that make these songs favorites for children.  It's such a shame, because the primary reason I bought this DVD was to encourage full-body participation and movement instead of passive viewing.  Still, the production is good-quality (not overproduced and grating like the DVD of the same name by Golden Books).  When our kids leave it on and walk away, it actually makes decent background music, as children's music goes.  To be sure, this is the best children's music DVD we own (yes, even more popular with our kids than the Wiggles) -- that is, until we find a DVD of action Bible songs that actually features the actions.
3 ||| This film is a classic true story about the Son of God taken entirely from the Gospel of Luke. I also recommend a video called the Gospel of John, get the 3 hour version it is totally worth it! The Gospel of John is a 5 star film.
2 ||| I was initially moved by this film when I saw it on its theatrical release. It is a simplistic, realistic retelling of the Gospel of Luke. Now more than thirty years later, it doesn't resonate as well. More recent productions of the same storyline are more emotional, awestruck and have better photography and musical scores, but this version of Jesus is a pure bread and butter version especially suited for those not yet familiar with the teachings of Jesus and need an initiation presented in a plain and simple way. A few years ago, this same evangelical production company created a wrap-around version of the film centered on the conversion of Mary Magdaline which, oddly enough, seemed more affecting than the original.
2 ||| I bought this movie on advice that many Jewish traditions are shown in the depiction of Christ.  This movie is a faithful but not very high tech.  The miracles are usually explained or the viewer is expected to know what happened.  This is a good telling but not in the league of "The Greatest Story Ever Told".
3 ||| The Visual Bible Matthew word for word was excellent as compared, but this complete message is great too.  This film invites a decision concerning Christ.
3 ||| I did enjoy the movie. It seemed to follow scripture very well. I shared the movie with my parents as I had it already under a different jacket. I am sure anyone will like the movie and it is good for all family members.
3 ||| Jesus is a 1979 film starring Brian Deacon in the role of Jesus. This version is based on the Gospel according to Luke. It is very accurate and if one reads the gospel along whilst watching the film one will see that they have done a great job. As with any film there are however problems. For instance, the music sounds on the cheap and sometimes the editing feels less then professionally done. Brian Deacon is very good in the role as Jesus and he plays the role with conviction. The ending is not that great and they could have left it out. Even so it was a quite good film. Recommended. 4/5.
2 ||| Nice teaching tool. The message is clear even though production values are low. It looks and sounds like an episode of Little House on the Prairie. Definitely not a major motion picture or epic. But it does well at telling the story of Jesus: the son of man who was born to be the son of God, nothing more and nothing less.
2 ||| This was told from the Gospel of Luke. It is a nice story, Slightly dated. If I saw this used for a few dollars, I might pick it up.
2 ||| All I wanted was a dvd of this movie the way I saw it on cable tv. But NOOOOOOOOO! They had to ruin the movie by tagging a 5 minute preachy ask Jesus into your life message. And omitted some written scripture that scrolled the screen at the end of the film with an astronomy back drop.
2 ||| With the huge success of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Jesus-of-Nazareth/dp/B0000633QW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Jesus of Nazareth</a>&nbsp;(1977), the Inspirational Film Distributors Inc. presented A Genesis Project Production, "Jesus" (1979).  From the very beginning they tell you this film is a documentary taken entirely from the Gospel of Luke, Chapters 3-24.  This is the film that has been translated into so many languages and still is.  The film is very fast-paced. So fast that much of the storytelling is not told.  They leave out so many years and do not fully explain or dramatize very important details.  Filmed in Israel.  This film does include Jesus was "alive" (arisen) from the tomb, spoke to his diciples and then in 40 days ascended into the clouds (from Earth to Heaven).  I am not condemning this film version because I know this film has helped so many people believe in God and Jesus in many countries.  But for a really in depth, detailed and very emotional account of the life of Jesus, I highly recommend,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Jesus-of-Nazareth/dp/B0000633QW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Jesus of Nazareth</a>&nbsp;(1977).
1 ||| Slavishly faithful to the Gospel of Luke, this by-the-numbers retelling of Jesus's life never develops dramatic momentum.  As cinema, it's just plain dull; the photography is washed-out (as it was even when the film was new), the zoom lens is overused, and the special effects, minimal as they are, get really cheesy.  Everything is exposition, and it's not terribly competent exposition at that. Some continuity gaffes create unintentional hilarity.  For example, when Jesus dips his head in the water for a total-immersion baptism, his hair never seems to get wet.  (This is a miracle we haven't read about, folks.) Extras are fun, including a short documentary about the Jesus Film Project, which carts this particular film all around the world as an evangelical tool.  Especially surreal is an hour-long compendium of pious testimonials from such luminaries as George Bush XLI and David Copperfield (huh?). The soft but adequate full-frame transfer on this DVD doesn't leave out any significant information -- I suspect the film was shot open matte.  But many of the compositions are so inept that you'll swear they were cropped at the sides anyway. Catholics beware: This film presents a very Protestant-American Jesus, with its emphasis on a "personal relationship with God" and other faith concepts that Mother Church could find potentially heretical.  That's no surprise, though, considering that the film was financed by the leader of Campus Crusade for Christ.
3 ||| Before I begin my review, I must state something: Having Been translated into over 700 languages, this film has been seen by more than 4 Billion people since its release in 1979 (over 60 Million who saw it have dedicated their lives to the blessed Savior). THE REVIEW This is a really good film. It has the power to truly change lives. Brian Deacon shines as Jesus. The things that detract from the film are mediocre acting by most of the supporting cast and some choppy editing. Other than this, a truly mesmerizing movie experience. But the best film version of the Gospels is the 2000 Miniseries version starring Jeremy Sisto (I also here that Mel Gibson's film "The Passion" is really good, but I won't decide until I see it this Easter). Note: This is the 120 Minute Version. I own (and prefer) the 83 Minute Version of the film. Grade: B+
2 ||| Very accurate telling of the Gospel according to Luke.  What concerns me about this movie is the portrayal of Jesus.  Like most movies of the life of Jesus, our Lord and Savior is portrayed in very somber terms, almost inhuman in a way. In real life, Jesus was one of us.  He was part man, part God.  Without sin, but fully enjoying of his time on this Earth But the story line was execptionally accurate (unlike most tellings of the Gospel) and if you can deal with a Jesus character who seems removed from his surroundings, then this movie will be a great buy for you.
3 ||| This Jesus film is true to the Gospel of Luke.  That is good and bad.  It sticks very close to the Gospel of Luke and avoids the Hollywood straying which most Jesus films undertake.  However, because it is so closely tied to Luke, there is no crown of thorns on the head of Jesus (which is not mentioned in Luke).  Because I am a stickler for accuracy, I think this is the best Jesus film available, even without the crown of thorns.
2 ||| This movie, made by the Genesis Project and was released  in theaters nationwide in the early 80's, is unfornuately, boring.  The directing is of novice caliber and the acting very forgetful.  Based on the Gospel of Luke, it fails to give an emotional impact.  I know they wanted to make a great film, but instead, they made an uninspiring account of the life of Christ. This movie has been hailed by so many layity and pastors as a great witnessing tool.  If this is true, then the movie accomplished something good, however, I find it hard to believe anyone can set through it without falling asleep.  Read the Gospel of Luke instead. Watch Jesus of Nazareth if you must watch a gospel movie.  This movie, however, is better than King of Kings and is on equal footing as The Greatest Story Ever Told in enterianment value.
3 ||| The stories of Jesus' conception and birth are recorded in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. This movie is based on Luke's account. The story begins with a prologue to summarize Jesus' life as a child and to bring the story into focus. John Heyman researched this film for five years and then filmed it in over 200 locations in the Holy Land.  Over one billion people have viewed this work and it has been translated into more than 425 languages and shown in more than 225 countries. The Epic story of the most controversial life in human history could barely be covered in one movie, so this is more of an overview of Jesus' life.  In 83 minutes, this story will make you want to know more about a man who walked the earth, knowing he would die to give man the ultimate gift - Eternal Life. Throughout the movie, Jesus speaks in parables to teach his followers truth. He calls his disciples and empowers them to convey God's messages to a wider audience.  Jesus' Miracles in this movie included the Feeding of the 5,000, Calming the Storm, Raising Jairus' Daughter, and giving site to the blind. The Last Supper is portrayed and then the Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus starts to make this movie more dramatic. This movie very briefly touches on all the trials and then draws you into the emotional aspects of Jesus' Crucifixion. When he triumphs over death and is raised from the dead he appears in bodily form to show that he is indeed alive.  The story ends with Jesus ascending into the clouds [....]  I recommend this movie to all who want to know how to leave this world alive. This movie left me with a feeling of love for Jesus Christ, who gave his life for us so we can spend an eternity in heaven with our Creator, God.  ~The Rebecca Review
1 ||| While it is mostly Biblically accurate, nevertheless this is a very lackluster re-telling, being obviously low-budget. The most dramatic and emotional scene for me was when Mary Magdalene's tears fell on Jesus's feet and she wiped them with her hair. The scourging scene lacked any impact, probably not to horrify the audience. According to evidence from the Holy Shroud of Turin and the witness of several Catholic mystics, His scourging was absolutely heart-rending in its horror. Of course, this being an obvious Protestant production, they gave short shrift to Jesus's mother, Mary! Maybe that is why they chose Luke, instead of using material from Matthew, Mark or John!!! I guess what I am looking for is a good Catholic rendering. Any good Catholic out there have about $100,000,000 (or possibly less), as I am ready to do it right!!!
0 ||| This is so lame! The songs are terrible! The villan is a ripoff of Mr. Burns from The Simpsons while the kids look like they're on loan from a Charlie Brown show. But the biggest lowpoint is the Politically Correct ranting! Too bad CBS insists on running this back-to-back with the 1969 classic.
1 ||| "Frosty Returns" is the epitome of why classics from the 60s and 70s need not be remade.  Although Jonathan Winters does a respectable job as narrator, the story suffers from "politically correct" environmentalism and de-Christianization of Christmas.  None of it was necessary and detracts the story. Furthermore, there is no artistic continuity with the original "Frosty".  None of the characters are depicted in their original form and the computer-aided animation doesn't really add anything, either. I was disappointed that this episode was included with the Frosty DVD.  The true and worthy sequel to the original Frosty is "Frosty's Winter Wonderland".  Watch that instead as it is MUCH better than this one.
3 ||| As long as you know BEFORE you buy it that "Frosty Returns" is not the sequel to "Frosty the Snowman", you can see it without complaint. It is a different story, and has nothing to do with the original Frosty TV Special. First of all it is made by a different studio, with different animators, directors, and voices. The director is Bill Melendez, who directed all of the Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Peanuts specials, so it looks like a Peanuts cartoon. Made in 1992. The voice acting features Jonathon Winters, and it has John Goodman as Frosty. The songs are original and pretty fun. The plot is centered on the folks in town that want clean streets in winter by getting all the snow removed. The kids and Frosty are in a panic and fight back or else they will lose all their snow fun - and snow men. If you approach this show knowing it is not the sequel and is from the team that made the Peanuts shows, you will be OK.  IF YOU ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE REAL SEQUEL: The studio that made the first hour long Frosty special that first aired on CBS television in 1969 is Rankin/Bass Productions, the kings of holiday specials. That show was based on the original song written in 1951 by Steve nelson and Jack Rollins. The studio made a terrific half hour sequel in 1976 for ABC television titled "Frosty's Winter Wonderland".  That special starts right where the first one left off.  The basic premise of the story is that Frosty gets a wife named Crystal (played by Shelley Winters), and is sabotaged by the jealous Jack Frost. The character design was by Paul Coker Jr., who did the same work for the first special, so the visual continuity works very well and the characters have that classic Rankin/Bass 'look'. He also did the unique lettering for the credits in both specials. The famous voice actor Paul Frees stars as Jack Frost, and the policeman. Frees was a regular in studio productions and had also voiced the policeman, ticket seller, and Santa Claus in the original. Jackie Vernon voiced Frosty just like he did before. The writer for both Rankin/Bass shows was Romeo Muller, and Maury Laws returned as the musical director. Interestingly, while Rankin/Bassis known for the high quality of their original songs, they used Christmas standards in their sequel.  The major change in the sequel from the original is a big one, the narrator, and it can be unsettling if you watch them back to back.  While the first show was narrated and sung by Jimmy Durante, the second time we had the voice talents of Andy Griffith. Nothing against Andy, but it is a big change.  AND ANOTHER SEQUEL: Another sequel of sorts was made by Rankin/Bass with the same production team, it is a theatrical feature length movie released in 1979 titled "Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July".
3 ||| An oldie but goodie.  This is one of the Christmas classics that I have to watch every year and it's nice to own it so I can watch it when I want to instead of having to depend on national television channel.
3 ||| I bought this to watch with family near christmas. I love the animation, characters, and story.  Gotta love the christmas classic animations and now I have it for good.
3 ||| great classic
3 ||| Great price and good quality DVD. Enjoyed watching this movie, another favorite for the Holiday list.
3 ||| Real cute movie.
3 ||| I was recently sent a set of Christmas specials in exchange for review, most of which I had never seen before.  One of them was the stop motion classic Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town.  Nope, I'd never even heard of it before, but I found it pretty fun.  As the special opens, we run into a mail man (voiced by Fred Astaire) who is delivering letters to Santa.  He decides to tell us all about Santa.  It starts many years ago when a baby was left in the care of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (Paul Frees).  Being the mean guy that he is, Burgermeister throws the baby out.  But he winds up in the care of a family of elves named Kringle who happen to be toy makers.  The baby grows into a man named Kris (Mickey Rooney) who decides to deliver the toys that his family makes to share the joy with kids everywhere.  But when he returns to his home village, he finds that the Burgermeister Meisterburger has outlawed all toys.  As a result of defying the ban, Kris becomes a wanted fugitive.  Can he find a way to bring joy to the kids of the village?  And what about the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn) who lives between the Kringles and the village?  To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this special, and I'm not quite sure why.  Maybe my low expectations were why this one surprised me so much.  I actually got quite caught up in the story even though I had most of it figured out early.  The characters were so great, too, from Kris to his adopted family and his love interest Jessica (Robie Lester) on the good side to the villain you love to hate, Burgermeister Meisterburger.  I'm not a big fan of stop motion animation.  It looks too jerky to me most of the time.  That was certainly the case here, but I actually found it charming.  Maybe I'm softening in my old age.  One drawback to this short is the music.  Outside of the title song (which Fred Astaire sings so well), all the songs were unfamiliar to me.  Frankly, they didn't add much.  In fact, I found myself wanting to fast forward through them to get back to the story.  Not helping at all was how dated the musical segments were.  This special was released in 1970, and it shows.  I got a definite flower power vibe off the animation during the songs.  There were a couple of other times I felt a bit of that crept into the story.  You might also describe it as psychedelic.  My roommate found this aspect even more annoying than I did; I was mostly able to ignore it and get lost in the story again when it was over.  Kids, the target audience, won't notice how dated this is.  In fact, they'll find the 50 minutes over all too quickly.  Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town, and he's doing it with plenty of charm to entertain for years to come.
3 ||| good cartoon  about christmas
2 ||| santa'd out
3 ||| Good for a VHS.
0 ||| no review
2 ||| I like how it explains how all the Christmas traditions came together, but this was not the greatest Christmas special in my childhood. I never thought it was bad, I just did not like the idea of Burgermeister Meisterburger outlawing toys.because of my love for toys, I didn't quite like the idea of it, sort of my same issue with "Toy Story." But it is still a good special.
2 ||| I wasn't so thrilled with this show as a kid and I guess I'm still not.  It lacks the excitement and warmth of some of the other Rankin Bass shows from the 60s.  It's Ok though.
3 ||| I could never remember what the title of this show was growing up although I always loved it.  Would have been more meaningful to call it the santa story or something.  All the questions of the santa story a answered here.
3 ||| I love how all of these Rankin/Bass classics from the 60s and 70s get classic old Hollywood and Broadway stars to provide voice talents; lends a certain seriousness to the occasion.  Here we have Fred Astaire narrating and singing a couple of songs in this 1970 stop-motion retelling of the origins of Santa Claus.  Fred's a mailman delivering letters from kids to Santa, and he stops to answer some questions in the charming opening credits sequence which quotes most of the musical themes from the 50 minute TV special, first broadcast when I was 5.  Santa was an orphan left on the doorstep of the mean Burgermeister Meisterburger (I still love that name) in Sombretown (ok that's a little corny) with merely the word "Claus" on a chain around his neck.  The Burgermeister is a mean old dude and doesn't want him, and through mysterious, fortuitous circumstances he ends up with the Kringle elves in the Mountains of the Whispering Winds.  He grows up learning to make toys, befriends all the animals of the forest, and goes back to Sombretown to give toys to the kids - but is met by the Burgermeister's opposition.  Along the way the reasons for the red suit, the flying reindeer, the belly laugh, etc, are all explained, with the voices of kids breaking into Astaire's narration at times to ask him to verify that this was, in fact, how it happened.  Kinda cool even for this adult.  This was along with RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER my favorite holiday special as a kid, though it has faded for me somewhat over the years; I guess I remember the romance between Santa and schoolteacher Jessica (Mrs Claus eventually, of course) as more mawkish and sappy than it was, and I'd forgotten that the fairly dreadful "My World is Beginning Today" is full of cool 60s hippie/flower people imagery.  The early parts of the story are really fairly dark and bleak, and it's interesting that, though the Burgermeister has a moment where he harks back to childhood, he never reforms and we leave him still villainous, like Potter in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  The story - original to this film I think - seems a bit influenced by L. Frank Baum's "The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus" in the pagan/natural nature of Santa as we see him early on; but at the end a specifically Christian element enters the picture.  Apart from the love song I already mentioned, the rest of the music is pretty good, with "Put One Foot In Front of the Other" probably the most memorable; it still gives me a lump in my throat.  In addition to Astaire, the voice talents include Keenan Wynn as Winter, the magician who rules the mountains and tries to stop Claus but is quickly befriended by him; professional voice actor Paul Frees as the Burgermeister and others; and Mickey Rooney as Kringle/Santa Claus, a role he would repeat in THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS.  All are very solid, especially Wynn, an underrated actor and a great vocal talent.  Overall this was definitely more fun than I remembered it from my last viewing, probably a decade ago - though RUDOLPH I suspect will always rule my inner child's heart.
3 ||| This is an enjoyable telling of how Santa Claus became who he is today. Keep in mind that this story is completely fabricated by the minds of Rankin/Bass, not the real history of how the myth of Santa Claus evolved. With that in mind, it is quite inventive.  Where did he get his red suit? Why does he go down the Chimney? What about his reindeer and his "Ho Ho Ho"?  These questions and others are all answered as a young boy grows to manhood while a despotic mayor forbids toys of every kind in his town.  It's not quite the same storytelling level as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, but it is done well enough.
2 ||| I loved this as a kid.  So I figured I'd get it for my kids.  And they liked it too, despite the hilariously hokey special effects (hokey to them), so that's why I gave it 3 stars.  But for me, for all the christmas specials, this is the worst.  I couldn't believe the "Sit on my lap" song.  Really. Some strange creep comes to town and trades kisses and lap sitting for toys - he should have been arrested for that alone.  And then the way they tied everything to the song was really irritating.  Plus, why did the young man have an old man's voice? Annoying.
2 ||| The kids don't know who the characters are, but what the heck...they love it.  Maybe, just maybe some kid will want to see some other work of these guys.
3 ||| I just concluded my church small group using this video/book and both my class members and myself thought this was very well done.  I advised my group of the quirkiness based on other Amazon reviews, but that didn't dampen my group's response to the videos.  Each of us thought they were well done and very infomrative.  We all agreed some were better presented than others, videos number 2 and 6 stand out as being quite exceptional, but overall every one of the segments had merit.  The viewer must get used to the format.  Each videos starts out with the host appearing soewhere in the holy land.  Then they transition to a biblical scholar based somewhere in the US.  The host only appears for a couple of minutes at the start of each lesson then plasy no further role.  Once we break away from the host, theme music runs again as if we're beginning something new.  After the second set of theme music the video will cite the Biblical reference then transition to the presenter.  While this all seems a bit odd, it really doesn't detract from the overall presentation.  I recommend this for any Bible study class.  My church offered this as an adult education opportunity but now I've learned it is considering other uses.  I do believe this has many options for general church education.  Once my class ended, people were left wanting more.  Since there are many more parables to consider, perhaps a volume two will be forthcoming.
0 ||| Great series
0 ||| I so regret buying this movie. Why is it called Arthur's Perfect Christmas? The kids spend very little time on Christmas and more time trying to convince us that there are other religions just as worth while. Avoid at all costs!
3 ||| Grandkids love Arthur. And Christmas. So this was  a natural to order.
3 ||| Good for children just learning to read.
0 ||| I have been watching Arthur for 16 years. Started when my child was a toddler. I still watch it but this movie was not so great. The voices of the characters were not the same as the t.v. show and the songs were blah. I will continue watching the show but never this movie
3 ||| Like

3 ||| The grandkids likes it
3 ||| It was fun to watch, reminds me of my childhood everytime I watch arthur
0 ||| They speak rudely to each other.  Not something I want my children to learn.
3 ||| Good
3 ||| My 7 year old granddaughter loved this. It's entertaining enough for adults to watch it with the kids. Lots of music and good humor.
0 ||| We were disappointed.  Normally we love the Arthur movies...but the title to this one was off base.  Should have been called Stressful Winter Celebrations and how to make them all blend.  If it's a Christmas movie, then stick to the topic.  Let us know more about those traditions and customs.  Sounded more like "let's just not make Christmas that big a deal", was the theme.  Would love to have heard more about what the spirit of Christmas is really all about.  Why do we celebrate it?  That's what really makes it perfect.  (This was more about being politically correct.  Downplay Christmas and pull in all the other holidays)  I'm a retired teacher and I always enjoyed teaching about all of the winter holidays.  But each one got it's own presentation....including Christmas.
3 ||| I watched this with my 5yrs old daughter and she was very happy and noticed other holiday traditions!
0 ||| no substance, waters down the true meaning of Christmas-Actually spends more time explaining the Jewish Holiday than the Christian Holiday.  And then there's a moment with a character and his mother where they don't really know why their celebrating Christmas and decide to make up their own Holiday.
2 ||| Granddaughter watched it, but unlike other movies that she really likes, does not care to watch it again.
3 ||| Pretty cute.  Good message.  Grandkids liked it.
0 ||| Not a fan and I thought I would like this.  The younger sister character was awful in this and I also wasn't impressed with the commercialism represented.  I wouldn't bother with this one and wish I hadn't.
3 ||| I love Christmas specials and try to watch all of them I can. This was great one for younger children or those of us who are young at heart!
3 ||| My seven year old grandson is really into SpongeBob, Sam and Cat, and Rabbit Invasion so I was shocked when this was the Christmas video he wanted to watch.  He thoroughly enjoyed it as did I.
3 ||| My 3-1/2-year-old granddaughter loves Arthur!  This is a typical Arthur movie and she enjoys them all!!!  Since Christmas is coming up soon, she particularly enjoyed this one.
3 ||| I think we originally saw this on the TV one Christmas years ago. Our cable provider listed out Holiday shows in the Kids Section during the Season and I found it one year so I got the family together and we watched it. I ended up purchasing it on DVD since it wasn't on the following Christmas and I didn't have Prime at that time. Anyway, on to the review ...  The show has a couple musical numbers in it which is not a normal feature of the kid's series. They're cute and provide a nice touch. The usual cast of characters are there and we learn a little more about each of them and what they do during their own Holiday celebrations. Every Holiday is covered which has become the norm for many Christmas shows; making sure no one feels left out. As such, you'll learn a little bit about each of those Holidays throughout the vignette of the storyline. Sadly, they keep Christmas focused on the commercial end of it and do not touch upon the sacred core about Christ's birth. But, that isn't distracting or forced, it just is. Arthur's dad does insert a nod to Biblical times when he decides to ditch the usual turkey and taters for first century foods. Neither are the other Holiday celebrations forced into the storyline. They flow naturally and overall the whole show highlights themes such sacrifice, friendship, love, togetherness, etc.  Marc Brown's characters are true-to-life in that he does a fine job having them mirror how kids act in the real world. As such, their reactions provide lots of opportunities to talk to your kids about what is happening during the show. At least, that's how we watch shows. : )  Final analysis, enjoyable Holiday fare; fun for the whole family.
3 ||| My little one has always enjoyed watching Arthur. So when he came across Arthur's Perfect Christmas, he had to watch it. I really enjoy, that I am able to watch my Amazon Prime shows on my iPad.
3 ||| Bought this for my daughter and she really likes it, she saw it prior to purchase so new it would be a hit
3 ||| I choose this rating because it's "Authur" a very wholesome cartoon for this generation of children.  The only reason as to why it did not receive 5 stars was because the voices are different...I'm not one for changing character voices although I realize Authur can't stay eight years old forever.  I just like the focus being in the everyday life of a little boy who's dealing with growing pains lol.  I would recommend it however don't depend on the episode to put you in the Christmas spirit alone... :)
2 ||| Looking for something to watch with the kids (3 & 7), threw a dart at the free "Amazon Prime Kids' Videos" and watched this.  It is reasonably enjoyable but not much more.  There are quite a few story lines going on at once (Buster's mom and her emotional issues at Christmas, Arthur's search for the perfect Christmas present for mom, DW's anxiety over whether or not she'll get what she really wants from Santa, etc) so it isn't really focused enough to command much of an identity.  It's hard to capture much magic with a few too many varied story lines shifting back and forth.  My biggest complaint is the very forced multicultural element - not surprising since this is a PBS program, but it felt too educational & preachy in its covering of all the faith bases.  I'd prefer they make some unique holiday shows about Hanukkah and Kwanza instead of forcing the politically correct gamut at the expense of a more engaging story. I imagine if your kids are fans of Arthur they'll enjoy this one just fine.  There's nothing especially wrong with it, but there's also nothing especially memorable about it either.  Worth a rental at best.
1 ||| My kids are young (under the age of 4) and couldn't get into this. Plus I don't enjoy movies about Christmas when they're really about being politically correct.
3 ||| I'm a fourteen year old guy and I still love this show as does my older brother who is nineteen. The jokes in the tv episodes go way over some kids heads and even over some adult's and when you catch them you wanna pee your pants. In this movie its less of the adult jokes, more random funny stuff. You have to love the way that in this movie (and alot of the episodes) they have a great way of ripping on toys/movies/books...Its awesome. With how cheap you can get this I would have to say...Watch the show first then go for it.
1 ||| The DVD was blank, unfortunately.
2 ||| Really had high hopes after reading reviews for this; however, I have not seen an improvement after using for a few months. Giving 3 stars since things are not getting worse either. I do plan to continue to use this DVD since I am not seeing any worsening symptoms even though I remain very active and lift and carry my 3 year old who weighs 33 lbs.
2 ||| Ok but not easy to follow , haven't noticed a big difference
2 ||| could have been more to it
3 ||| Liked the program.
3 ||| very important exercises are presented here. not just kegel but other such as squats. i think in general these are great to do on a regular basis.
2 ||| still not into this after watching once! Just do Kagels when I think of it! Am 57, started symptoms at menopause! Don't understand WHY! Only had ONE child, C section! Carried low the whole time and could never go to bathroom! Still, am 4 11" always small! Weight yo yo All my life 90/110! Gained 50 POUNDS WHEN PREGNANT, MOSTLY WATER, GD DURING PREGNANCY SO ON STRICT DIET! I think what caused problems/RUNNING FOR YEARS, WEIGHTS WHILE EXERCISING! I recommend all women wear a support belt while pregnant! No ONE EVER TOLD ME THIS COULD HAPPEN TO OUR BODY! So when Dr. Said I had this I was shocked! So FAR refused Surgery! What has helped is two green drinks EVERY DAY! Plus 3 FIBER MATE TABLETS! Use a bench for feet in bathroom! Never let myself get constipated! Breath to go to bathroom/NO FORCE! Never thought I would write this but I hate reading What has happened to hundreds of women who had surgery! Would Never have! Also, use bio hormones! Afraid of estrogen cream but use occasionally! Don't want Cancer! NO RUNNING! NO WEIGHTS! NO HEAVY LIFTING! Walk and elyptical! Am afraid of sex but give in once in a while so husband doesn't divorce me! Need to lose ten or fifteen pounds but haven't been able to! My whole life could only lose weight running Weights and fasting! Will try this video more after reading reviews! Am still very depressed about the future of this FRIKIN NIGHTMARE! I don't leak or have pain etc. one women Doctor said DONT HAVE SURGERY, HERS IS WORSE AND SHE LIVES WITH IT! Had the flu a few days and after throwing up for days it caused severe lower back pain, bleeding! And now feels like I urinate in the wrong place! Am going to keep reading what other people do! After the mesh stories I cannot see giving in to such a nightmare! God bless ALL YOU WOMEN! Tell young women to do these exercises all there life and wear support belt when pregnant! Wish someone would have told me!  Another thought for MOMS! I carried my daughter around all the time because she didn't have DAD! She had legs rapped around my waste above my hips! Did this until probably five! Was a muscular child, not fat, but big boned and heavy frame, all muscle! I NOW think all the pressure from holding her like this a lot might have contributed big time! So "STUPID" THAT I never thought holding her would hurt me! God bless you all! Sincerely
3 ||| If you leak urine it might help you - I did not have that problem though and I returned it.
2 ||| Well, these exercises were helpful. I have found others that I like and are more portable if that means anything.
3 ||| I bought this after I had my baby and had a cystocele (bladder prolapse). Tara thoroughly describes the exercises and why they help, and she's very easy to understand and listen to. However, it's not just kegels. It's also abdominal, back, and upper leg workouts, which all help more than just kegels alone. However, the workouts take a long time (the shortest one is 8 minutes, and that's AFTER you've mastered the moves first) and I just do not have time to do these with a toddler running around and my busy schedule. If I had plenty of free time or was a stay-at-home-mom, I would do these every day because I know they'd help and it has great reviews. But unfortunately I don't have the time.
2 ||| This DVD is fun. Not the best of all the Star Wars Satires I have seen, but certainly on of the few that focuses on George Lucas and his universe. Done to the tone of "Shakespeare In Love", this movie has cute moments, Star Wars inuendos and some clever diaglogue. The performances are very good too. It's cute. For the Die Hard - Star Wars fan this is a must. Be warned, its very short!
3 ||| Ok, so I never saw "Shakespeare in Love".  After watching this 10 minute Star Wars/Shakespeare spoof, I'm not sure I want to.  I'm sure it's a fine movie, but what "George Lucas in Love" accomplished in only 10 minutes surely can't be improved over the course of a 2-hour movie (perhaps I'm also still bitter that it beat "Saving Private Ryan" for best picture of 1998.. grrrrr).  That little rant aside, Star Wars is probably the most frequently spoofed movie or cultural phenomenon of all time (with Star Trek running a close second).  This current incarnation takes its inspiration from "Shakespeare in Love" and finds a college-age George Lucas struggling to find his inspiration to write an 'agricultural space opera' for his final project.  As he walks across campus to meet with his advisor, you see many quirky schoolmates who seem to have inspired different characters and plots in Star Wars, from Han Solo to Jabba the Hutt.  Even his advisor engages in the backward speak that defines Yoda.  George finds his inspiration in the form of an attractive co-ed who's hairstyle seems vaguely familiar.  There is even a little twist that romance that I dare not mention.  This is a hilarious send up of two very successful movies and definitely worth the 9 minutes you will spend watching it.
3 ||| This was an excellent film.  Gosh, if only it could have been longer!  The commentary and the making-of pieces are equally as entertaining. The other shorts on the DVD version leave a little to be desired.  But Lucas is great!
2 ||| A co-worker, a huge "Star Wars" fan, breathlessly brought this video to work and had me borrow it. "It's so great!," he promised. Eh... My friends have made more effective nine minute movies, but  it's not hard to understand why this film sells so well -- there's an  endless supply of mythology for devotees of "Star Wars," and this  movie exposes it, if not skillfully, at least blatantly. Few of the  so-called "inspiration" shots really work well -- Obi-Wan and  Jabba work because they're more subtle. The Darth Vader and R2D2/C3PO ones  stretch for believability -- I know there's weirdos at any university at  any time, but these caricatures try a little too hard as written (if what  I'm writing doesn't make sense, it's because I'm trying to not give the  movie away). Really good filmmakers (and remember that Nussbaum is still  new at this) don't pander in such obvious ways. Still, the acting's good,  it's reasonably well-made, and there's only nine minutes of it, so you  don't have too long to dwell on shortcomings anyway. Not a bad purchase for  "Star Wars" freaks.
3 ||| Saw this orginally online and it spread like wildfire aroundthe office. Hysterical, with brilliant references and parodies. If itwas any more expensive I'd say pass but [at this price] you can't even buy a paperback. You get a few hours of fun as you play for every uninitiated person who visits your house.
3 ||| I never saw this special during my childhood, which in retrospect was really too bad. Now that I have a four year old son, I love finding "pre-Elmo" Sesame Street productions for him to watch. This is a fun special - In a nutshell, thanks to Big Bird, the Sesame Street folks find themselves locked overnight in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At this point, various characters start having their own adventures: Oscar becomes enamored with the museum's collection of ancient Greek statues, believing them to be beautiful "trash" because they are missing limbs, noses, heads, etc.; Bob is forced to thwart Cookie Monster's desire to eat a painting by Paul Cezanne and other works of art; Super Grover tries to make friends with a suit of armor, thinking that it's a real person; and Big Bird along with Mr. Snuffleupagus help a 4006 and one-half year old, cursed Egyptian boy (who presumably lives by day as a mummy in the museum) solve an ancient riddle so that he can transform into a star and live with his parents in the night sky. Admittedly, the Egyptian portion of the special is a bit odd; they continually make reference to the "demon" (played by actor James Mason) that arrives at stroke of midnight to pose the riddle's question to the Egyptian boy, as well as Osiris (the god of the underworld) who poses the final challenge to the boy's ascension. I thought this segment was great, but I never thought I would hear the word "demon" uttered by Big Bird - Maybe they should start having him call Elmo a "little red demon!" (Just Kidding). As with nearly everyone else who reviewed this special, I really wish that it was available on DVD. However, if I must purchase a used VHS copy, I will do so.
3 ||| I looked up a description of this set at Barnes and Noble.com, and as it turns out this set is just a compliation of three other sets: Elmopalooza, Do the Alphabet, and The Best of Elmo (telling me that apparently the best of Sesame Street is very Elmo-centric).  Personally I was trying to find some of those classic comedy routines I remember from when I was a kid, like Ernie calling to the fish (Here fishy fishy fishy). But I'm giving it four stars since I'm sure the material on here is perfectly good, even if I'm not personally interested.
3 ||| I wish CTV would consider reissuing "Sesame Street" as a chronological series, starting with "Season One," and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast, not with a few select bits chopped up into the new, modern mix.  The old shows were so wonderful... and that awful, whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen!
3 ||| Parents, I have not watched this tape that much but on Sesame Street Grover wants to be someone else. So all Grovers friends on Sesame Street cheer him up and show him how good he is. This is a great video for you and friends to watch.
2 ||| Parents, This is a video tape with some comic mocvies for kids in it. My 8 year old loves Cookie Monster so I try to find video tapes that inclued him. Keep in mind you will think this is fummy to.
3 ||| We've seen virtually every Sesame Street video - some once, some many times.  This one is one of the most enjoyable.  We owned it for a long time, then my kids outgrew it - or so we thought!  They've asked to see it several times since we gave away our copy, so we keep getting it out of the library.  My kids are 7 and 10 now, and still asking!  We are particularly fond of 'Telly's Lunch' and the skit with Grover.  This is one of the really good Sesame Street videos - definitely worth the $ - only wish we'd kept our copy when we had a chance!  Four stars because nothing is better than Elmo's Sing Along Guessing Game, but this is VERY close.
2 ||| Remeber Grover the Waiter and his chubby blue customer?  This video is a great chance to visit them again - Grover has "worked his way up in the food business" to become a Planet Storybook (read Hollywood) waiter and change the unhealthy eating habits of his favorite customer.  Along the way are lots of gags about storybook characters (Grover trips over Jack Be Nimble's candlestick, for instance - and the restaurant is decorated with memorobilia like Cinderella's glass slipper)  Very cute. I think I'm not cool enough to enjoy the song clips, but if you and your kids enjoy spoofs, you'll like them: "Cereal Girl,"  Cookie monster rapping about "Healthy Food," and bologna, cheese, and bread singing "Telly's Lunch" (Brady Bunch Theme) I liked "Blueberry Mouth," a Leon Redbone style (?) tune about blueberry picking. I don't know that it made any difference in eating behavior with my son, but he's a pretty good eater anyway.  He enjoyed it, though: particularly the singing broccholi.
2 ||| I bought this video at the same time as I bought "Do the Alphabet" and now my two-year old nephew won't watch it.  He only asks for "Bic Birt" (Big Bird is on the box of "Alphabet").  I've tried sneaking it into the VCR when he isn't watching in hopes he'll  get hooked, but he always asks plaintively for the other one.  Personally,  I think that they count a little fast for him while the  "Alphabet" tape goes pretty slow.  And Baby Bear is always a  winner.  I think though that he will appreciate when he gets a little  older.
2 ||| ok
3 ||| According to my daughter the grandkids really enjoy this.  Morgan a bit more she is 3.  Carter is just going on 2 in June.
1 ||| My 2 year old daughter enjoys the songs, but the snarky and rude behavior modeled by Ernie and the bellhop is a bad example for her. Sesame Street, at its best, teaches children respect and kindness towards others. That's not only absent here, but what is shown is the opposite of how I would like my child to behave.
2 ||| This is a cute video with some catchy tunes ("one, two three, count with me, we'll count everything around us that we do and hear and see!"). It's not old enough to appeal to parents like me who like Sesame Street nostalgia and want to introduce their kids to the genius of Jim Henson. (Ernie, in particular, is without his characteristic mischief.) But, it's not new enough to be instantly recognizable to the kids of today. I'll put this video on without complaint when my daughter asks for it (she does like it) but it's not one of the first ones I reach for. I like the Count's "Count It Higher" much better.
3 ||| Our two-and-a-half year old really got into this, but didn't like "learning about numbers" at all, except for one little sequence that show 2 girls playing with a dollhouse. the two dvds are actually quite different: this one features elmo and ernie and feels very much geared toward children while "learning about numbers" actually seems like they were trying to entertain children and adults at the same time by adopting a mock talk show format where big bird is supposed to be some kind of jay leno standup. plus there is a lot of "The Count" in that LAN, and our toddler didn't like him at all!  Much better choice, I think, for toddlers. Only weakness is that they give short shrift or even skip over certain numbers between 1-20. Some kind of brainless editing decision by somebody who didn't get enought sleep, no doubt.
3 ||| You have to love Sesame Street-they consistently produce material that is child-friendly and educational.  The songs are catchy and it is a great tool for teaching numbers.  I did not give the video five stars because I think Benny is annoying, but that is just my opinion.
2 ||| This one has some decent material, but it takes too long to get to it. It begins with Ernie finding a room key from the Furry Arms Hotel and he proceeds there to return it. Once there, he engages in some banter with Benny the Bunny, the hotel owner and some hotel staff. This goes on for several minutes and becomes tedious before some short Sesame Street segments are able to offer a brief respite. Some of these are good, though the song with three blackbirds is not very good and lasts too long. Also, the MC Elmo song about the Number Five is also on The Best of Elmo DVD; so, if you are looking for exclusive Elmo material for your child, this is not your best bet. Now, I like Ernie as much as the next person, but I'm not certain what they were thinking when they decided to feature so much interaction with other, practically unknown characters. He ends up dinging the bellhop bell fifteen times, which is way too repetitious for even the youngest viewer. Overall, this isn't terrible, but it is far from the best Sesame Street has to offer.
3 ||| Educational DVDs should be cheaper (at least USD 6.00) & it'll help all education-concious parents to buy them. Besides, their DVD running time is approximately 40 minutes. My 12-month-old niece is into cartoon in the first place. My sister-in-law's mistake. Cartoon offers her entertainment. And my wife told her younger sister that Sesame Street DVD can be a good tool for babies/kids to learn & promised her it'll be a birthday gift for her daughter. Sadly, we can't find any Sesame Street DVD in Malaysia & if there is any, the price will be around RM 80 (USD 20.00). That's when I logged on to Amazon.com & purchased it. Now she has gradually developed big interest in watching the DVD. The only dissatisfaction I have is that the captioning doesn't appear (only the subtitle appears). The captioning is good for impaired-hearing people & kids to learn about reference to situation (eg. "chattering", "laughing"). I've bought few DVDs from Amazon before (eg. American Me) & the captioning appears as just fine on my region-all DVD player. Regards, Irwan Shah from Malaysia.
2 ||| My daughter is 19 months old and loves Sesame Street. But we were disappointed that she didn't like this DVD. She found the rabbit/bellhop character annoying and a little scary. He's kind of ugly and mean, and unfortunately he's the main character after Ernie. And her favorite character, Elmo, is only in one vignette. It was also too slow to hold her attention without more of her favorites like Elmo or Cookie Monster in it. She's learning to count just great without it anyway, so we'll probably just give it to someone else.
2 ||| This dvd does not keep my son's attention as well as other dvds out there (Baby Einstein, Richard Scary), but he does love the musical numbers & will dance with them. Obviously, the educational value is high, but I would have expected better from Sesame Street.
2 ||| I have to say I had higher hopes for this video; Sesame Street has such a wonderful stable of number clips, and I was hoping to see better ones. So, for the first time, I'm recommending the between-clip footage over the clips!  The opening song "That's How The Numbers Go" could easily become the numerical version of the ABC song; its jazzy and singable and goes all the way to twenty.  The setup is that Ernie stops by the Furry Arms Hotel to return a lost room key, where he shows bumbling hotel owners Humphrey and Ingrid that things (like room keys) can be organized with numbers.  I also like that this video isn't scrubbed clean of any conflict - the much-maligned bellhop, Benny the Bunny, is one of Kevin Clash's best characters, and he's terrific in this video; he and Ernie show how to return a sour face with a smile (and some innocent teasing!) Although there is one good clip - "Martian Beauty #9," unfortunately, this doesn't include some of the ingenious and artistic number clips from Sesame Street past:  no bakers falling down stairs, no pinball machine, no counting marble machines.  Instead, you get the lukewarm "#11 rap," which shows pictures of 11 things, and "Five Jive with Elmo Hammer," which is already on too many Sesame Street videos as it is.  Yawn.
3 ||| We love this DVD.  My son enjoys and asks for it frequently.  Highly recommend...my son loves to count things now! HOWEVER, I do have just one small complaint.  The "chapters" are not clean...if you go to the chapter on the number 3 you get the tail end of 2; chapter 5 closes with the beginning of the next number.  This is annoying...especially when you want to go to a number and you have to sit thru the end of the previous chapter and all the while La Petite Prince is chanting 3 3 3 3 3 3 3. I have noticed that the SS DVD's (like Follow that Bird for example) don't have logical clean chapters....why?  It doesn't seem like rocket science to me...
3 ||| My 14-month old daughter has watched this several dozen times already, and she still picks this one out when given a choice between this or another Sesame Street video. She loves Ernie and Elmo, both of whom appear regularly in the show, and while she still isn't saying her numbers, I'm pretty sure she's getting the concepts figured out. I also make sure to interact with her to help reinforce the concepts and help keep her focused. Even though I've watched it with her for at least half of those viewings, I generally enjoy watching it with her. Part of the reason is the different segments are well-done and actually have the occassional bit of adult humor (e.g., the "counting crows" who sing about 3 -- supposedly the source for the band's name), and also for the things that happen in the background as Ernie interacts with Benny and the Dinger (for instance, when Ernie dings the Dinger for the first time, watch the action in the background -- it's quite funny, and definitely targeted for the adults who are watching along!).
3 ||| My four-year old son just asked if he could watch this for the 3rd time in a row this evening. The little story line (Ernie is learning the routine in the Furry Arms, the local hotel) is entertaining for little kids-- as are the characters. Some are over-the-top, but with little kids, they *have* to be so the kids recognizee they're obnoxious. For kids who avoid counting, this is a good way to sneak it in. They don't realize it's "good for them"!
1 ||| Part 1 of this DVD is crammed with standard shred licks...but not much in the way of how, when and where to use them. In that respect, it's one of the more disorganized guitar instructional videos I've seen. Despite Paul's youth and enthusiasm,, the material gets relatively advanced rather quickly (and he can play the licks so fast and perfect, it's just as discouraging as inspirational).  In Part 2, he sporadically mentions things that would be aimed at relative beginners...which definitely doesn't belong on these videos.  On the other hand, Example #7 is so much more intricate/difficult than anything else on this disk, it seems out of place.  The best thing on the whole disk are the 2-note per string/string skipping arpeggios (wish I woulda started practicing those 10 years ago). There are a couple of other cool licks, but the video ends up a mess of a lot of talking...my mind wandered.  Before attempting to play along, you should already know all the major scale modes and the melodic minor scale.  Your alternate picking should already be very controlled/synchronized and you should be experienced with string skipping.  It also contains some extreme finger stretches/intervals that a lot of people might never be able to do (a shorter scale neck or extraordinary long fingers will come in handy here).  If you don't already have the skills mentioned above, I highly recommend Don Latarski's "Guitar Theory Basics" and Frank Gambale's "Chopbuilder" be bought first.  Sequentially, they'll introduce you to all the basic mode fingerings and get your alternate picking, control and speed somewhat closer to Paul's level.
1 ||| The title on this exercise DVD does not really match the actual content. "Yoga-Lite for Biblical Worship after Childbirth" may be a better title.  Tonya leads a gentle, soft yoga practice (not powerful as in the title) geared towards intermediate practitioners. There is not a lot of sculpting performed in the practice, although her Yoga routine can provide some toning. She provides very little instruction or beginner options so I would not recommend it if you're looking for a beginner's stretching routine. For instance, during Chaturanga (slow downward movement plank), she does not give the option to lower your knees first, then goes into the full upward dog position. She does bridge pose (an advanced yoga posture) with very little instruction and poor form.  Also, if you're looking for a non-demoninational practice, this is not the DVD for you. She talks specifically about God, Jesus, and Repenting and includes quotes from the bible during what's called the "Spritual Warm-Up", which assumes all spiritual practitioners believe in God and follow the Bible. It felt more like a sermon/lecture to me. This turned me off, specifically since it's marketed as a regular "stretching" video.  The practice is somewhat weak, Tonya's voice is too soft and she does not provide clear enough queues so you have to look up quite often to follow her routine. Moveover, the music is too load and has church-based singing which even more overpowers her delicate voice.  The introduction video section has Tonya and her single student showing their new babies. It is commendable that they both just gave birth and have made a video. All the proceeds go to "Acres 4 Life" which helps people in Africa learn to farm their land, which is awesome! I really appreciate their efforts and work helping people with their loving kindness, but again, it would be better to be straight forward in their marketing that their efforts have religious undertones. It's not that I don't support them, but they should be clear on the cover of the DVD that the proceeds will be used for religious-based projects.

0 ||| I thought I was watching an exercise video instead she's quoting the Bible. This is garbage, if I want to read the Bible I'll do it on my own time. very deceiving
3 ||| This was a great stretch routine with elements of yoga and sculpting that was not overly difficult or strenuous. I don't know if it earns it's "Power" in the title, but it was effective, especially if you aren't feeling high-energy, but want to get in some work. There is a little Bible-reference "spiritual" warm-up at the beginning.
1 ||| Didn't realize it was post-natal
1 ||| Not for me.
1 ||| She is  OK.
2 ||| What was with all the Christian bullsh*?  I guess they don't care about including the culture that developed these stretches...  It's all yoga, and that came from Hinduism. At least don't say anything so all cultures can participate w/out feeling excluded.
3 ||| No Problem
3 ||| I fondly imagined that this would be a gentle stretch to soothing music, so was rather challenged by quite a tough workout. One thing, do have a proper mat. My knees did not do well on a towel and I had to purchase a  good mat before I could repeat the workout. Further to other reviews, the  instructor's very affected speech patterns were annoying and distracting,  but not enough to take away from the fact that I will use this tape again  and again.
3 ||| Just as I remember it when I watched it as a kid. Great nostalgia.
2 ||| I liked this movie, but it was predictable and simple. Although the plot was worn, I enjoyed most parts of the movie. The quality is decent and the movie is worth a try.
2 ||| Made on the heels of the success of Superman (1978) and not afraid to drop names, this is not quite a superhero film. It is more akin to a 007 spy film, even if at times it resembles the Pink Panther films, being filmed in several European locations and even with music by Henry Mancini. A better photographer and a better director could have done wonders with just that.  The first event in an Istanbul cafe is quite close to a Clouseau movie, but it quickly distances itself from that feel.  The film was quite ambitious for that Disney period, with lots of potentially exciting chases (which never quite get there,) we get custom spy cars & a Rolls-Royce chase, laser shooting speedboats, a sky lift escape, a helicopter and a mechanical wing contraption, which sometimes works and sometimes does not.  Oliver Reed as the villain is an absolute mess, but the two male leads (Michael Crawford and James Hampton) have a quirky relationship that brings to mind The Greatest American Hero (also 1981) down to even having a toothy lead with curly blond hair. Too bad there is no chemistry with Barbara Carrera.  While the description might superficially resemble Kick-Ass (2010), the movie features a comic book artist living out his heroic fantasies, one has really nothing to do with the other.  The animated title sequence is by Richard Williams? The DVD has no end credits.
3 ||| One of my husband's favorite movies
2 ||| For those wondering it is not as good as you remember. Era of boring kids movies from Disney.
2 ||| Was pretty good for a dated movie.
3 ||| This is a rather old movie but still fund to watch. Fun kids movie that will keep the parents watching.
0 ||| I thought I buying a copy and not paying a ten dollars for a playing of condor man.  It's a good movie but not that good.  Besides I have a copy on vhs. Sorry I messed up.  I will give it one star because of the price.
3 ||| I gave it four stars, what else is important? This whole idea that you MUST add words to a review makes me not want to bother.
3 ||| I loved this as a kid and i still manage a few laughs now. It is a pretty cheesy movie but I guess I  like a bit of cheese. I hear they are making a new movie of this and I am sure it will be action packed. The story is ok, Michael Crawfords American accent is terrible but  I just keep coming back to watch it. I did like the gagets and the disguises - funny.
0 ||| This was not a box office hit when it was first released; most critics hated it.  Time has not tempered its many flaws.  The humor is broad and at times overbearing, abrasive.  The lead character is a nitwit, obnoxiously stupid.  Oddly enough, this is the only character played for laughs, the rest are deadly serious in their intent (none more so than Oliver Reed as the villain, one of the few bright spots in an otherwise dreary enterprise).  The effect is quite jarring, as though they forgot to inform Michael Crawford that they had changed their minds, the piece was now a gritty spy thriller.  Unfortunately, it's never as funny as it should have been, and not serious enough to work on any other level.  This is not a movie I'd ever want to watch again under any circumstance.
3 ||| James Bond comic book style by Disney. Brought to life from a comic book figure the writer entangles himself by falling in love with another agent from the other side that wishes to defect shortly after they meet in an simple document exchange. Upon her choice she will only defect if the pick up and transfer is done by Condorman!!! As this is the name the writer provided when they met. It is a cool adventure through the countryside with hang gliding, a gypsies truck that turns into a race car and then a hydrofoil with awesome care and boat chases through the Italian Mountains. So Kick back and Enjoy a great movie!!!!
2 ||| I rented the film for $1.99 because I found the sale price way too high.  It's a charming, funny, lighthearted spoof of the secret agent genre.  I'm a big Michael Crawford fan and this is the only work available where he's not lost in the character like Forum or Dolly. I wish he'd done more film work post-Phantom of the Opera. He has a true gift for comedy.
2 ||| This movie is OK for $5, but not for $20. This movie does not have  the exceptional-Disney charm of excellent Disney-movies like, "Swiss Family Robinson", "Summer Magic", "That Darn Cat old-version", or good Disney movies like "Toby Tyler".  If you are rich or can find it for $5; it holds your attention, a little humor, but not exceptional humor, filmed on locations, some interesting gadgets but nothing you have not seen before, moves at a decent pace.  If you pay too much for this film; you will not enjoy it, because you are not buying that charm of a bygone era. This film is simply an OK film on a modern theme.  Some of the five-star-reviews are shil-reviews by sellers. I have paid a premium for other discontinued films, which were excellent, and which I did not regret paying extra to get. This is not one of them.
3 ||| I have been searching for this movie on dvd for over 10 yrs , as a lota people have. And finally I found this version , which was until recently , very rare and hard to come by. This is a pretty good quality late 1999 - 2001 dvd. Yes , I know what the title says , but that's not entirely correct. This tranfer is not super great , but it is good. Honestly , It still can be very Dusky and even a little old world blurry at times with the pops and grain clearly visible. There is no behind the scenes footage at all simply a Laser-disc like menu and the movie. Don't let that statemnet fool you , this definitly is a quality transfer for the times and not a laserdisc bootleg by any stretch. But Hopefully one day This movie will get the remastered High-def treatment it so desperatly deserves. But for old school fans like myself right now , it's just a treat to have this on dvd disc to enjoy the fun , and I think you will too.
0 ||| My other review was deleted but beware this disney dvd of condorman is not out of print and is way cheaper on the disney club i cannot write down the prices because that is why my review was probrably deleted because the sellers don't want people to know they can get this dvd cheaper.the anchor bay versions are out of print but not these ones.....you have been warned.i am going to write to disney to let them know about this and hopefully amazon can list the proper prices for everyone to buy.and not be ripped off in times of hardship otherwise great movie 5 stars for this.
3 ||| CONDORMAN was a childhood favorite of mine, and, brother, I have been waiting impatiently for a Region 1 DVD to get my mitts on. So it's about time (but now I'm cheesed with the DVD's lack of special features). I find it really hard to be objective with CONDORMAN, this film being such a cherished memory. Having seen it again very recently, I can't help but note the datedness, the laughably rendered laser beam effects, and that hokey theme song and the cheesy cartoon Condorman in the opening credits. But mostly I happen to think that the film does stand the test of time, in terms of its watchability, its humor, and its sense of wonder and adventure.  Some SPOILERS now, peppered throughout.  A conscientious comic book artist, Woody Wilkins won't put anything in his comics which his characters couldn't do in real life. As such, the movie opens in Paris with Woody gigged out in full Condorman regalia and leaping off the Eiffel Tower to test his Condorman wings. It sucks for him that the wings malfunction and he ends up diving into the Seine river. So right away you get a sense of what this cat is like: an adventurous dreamer.  Woody thinks that his friend Harry's job in the CIA is fraught with excitement and skullduggery, even as Harry insists that he's merely a file clerk. But when Harry is tasked with finding a civilian to handle a simple courier assignment in Istanbul, he taps Woody for the mission. In Istanbul Woody meets the mysterious Natalia and impresses her when, in a pretty hilarious scene, he inadvertently takes out several enemy agents.  Cut to some time later, and we finally get to the central plot. The CIA learns that a Soviet KGB operative codenamed the Bear wants to defect, but that the Bear wants only the agent known as Condorman to act as the primary facilitator. Woody is initially reluctant, but caves when he learns that the Bear is actually Natalia (who's mistaken Woody for a top agent) and that the CIA has agreed to bring his comic book designs to life. The rest of the film treats us to more globetrotting exploits, zany secret agent and superhero antics, and a whiff of romance.  So, if you're a kid at heart, CONDORMAN should be right up your alley. One of its strongest points is that it does a good job of massaging your sense of wish fulfillment. Because who hasn't daydreamed of accomplishing daring deeds, of coming out the hero and winning that girl? CONDORMAN is awesomely nerdtacular.  Michael Crawford, if you remember him at all, is more famous for stuff like HELLO, DOLLY and for playing the Phantom of the Opera on stage (for which, to give him his just due, he garnered massive props). Crawford is skinny, gangly, boasts a non-heroic voice, and isn't who you first think of when drawing up the prototypical intrepid man of action. But he's good as the comic book creator/nerd with aspirations of derring-do. This is a Disney flick, so, it's certainly wholesome enough and its sensibilities lean toward the youngsters. A  film like this can get away with a character like Woody Wilkins, a "foolish dreamer who draws comic books" who then takes on the identity of one of his creations.  It helps that Condorman has a supporting cast who mostly plays it straight, notably Oliver Reed as the sinister Russian masterspy Krakov, Barbara Carrera as the exotic femme fatale Natalia, and James Hampton who plays Woody's amiable pal and CIA contact Harry Oslo. Jean-Pierre Kalfon, the sorta scary one-eyed Russian hitman Morovich, does it over-the-top, but, really, what else can you do when you're sporting a menacing glass eye and tearing down the Yugoslavian roads in an intimidating black Porsche? And, man, watching this film again just brings back those good old days, when the Iron Curtain was still up and the U.S. and the USSR were still kicking it Cold War. The prevailing thought back then was that the Russian Bear would be a superpower forever...  CONDORMAN is loosely based on Robert Sheckley's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Game-of-X/dp/0441273084/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Game of X</a>, which I haven't read but have just now ordered online because I hear good things about it. Catering to Woody's intent that Condorman be an international crime fighter, his plan to help Natalia defect involves their navigating a circuitous route, from Yugoslavia to the Swiss Alps to a final showdown in Monte Carlo. Considering that they end up running a gauntlet of enemy operatives in all their stops, they might as well have taken a direct flight home. But where's the fun in that, right? I thought it a perfect touch that Krakov is able to anticipate Condorman and Natalia's itinerary simply by reading Woody's comic books.  When I saw this as a kid, I was totally enthralled by the James Bond-type gadgetry. Even now, I still get a kick out of watching the sluggish Gypsy conveyance transform into the sleek Condormobile and then into a hovercraft. The laser guns, however, sucketh big. Note that CONDORMAN is more a lighthearted spy thriller than a superhero caper. Woody as Condorman appears briefly in the opening sequence and then in the last act. And, as Condorman, he doesn't really indulge in hands on fighty fights but instead settles for foiling the bad guys from a distance, soaring on wings from above and then firing off missiles at them from his Condorboat. I dug the costume, though, and as an L.A. Dodger fan, I'm glad the film closes out in Dodgers stadium, even as Woody receives his next cloak & dagger assignment. I wish, though, that we'd seen something of Woody's other creations. I can't help being intrigued by the likes of Gopher Boy, Bazooka Boy, and Laser Girl. Where oh where can I get me some of those fun Zowie Comics?
3 ||| It is a great movie. I really enjoyed it. It has some humorous parts too. I think it is a movie everyone could enjoy.
3 ||| I remember watching an interview a few years back like "This is your life" with Michael Crawford, and they went through his career of TV, movies and plays etc.. and I kept waiting for them to mention Condorman, but they never did :( and they should, as it's a very underrated movie.  When I was a kid, this was one of my favorite movies. About Woody (Crawford) who is a comic book writer who's best friend Harry (Michael J Fox's father in Teen Wolf/Longest Yard (original) guy who dies) is a file clerk for a spy company, who when left in charge to send a civilian to Istanbul to deliver some spy papers, he bumbled his way into making a top KGB agent (Natalia) believe he is a top agent and she later wishes to have him help her defect to America.  Woody takes on the challenge and finds himself being chased by Natalia's boss/lover or whatever and his team of henchmen while Woody pulls out all his toys and gadgets to help aid their escape, in the fashion of Woody bringing his comic book super hero character to life.  Seeing this again many years later, I can see why it is more of a cult classic then a very popular action/adventure comedy. But, it is still a lot better then most of the **** that floods the shelves these days, and this one is very underrated as a b grade comedy.  The character of Woody reminds me of Maxwell Smart, a bumbling secret agent who doesn't always escape by skill or outsmarting the bad guys, but by unintentional luck, but gets the girl in the end. Just try to imagine Maxwell Smart wants to be Batman at the same time, and that is about what Condorman is.  A lot of humor, zany antics, car chases and star wars lasers.. all blended in for a fun ride.  Ignore anyone selling this second hand on amazon or anywhere else for over 20 bucks... they are ripping you off hard. The DVD quality is not that great, it kind of looks like it was done straight from an old VHS to DVD without bothering to clean it up. And there is no bonus features. This DVD deserves more respect then this, and I hope Disney decide to do a special edition of it someday.  Oh yeah, not to forget, the second hand sellers are selling the out of print region 1 version... the DVD is still in print in region 4 for about 10 bucks, and includes another film with it too. And don't worry about the region stuff, they play in any old computers DVD player. So I'd recommend doing the smart thing and finding the ones still in print and pay a whole heap less then these clowns prices.  and to the person who is selling it for 500 bucks, BWUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH, you have a b grade movie there, not the holey grail.
3 ||| I was in middle school when this movie came out. It was 1981 and I had saved up my pocket money to pay for the bus ride into the city and the admission for a matinee to a movie that seemed so exciting and lively to me.  I had read the book 'The Game of X' by Robert Sheckley as well as the adaptation of the movie by Heather Simon and imagined every scene in my head as I had gone through it. The movie was everything a young boy could have hoped for - a rollicking, comedic adventure with a very beautiful female Russian agent (Carrera) and a sinister KGB chief (played by Oliver Reed).  The only problem I have with this movie is the miscasting of Michael Crawford as Woody Wilkins, the cartoonist who helps out a friend of his at the CIA office in Paris. Englishman Crawford puts on the most exaggerated American accent imagineable, although admittedly he has the brilliant comedic timing necessary to pull off this role.  The CIA in France has a problem. They need a civilian to act as a courier to Istanbul. Of course Woody gets the job, but right from the start it's obvious he is taking his role just a little too seriously. By the time he arrives to meet his KGB contact in Turkey he has fully assumed the role of his cartoon creation - top CIA agent and superhero Condorman.  Barbara Carrera (who two years later would get to play a Bond girl - the very movies this one attempts to lampoon) plays KGB agent Natalia. Later, when she makes the decision to defect, the impressive Condorman comes to mind as the only CIA agent she will trust to handle her defection.  The only problem is the CIA does not have an agent with the codename Condorman.  What follows is an adventure filled race across Europe with enough gadgets to fill several Bond movies. There is some great car chases (performed by legendary French stunt driver Remy Julienne and his 16-man crew of drivers and mechanics), boat chases and along the way Crawford sports some of the most outrageous disguises in cinema history. It's all great fun and it's executed perfectly.  For high flying escapist entertainment they don't come much more downright enjoyable than this. The DVD is a disappointment with no special features to speak off except a rather slim production notes section in the inside cover booklet. It's 2 pages of notes on the making of the movie, with sections on 'The Story,' 'The Setting,' 'Gadgetry' and 'Stunts and Special Effects,' but it's all very slim pickings.  But, I've had this movie in my DVD collection for over two years and on those quiet rainy Saturday's it's a particular favorite (along with 1980s FLASH GORDON) to put in my DVD player and sit back and remember a more innocent time in my life.  Recommended for all dreamers.
2 ||| Yes, it's Condorman, vulture of the western world and superhero/spy extraordinare!  Disguised as mild-mannered comic book writer/illustrator Woody Wilkins (Michael Crawford) by day, Condorman must fight a never ending battle to save the world from the ever growing forces of evil that threaten to engulf it, while at the same time trying desperately to protect his beautiful Russian spy girlfriend Natalia (Barbara Carrera) from the clutches of the villainous Krokov (Oliver Reed)! Highlighted by a well above average cast and an exciting musical score composed by the one-and-only Henry Mancini, and loaded with tons of adventure, action and excitement..."Condorman" is certainly a very fun movie to watch and is one that can be enjoyed by anyone, no matter how young or old they may be!
3 ||| Taking Charles Dickens' 521 page novel and turning it into a film is no easy matter, but this version seems to do a good job, following the life of Pip, the poor-turned-rich-turned-poor again young man who wants to become a gentleman.  Although this version doesn't offer many radical elements from the director, it does show chaos and darkness in the seeking of fortunes and offers a look into the neurotic behaviors lurking in our lives.  These expectations may not be great, but they certainly are worth watching.
3 ||| My mother came to visit me recently and she wanted to know what movie I had for her to watch. I showed her and my aunt this movie and they were completely captivated. It is a good story especially if you are a romantic. However I was not so keen on the ending. It seemed like there should have been something more. Something more dramatic. Also at some points in the movie things got a little slow and it took patience to get past the scenes. I did think Charlotte Rampling was a perfect Miss Havisham and Justine Waddell was perfect as Estella. Ioan Gruffudd also expressed his emotions very well in each scene without being overly dramatic. This film portrays jealousy and love very well. It is a classic after all.  ~The Rebecca Review
1 ||| Great Expectations, 1999 film  A young man runs through reeds into a cemetery. When he returns home his sister scolds him for his absence. A man catches him alone and asks for a file and food. He is an escaped convict! Back at home he is told to be "grateful". Soldiers arrive for the blacksmith, they found the escaped convict and put him in irons. Joe never learned to read. [No schools for common people then.] Pip is cleaned up for a visit. He plays cards with a young girl (pretty and proud). [Does their behavior seem odd?] Pip is questioned about his visit. "Can this be true?" He returns in six days for another visit. He sees strange things in that house. When he returns he is given a large sum of money. Afterwards he gets into a fight. [What a strange household!] Pip dreams of a better life. There is conflict in the shop. Later Pip finds a body! Who did it?  Later Lawyer Jaggers tells Pip he has a fortune and will be brought up as a gentleman "with great expectations". It's a secret benefactor. Can Joe be compensated for the loss of Pip? Pip gets a new suit and goes to London. They show scenes of life in those days. [To shock the viewer?] Pip's education begins. He lodges at Bernard's Inn. He visits a coworker. He visits Jagger's home and is given a letter. He learns of the death of his sister. Pip visits Miss Haversham again. Pip meets a young lady, they go to a recital. There is a dinner, a toast creates conflict. Pip is jealous of Estella's beau. Pip is in debt, he gets 500 as a birthday present! A strange man meets Pip to tell him a secret. What will Pip do now? Pip visits Miss Haversham, there is a conversation and conflict. Then he visits Joe Gadgery. Miss Betty taught Joe to read. "Never leave documentary evidence laying around." Pip advises Abel to leave. Drummel married Estella. Jagger's housekeeper Molly has a past.  Pip returns to question Miss Haversham about Estella. He reproaches her for her past actions. There is a fire! Pip finds Auric and there is conflict. Pip tells his secret! [Who is worse off?] pip goes to the funeral. Abel talks about his lost daughter, given up for adoption. A side-wheel steamer is on the river. Another boat draws near. There is an accusation and a struggle! Two men fall into the water. Pip dives in to save a man. Abel is taken to court for trial. Pip and Wimmick visit a church. Later visits Abel on his deathbed to say goodbye. Abel's daughter is a lady now, but he never met her. Pip arrested for unpaid debts. Joe pays off the debts. Pip talks to Betty and learns surprising news. Pip returns to Miss Haversham's mansion and finds Estella living there. Is she unhappy? What will Pip do now?  I never read the book so I can't say how faithful this adaption was. The beginning dragged for nearly an hour. Maybe another writer or director would have done better? There were a lot of close-up shots as you would expect from a movie made for television. Charles Dickens's story tells how riches can make an average man into a gentleman, and no one seems to care as to the origin of these riches. Could someone who becomes wealthy through illegal or unethical means become a respected gentleman? Yes, it has happened many times. There once was a book that told about the History of the Great American Fortunes. There may be comparable books today, if they could be published.
3 ||| I agree with the previous reviewer that the preview is stupid; it's actually the first 2 mins and credits of the film.  However, I have seen the full movie several times and I think this is an outstanding version of "Great Expectations." The final scene really packed an emotional wallop for me, unlike some of the other versions. Good cast, classy production.
2 ||| I know many people seem to love this WGBH, Masterpiece Theatre 1999 production of Charles Dickens' novel "Great Expectations." However, I did not greatly enjoy this adaptation as many people have.  My reasons:  - The picture quality is not much better than the 1981 version. Therefore, my eyes are just as content to watch the 1981 version, which develops the characters much better (even if it drags on at times.)  - This production does not develop Orick's character, or Estella's character early in the production. In fact, Mr. Pumblechook and other characters are also not as developed as I would have wished.  - Dickens' novel drags on in the middle. This production greatly contracts the plot in the central half of the novel. For example, Bentley Drummel and Matthew Pocket's characters are not developed very well in the middle part of this work. Matthew's father is nearly eliminated.  - This words spoken in this production have been updated from the 1981 adaptation and the novel. In fact, the 1974 adaptation is more accurate than this 1999 production as pertains to including famous quotes from the novel.  One positive of this adaptation is that the mood (the psychology) of this adaptation is better than the 1981 version or any other version I have seen. A second positive is that the acting is this production is just as good as the 1981 adaptation.  In summary: I prefer the 1981 version best (even though I would only give it a 4 star). However, this production is better than the 1974 Michael York/Sarah Miles adaptation, which completely eliminates the character of Orlick.  For people who want a film to watch for pleasure (rather than to prepare for a major content examination), this adaptation may be the most interesting and best choice. Otherwise, I would recommend the much longer 1981 adaptation.
2 ||| This latest version of Dickens' sprawling novel of love, jealousy, betrayal, and redemption is a faithful (or as much as possible, even in a 3-hr production) rendering.  It is well cast, with Ioan Gruffudd as the most handsome Pip on film, and Charlotte Rampling giving her usual regal performance as Miss Havisham.  Production design is good, with grim revisionist views of 18th century London typical of modern adaptations.  Photography is first rate.  What is unacceptable is that the DVD is, apparently, recorded straight off the PBS broadcast -- just as if you recorded it yourself -- complete with all the ads for Mobil, lugubrious intoductions by the pedantic host of Masterpiece Theatre, and PBS icons lingering for 30 seconds at a time throughout the film.  Distracting, annoying, and unacceptable.  Order the Region 2 disc from the BBC if you can play it.  One should not pay a high price for a DVD that one could record off the air, and is little more than an ad for Mobil and PBS.
0 ||| The 1947-version is the best version, with John Mills, father of Haley Mills. I give the 1947-version 4-stars. The 1947-version is good.  In this 2004-version; actress, Justine Waddell, who was great as the sweet and wonderful Molly in "Wives and Daughters", co-stars. Here she plays an attractive woman, who has been raised by her jilted, grandmother to intentionally misuse and abuse men, who are infatuated with her beauty. She plays this part effectively as you feel the young man's emptiness in the end. However, I could not get into this version  The 1981-version has a better first episode; but then drags.  The book's author, Charles Dickens, married his wife Catherine in 1836. They were together 21-years, and had ten children. During his marriage Dickens wrote his brilliant novels: "Oliver Twist" 1839, "A Christmas Carol" 1843, and "David Copperfield" 1850. Mr. Dickens divorced his wife in 1858. Mr. Dickens wrote the story "Great Expectations" after his divorce in 1861. Divorce affects everyone no matter the circumstances. The 1947-version of "Great Expectations" is a good movie, but I did not like the part about the jilted, bitter, wealthy, old, grandmother; living in the dark, big house; with the dining-room and food left untouched for 50-years. Yet, if you persist through these strange scenes; the 1947-version is interesting later on in the film. I realize this woman is a necessary part of the story, but the film should have been much briefer with her.  Charles Dickens's book "Oliver Twist" is wordy, long, and daunting, unless you are a strong and imaginative reader. The "Oliver Twist" DVD is great for the rest of us, because the story has been so polished and streamlined by so many people. Before TV and movies; before radio, every town had a theatre that performed plays. Every town in England and America performed the play "Oliver Twist"; for 90-years, until sound movies. For 90-years; these towns kept polishing the story and improving upon each other. Today; on DVD, the polished story skips along without a bump. The story "Great Expectations" did not get this polishing in the theatre and has a few bumps. Yet, even with the bumps; the 1947-version is a good story.
1 ||| Even though I have never read the book I found this Production very good.  I would recommend this to any one who is a Dickens Fan but do youself a favour and don't buy this DVD release.  As a British review on Amazon uk site indicated this DVD looks as if it was copied straight off the TV and also the commentary in the beginning and end of the movie telling us about the Great Expectations novel made the DVD worse.  Masterpiece Theatre has spoiled this Great BBC Production of Dickens Great Expectations with it's Commentary (even though they think they are being helpful- but are not) and poor DVD.  Four Stars for the Production itself but giving this Two stars because of the DVD quaility.  Wait until BBC Release a DVD of the Production and the DVD quaility will be much, much better.  I will be selling this DVD and wait until BBC release the DVD in Australia.
3 ||| This is a well done version and follows the book with just a few minor changes.  Ioan Gruffudd and Justine Waddell certainly make an attractive Pip and Estella.  Charlotte Rampling as Miss Havisham is younger, more beautiful and a bit more sane than she is usually portrayed but the part is well acted.  The actors playing Joe Gargory, Magwich, Remmick, Orlick and Jaggers are all well suited to their parts and do admirable jobs.  The movie has quite a dark and sinister mood and a lot of the characters that provide comic relief in the book including Pumblechook, Wopsle, the Pocket family, and Clara's father are eliminated or have the humorous aspect's of their characters trimmed leaving us nothing to laugh at.  A brooding musical score and lots of scenes of the desolate marshlands, dirty London and the decay of Miss Havisham's house also contribute to the somber mood.
3 ||| There is a definitive modern flavor to this classic by Dickens, yet the handling of the story is very dignified and seems to translate to film almost perfect. Mobile Masterpiece Theatre's telling of Great Expectations accounts for many of the most important parts of the story, and those who have never read the book (or, those who chose not to read it in high school), will have an easy time understanding the story of Pip's rise and fall in both love and status. Certainly this is not some cheesy modern remake that tries to be hip and cool; instead it modernizes the tale in a way that is very "Dickenseque."  One of the greatest strengths of the film is characterization. Some may see Estella and Miss Havisham as being a little more "sensitive and kind" in this version compared to the novel, but overall they fit their roles well. Ioan Gruffudd does a superb job of Pip as an adult, who learns of his great expectations and tries to use these to gain a better status in life .Abel Magwitch, who is the convict who helps Pip earn a better life, is also played very similar to the character in the novel. I also felt that Joe was depicted essentially as the character in the book, and he really brings to life his love for Pip despite the fact that Pip at times resents him. Some of the other minor characters are also fun to watch: Mr. Jaggers, Mr. Wemmick, Mr. Pumblechook, Herbert Pocket, Biddy. The great thing about Dickens' characters is that they are unique and, at times, eccentric and, as a viewer, you can readily identify those characteristics as they come up in the film.  Another aspect of the film that was refreshing was just the scenery. The scene at the beginning with Pip encountering the convict in the cemetery, the grassland scene at the beginning and the end of the movie, and the dreariness of London (as Pip first arrives) all seem to be very illustrative of the attitude of the film.  One disappointing aspect of the film was that, at times, it was too obvious and blatant. It's almost as if the director decided that people were "too lazy" to understand certain parts, so they just thought they'd have a character "fill in" exactly what happened  rather than trying to let you decide on your own or show the scene the way it was intended. One example of this is the conflicts between Pip and Orlick.  Approximately 3 hours in length, this film still manages to cut quite a bit from the book and seem relatively short in length. I highly recommend this version, and it is much better than the Ethan Hawke/ Gwyneth Paltrow version of Great Expectations, which is very loose in its translation.  If you are looking for a modernized version of a great classic by Dickens, this is it. This film also works well for any teachers who want to do a comparison between the film and the book.  4  stars
1 ||| I've never read Dickens, or watched any movies/tv series based on any his novels, so I don't know what is from the book and what is from the movie director. I really enjoy historical dramas, especially BBC tv series. In this Great Expectations, the acting was good, especially the heartless little Estella. However, what I didn't like about the movie: 1. Too much scenery, not enough interaction. Instead of 10 seconds of Pip walking on the moors, we get 30 seconds. The same goes for birds flying, waves on the water, Pip walking through dark tunnels, Pip walking through dark streets, Pip walking up stairs, Pip rowing a boat. Pip opening doors and walking down dark hallways. Lots of extended scenes of scenery and no character conversations. Also, there're lots of scenes of Pip and Miss Haversham, Joe and the convict. But, there's next to no scenes of Pip and the love of his life, the grown-up Estella. Which leads to the next point: 2. As a result of the lack of scenes with Pip and Estella, we hear secondhand that she's unhappy, and we only hear Pip say that he's in love. The editing/screenplay is so choppy that we never hear why or how. I guess we are to assume from 10 minutes of the movie that Pip loves her madly because she is pretty and treats him very cooly. I mean, honestly, we get what's got to be a total of 30 minutes of boring scenery in the movie, and then almost none of the adult Pip falling in love with Estella, or what happens to Estella after marriage? 3. Discontinuity. I don't understand why Estella is so heartless and cruel as a child, then comes back as a soft mannered, kindly seeming lady. Is this a gentleman-trap of some sort? I give this 2 stars because the acting was very good, but the storyline is super choppy, cryptic, and unbalanced.  It would have been better if more time had been spent on explaining the plot instead of long panoramas of the scenery.
2 ||| This is a Master Theatre Version made in 1999, of Dickens' oft-filmed book which comes with stunningly beautiful photography and most strange decision about adapting the original book.  As if to resist the Americanized version starring Ethan Hawke made the year before, this film version, as far as I know, is the least romantic one ever made.  Whether or not you like the film solely depends on this aspect, so let me tell you about it first. The story is comparatively faithfiul, spending about 3 hours to cover the story of Pip, an apprentice of blacksmith who unwisely perhaps, falls in love with cold-hearted Estella.  But the film, as I said, gives more stress on darker side of the book, so the love theme is not explored as deep as other versions such as David Lean's or Alfonso Cuaron's.  Rather, the newer version seems to give more emphasis on the Pip's guilty feelings deep rooted in his contact with the runaway convict Magwitch, and the film's way of shooting the famous opening of the book, which relates their encounter on the graveyard in the marshes, gives us no time for savoring Dickensian humor.  The film uses the technique of flash-back, in order to express Pip's fear, which, I am afraid, is overdone for its own sake. I do not follow every details of the story (you probably have read the book), but I have to say this; like I said, this film is endowed with least amount of humor and romance.  Sure, you see Wemmick's most casual wedding; you see Biddy, Joe, Herbert (not all Pockets however), but you cannot expect to find any humorous scnes, one of Dickens' trademarks.  So, when Pip recounts how he met Miss Havisham before his sister and Pumblechook, he is literally forced to talk.  As you know, this is one of the humourous scenes of the original -- even though the humor is downplayed -- where we can see Pip makes up his own story, which gets more and more outrageous as he goes on.  But the director here didn't seem to see that way, depicting the whole incident as simply terrifying one for Pip, who must receive as much scolding and harsh words from them, as if in a tortune. Justine Waddle, often cast in costume dramas, is good as grown-up Estella, but before she could show something, the film goes on to follow the story of Pip, who must face bravely several darker moments of life (you know what I mean -- Orlick and Themes River), thus making least use of romance between Pip and her.  Actually, the film shows more of mud (of London and Pip's village) and decay, so the first thing Pip sees in London is the butchered cattles hanging on the hook.  It is true that Dickens' original book tells how Pip, arriveing in London for the first time in his life, wanders around Smithfield, then an open-sir cattle market, but ... do we need to know that? The portrayal of Gruffudd's grown-up Pip is so-so, but the most disappointed thing about the film is Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham.  Not that her acting is bad, but her Havisham simply does not convince me, being too weak in her gestures.  She should be more authentic as this witch-like woman often found in fairy tales, who commands people, not just talks.  If she does not follow the flamboyant acting of Anne Bancroft, that is OK.  I just need more enticing mystery in this enigmatic, willful woman, Havisham. Overall not bad if you look for bleak atmosphere in Dickens.  But for those who seeks for humor and romance in him, this is not the one to see.
1 ||| I guess I'm the only one disappointed in the Masterpiece Theater adaptation of Great Expectations, but I was.  Ioan Gruffudd is a fine actor, but he is no Pip.  The only aspect of his portrayal I liked was his devotion to Estella.  Even his horror at discovering the identity of his real benefactor was too "subtle" and too short-lived. I was even more disappointed in Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham.  She was too young, too soft-spoken, and too kindly -- not at all cold and distant -- and not at all manipulative.  And the scene of her incineration is terribly overdone. From the beginning ... in which we are told of Pip's visit to the graveyard ... to the end ... which is not at all in keeping with the spirit of Dickens' ambiguous ending ... this was a true disappointment. The Anthony Calf, Anthony Hopkins production for the Disney Channel is far superior.  I wish that one were offered for sale.
3 ||| of this version of the classic.  So dark and mysterious yet the costuming was lush and beautiful.  It felt a bit rushed at some points, but the character portrayals were extremely well done.  Highly recommend this one with Great Expectations.
3 ||| Filmed well , but not realistic! The two protagonist would of killed each other @ the start!
2 ||| BOTTOM LINE: IF you're a fan of big screen toughguy Lee Marvin, director John (DELIVERANCE) Boorman, or legendary Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune, then you may enjoy this. The slipshod script is the real villain of this WWII-flavored take on THE DEFIANT ONES. If nothing else, the gorgeous South Seas location scenery is worth gawking at. Some solid bonus content adds value. The nice hi-def transfer helps make this a marginal recommend. 3 STAR film, 4 STAR Blu-ray  THOUGHTS: With a couple of top-notch stars like this film has, it should have been a singular masterpiece. Instead, the scattershot screenplay has so many inconsistencies and head-scratching lapses in logic that it makes what otherwise could have been a great motion picture merely an interesting diversion. For instance: these guys spend how many months/years together, and yet neither one bothers to learn at least some of the other fellow's language? Basic communication is essential to increase the odds of survival and/or rescue, not to mention simply making their co-existence more bearable. Instead, they spend the film's entire running time screaming at one another in their native tongue. For cryin' out loud, they never even bother to learn each other's names! Really?!? Sorry, not buying it. Totally unrealistic. There's also a very unfocused transition as they go from enemies who first try and kill each other, then just try to annoy each other, then capture one another and torture the other guy... to just suddenly being too exhausted to fight, so they become tolerant acquaintances. Huh??? The downbeat ending is a nice try at poignant irony, but also falls flat in its execution. (The alternate ending, equally as depressing, isn't much better.) Again, I blame ALL of this film's problems on its script, which should've had another two or three passes, at the minimum, in order to eliminate the annoying incongruities and make the narrative flow better. Both actors are excellent, the direction is steady & solid, the cinematography is outstanding and the minimalist musical score is good. However, none of that can overcome a bad script and HELL IN THE PACIFIC has a muddling, mediocre script - at best.  THE BLU-RAY: Now the good news for fans of this film. The hi-def release of HELL IN THE PACIFIC sports a really nice transfer. The picture is crisp & clean, with solid blacks, strong mid-tones, and not much in the way of artifacting, pixelation or crush (video noise). The original film grain is also wonderfully evident, (no DNR tampering/overscrubbing!). The audio portion is clear and the soundmix is level. There are a half dozen or so bonus features, including interviews with the director and the art director, and a full-length audio commentary track, which help make this Blu-ray a solid bargain. If you love this film, this Blu-ray is a must-own. Casual viewers will still find much to admire, and lots of beautiful scenery to hold their attention. A nice hi-def effort from the crew at Kino Lorber.
2 ||| one of the best movies I've ever seen. this DVD was grainier than the original movie.
3 ||| Definitely a strange movie.  Being a Lee Marvin fan I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The character development between the 2 soldiers was great.  The ending had me wondering.  After watching I researched and read several reviews and learned about the alternate endings. That kind of helped me understand the movie better as I wasn't the only one that had mixed emotions about how it ended.
2 ||| This was not one of his better movies.  Kinda boring.  It was sent on time and in good condition.  I normally like Woody Allen movies.  Take the movie and run away.
1 ||| I had fond memories of TTMAR. So I watched it for the first time in 30 years. Now I find the movie lacking. TTMAR is very funny at times but the romance part did nothing for me (the scenes seem reminiscent of other late 60's movies I haven't watched in some time either. A man and a woman, Two for the Road?) and the gags are both too erratic and too far in between.
3 ||| Quite a strange movie actually, at once appearing simple but also complex, and the nihilist ending will not please many.  Strictly a "two-hander", (Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune), the latter speaking only Japanese throughout...no subtitles. You have to rely on Marvin's dialogue, and Mifune's expression. Now this is not as hard as it may sound.  It's also burdened with what has to be the weirdest selection of music as the soundtrack, varying from full church organ, loud discordant atonal concrete music and what surely has to be the sounds of air being allowed to escape from the stretched neck of a rubber balloon at one stage!  A basic story on the surface, just the two men from opposing armies, enemies marooned on an otherwise deserted Pacific island, struggling not only to survive, but hold each other at bay. At first the motivations seem to be to kill, but gradually that changes to a power play for dominance over and degradation of the other. The upper hand changes, but gradually realisation sets in that they will have to work together to survive, or even just get along. The astute may note that as the two are gradually stripped of the trappings of civilisation, they in fact eventually become more "civilized", ....and when later some of the outward comforts of the civilised world are available to them,such as clean clothes, shaving and alcohol/cigarettes/magazines, they then fall back into barbarism. Performances are good, ....although Marvin is perhaps a little too old for the character he's playing. The settings are genuine and their misery well-portrayed as they fight off thirst, starvation and the elements, ...even the sheer boredom. There is a somewhat odd scene where Marvin tries to teach Mifune to retrieve a stick as a dog would....Mifune is tied most uncomfortably to some sort of a large branch at the time as well as  being hobbled. Just who is teaching whom is open to interpretation as Mifune refuses and remains mute and impassive.....while Marvin continually demonstrates the demeaning task. Realising that no one is coming to rescue them, eventually the two begin to tolerate each other, then go further to co-operate enough to build a raft substantial enough to get over the surrounding reef. This being achieved, they sail off on the open ocean in search of rescue. A plane is heard, but when Marvin tries to use an old whistle to attract attention, Mifune grabs it and throws it into the water. Just why he does this is unclear. Eventually the raft drifts to some islands and upon coming ashore the two discover what seems to be a large abandoned military fortified gun emplacement. There are tense moments trying to discover whether it is Japanese or American, and tellingly, Marvin becomes concerned that the eagerly exploring Mifune may be shot by some American forces due to his being Japanese. Marvin repeatedly cries out "Don't shoot...don't shoot....he's my FRIEND!" Mifune appears suddenly from the debris, frightening Marvin who exclaims "Oh I thought you were a Japanese!" The point being that although he IS Japanese, Marvin has begun to think of him as something more than just a racial type with whom his country is at war.  It becomes clear that the base is now abandoned after what must have been some heavy fighting, but the two find clothes and saki to salvage, and also clean themselves up, then begin to enjoy some camaraderie over a few drinks.  Another weird scene ensues with Marvin drunkenly asking Mifune why the Japanese don't believe in God. Marvin himself, (the actor) appears very ill-at-ease performing this bit and it's not entirely successful. Nor is the reason for this uncomfortable scene at all clear. Then the pair suddenly become estranged again as Mifune sees some very graphic pictures of slain Japanese in an old Life magazine and wartime hatreds emerge once more. Then, ...just as you think we will see if their hard-won friendship from the island and the raft journey will last or they will once again become sworn enemies......BANG! That nihilistic ending I previously mentioned happens and that's it.  Many will feel they have sat through a long movie where not a lot of action has happened, only to be denied a proper denouement. I must admit it looked to me like they didn't quite know how to end it, and so went with the Apocalypse. You may of course feel differently, but the movie as it stands remains largely a psychological study of two men, rather than any war-action piece.  WARNING: Do NOT watch if the title has you hoping to see some Audie Murphy/John Wayne heroics, with intense battle scenes. You will be MAJORLY disappointed!  I enjoyed it for the power struggle and the humanity emerging over the nationalism, along with the performances, but must admit to finding the ending far too sudden and a most unsatisfactory way to dispose of two characters you have come to know over such a long movie. Does it all count for nothing? I wanted to see what they would do back in a world at war. Would they remain friends, or return to the roles that the war demanded they perform? I believe some copies include an alternate ending. Mine does not but it is available on You-Tube, and is only about a minute long. It too is enigmatic, not really telling you all that much about what happened next.  Four stars overall for me. (One off definitely for the ending.) I have the MRA DVD, ...transfer is good (but not brilliant) and the sound quite loud.
3 ||| I saw this film when it was released and went to see it again and it had the alternate ending. That really blew my mind! I remember standing up in the theater and yelling, "WHAT?" People looked at me like I was nuts! I asked the theater manager how the heck can this be and he had no clue. So, now searching for a blu ray edition of this great Lee Marvin flick to no avail. I sure wish they'd release a nice blu ray version. I love this movie. I've had the DVD for years now and it's a good version but with these new flat screen OLED (LG has them and this year Panasonic will too) sets that are out now, even a 4K version would be really cool. Watching good movies is a great pass time and with all this new technology in HD, it's just like going back in time and having these great works of art alive and living right in your own home! Don't forget the surround sound! Looking forward to a blu ray of this some day or even a 4K version. This movie is made for "watching", pick your own ending. Geez.......
2 ||| British director John Boorman's 1968 consideration of the  tremendously vicious hemispheric Pacific conflict of WW II is a brief, but unfortunately unsatisfying examination of the here leaderless, very dirty hand-to-hand combat that was island-hopping in the war.  Both Lee Marvin (who actually served as a Marine during the war in his youth) , and Mifune, a Japanese "star" of quite respectable dramatic stature give fine, necessarily muted performances.  But the plot sort of drifts lazily back and forth in the Pacific Palau, in a dreamy would-be interpretation of individual land-ops which one-on-one combat most assuredly should not  (cinematically) at least) be.  To do Boorman credit, Marvin does eventually bring the subject of the (Christian) God into the confrontation, but it's pretty much too late, and the audience leaves with the somewhat dull effect of having watched a war fought between business boardrooms, one democratic and one fascist, and who really needs that kind of history, if only merely dramatic?  Sadly, once again, "Old men start wars...young men finish them."
3 ||| good entertainment
3 ||| What is it about Robson Green that makes him so compelling? Is it his piercing blue eyes, or the sense that, no matter how inscrutable his expression, there's so much more going on inside his head that we're not privy to? Green is in no way what one might consider a Hollywood-type leading man--he appears small, his hairline is receding, and he's not conventionally handsome--but the man commands the screen like nobody's business. I found "Touching Evil" to be a fantastic series, so when "TE 2" became available, I grabbed it. Unfortunately, it took me some time to watch all the episodes. Perhaps this was because I was so impressed with the first series that I had high expectations. Maybe it was "sophomore slump." Ah, it was probably that the story arc of the first series was just plain more interesting. It is often the case that when the original creators of a series relinquish creative control to others, the quality suffers. This is also true of "TE 2," which sometimes seems like a pale reflection of the original. What it still has going for it, however, is the characters. I very much appreciate the circularity of the stories, bringing characters--like Creegan's wife and kids--in and out of the story at various points throughout the series. Shaun Dingwall alternately impresses and annoys with his portrayal of the unsteady DI Rivers, and Nicola Walker--another unconventional look but undeniably powerful--just knocks my socks off when she takes Creegan to task every so often. Maybe that's the key to why I enjoy the world of "Touching Evil" so much: It feels like family. And although I would love to see Robson Green in more visible projects, I sort of hope Hollywood never finds out about him. They just wouldn't know what to do with him.
3 ||| Hell of a flick.
3 ||| An interesting movie
3 ||| Fascinating film diverging from most war flicks in its presentation of the protagonists and their eventual grudging accommodation to their circumstances. Withheld a fifth star as I didn't like the ending.
2 ||| Woody Allen's uneven crime mockumentary marked his directorial debut. Despite its rough-edged quality, "Take the Money and Run" (1969) maintains a steady flow of visual and verbal humor. Allen successfully develops his comic persona in his first starring role. Even by today's standards, the film holds up better than most of Woody's recent output. Strangely out of print, the Anchor Bay DVD includes widescreen and full-screen versions.
3 ||| This movie will make you laugh til you cry, it really is hilarious from beginning to end. Woody Allen is at his best in this film that he also directed.   I'm giving it 4 stars as I did not like Janet Margolin as his girlfriend in this movie, thought a better choice could have been made to play this role. She seemed to be reading the lines throughout, not breathing any life into the role.  Other than that, loved everything about this film. A great pick me up if you've had a bad day and need some big laughs. This one is a keeper!
3 ||| What's not to like? Except the ending...Jesus, who wrote that ending? Marvin a real Marine in WWII who actually killed Japanese on Guadalcanal as a 19 year old, played a total realistic part. Mifume, the greatest actor to ever come out of Japan plays a smart realistic soldier. I cannot add more that what others have written on here.
2 ||| This is an interesting take on a more personal view on warfare - as Lee Marvin was a marine in real life in WWII.
0 ||| Should make it clearer in the description that it won't play on any domestic player. Tried to cancel order just a few hours after sending but got it anyway.  Seller was fine, quick shipping and decent packing but what good is that if the item is not usable in this country. Should list these items in a separate section. Very disappointing. Have sent it back.
3 ||| this is not the first movie in which woody allen starred.  however, it was the first movie which would form the pattern for the rest of his movie making life. ergo, he scripted it, directed it and starred in it.  if you followed his earlier standup act, this first movie captures the shtick he established with that act.  he is a character who can do nothing right yet he wants to be a criminal mastermind, especially with robbing banks.  he has some great comic moments in this film. in one he attempts to play a cello in a marching band.  in another he tries to escape prison using a gun he carved out of soap but it rains. these are great comic set ups and sketches.  the romance he sets up involves the female archtype we see in every woody allen movie. she is young, good looking, bright and, most importantly, not Jewish. his pursuit of the ultimate shiksa will continue in virtually every subsequent film. he gets better at this when he starts using Diane Keaton, followed by Mia Farrow.  many people would have liked woody allen to continue making comic movies like this one for the rest of his life. instead of continuing with this broad farce style, he would develop his own blend of combining comedy with tragedy instead.  i liked this film and laughed a lot but i'm glad he did not spend over forty years making variations of it. one of allen's biggest inspirations, the Marx Brothers, especially Groucho, did slight variations of the same comedic shtick over their entire professional lives.  allen took much bigger artistic risks by not sticking to these broad comedic setup gags.

3 ||| Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune are the only characters in this rather unique film.  Sworn World War II enemies, they find themselves marooned on a desert island together.  The story moves along, as the American and the Japanese gradually learn to mistrust one another less and less.  Even though neither can make himself fully understood to the other, they finally manage to construct a raft together and sail to a different island, formerly occupied by Japanese military, but now abandoned.  Unless the viewer happens to understand Japanese, the only person whose dialogue can be followed is Marvin's.  This is no matter, because one can get the jist of each situation quite easily.  Dubbing in subtitles would have been utterly stupid, not being needed at all.  What this amounts to is a low key anti-war story.  It also features two alternative endings, the first tragic, the second much the opposite.  It's worth watching.
3 ||| John Boorman's visualizes Robert S. McNamara's eleventh lesson of life and war; i.e., "...empathize with your enemy to better understand and combat him" and takes that notion to the extremes in this fabulous, intense movie metaphor.  Two soldiers -- American and Japanese (movie icons Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifuni) -- stranded on a South Pacific island, determined to fight to the death, instead discover life. A truly great war movie.  And ironically, a greater anti-war movie.
0 ||| I've never seen a worse comedy.  It has a promising idea (that a criminal would fail at every turn) but is so tightly over scripted that you can't even laugh in the wrong places.  There are none of the quirky truthful insights about real life that "Annie Hall" later had.  Woody Allen must be an absolutely humorless person.  The only good thing that can be said is that this failure forced him to go in a different direction.
0 ||| Played fine on my US Spec Blu Ray player but it is not widescreen, it is only 4:3 letterbox. Wait until the actual blu ray comes out.
3 ||| This is another, funny interesting comedy from Woody Allen in the vein of his early work. Good stuff. Great comedic style in classic Allen fashion.
2 ||| Very dated (late '60's type of humor) but still worth watching if you absolutely love Woody Allen's sense of comedy and his self-loathing study in cinematic pathos. I purchased a used copy and don't feel cheated. Perhaps a Woody Allen diehard fan's must have, but for the average person, this might be one of those you don't really need to own - or view. I watched it expecting more, but realized I've become overly sophisticated in my appreciation for comedy over the last four decades.  It's paced like a television movie-of-the-week, and there are long pauses throughout. The narrative theme is 40's years pass, but interesting for anyone who remembers "Tenspeed and Brownshoe" growing up...
3 ||| The Bottom Line:  One of the few films I can name with only two actors, Hell in the Pacific takes two of the world's most forceful actors (Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune) and casts them as enemies stranded on the same island in the Pacific with no idea of the other's language; something like the Twilight Zone episode "Two" without the romance, Hell in the Pacific is an interesting and unique film.
3 ||| I greatly enjoyed 'Hell in the Pacific' and it was more than I expected. I watched this movie the other night and got a lot out of it.  It's a very involving story set during WWII about an American pilot (the great Lee Marvin) and his Japanese counterpart (the equally great Toshiro Mifune) at odds with each other after they are both unknowingly stranded on the same small, uninhabited island in the vast South Pacific Ocean. They fight and quarrel for a good first half of the movie, but ------ realizing that they are both going to have to rely on the other to get out of their situation or to even survive ------ they gradually form an uneasy alliance.  I thoroughly appreciated John Boorman's obvious commitment to realism on this movie. As the film opens up, it just jumps into the story right away, beginning immediately with the image of Toshiro Mifune sitting alone near the beach and Lee Marvin in the jungle, likely just recently dropped in by parachute. The movie wastes no time with set-up or any explanation as to how they both got there. We don't know and don't need to. The editing is done at a smooth, flowing, non-hurried pace which gives the movie a definite real-time feel to it. The scenery and cinematography of the authentic Palau locations is simply stunning and I'm rather amazed by how good this movie looks for its age. The picture quality and clarity of this film is jaw-dropping for a 40 year-old movie. The performances from the sole two actors in the entire film are passionate, inspired and thoroughly believable. The setting and plot is almost enough to make one forget for a moment that the two are sworn wartime enemies and we almost immediately empathize with both characters.  There are no subtitles. It puts us more inside the two's struggle since neither can understand what the other is saying. Even though those of us who don't speak Japanese can't understand what Toshiro Mifune's character is saying, we know EXACTLY what he is feeling and thinking through actions, body language, and forcefulness of expression. Watch for the scene when Toshiro Mifune's character catches a real, giant clam and proceeds to crack it open to get to the real, soft mollusk inside just for the sake of a meal. After they are finally able to put aside their differences for the sake of their mutual survival, they collaborate to build a rather impressive wooden and bamboo raft to escape the confines of the island.  My only grievance with this movie was its ending. I will not spoil it, but I will say that I did feel it was inconclusive and didn't provide me with adequate closure for the two characters' ultimate fates. Even the alternate ending still left me feeling a bit unfulfilled but I will leave it up to each individual viewer to decide for themself. The ending just didn't quite work for me and was the only element that prevented me from giving this film the full five stars.  Overall though, this is still an excellent and vastly underrated 1968 gem from one of the best directors of all time, John Boorman. A unique cinematic experience in the fact that it features two prolific, unparalled actors each playing anonymous characters who are the only two in the entire movie in such a huge, isolated setting. A fasinating encapsulation of a very human story set against the backdrop of the WWII-era campaign in the Pacific.  17 years later in 1985, this film would be reimagined with a science-fiction twist as 'Enemy Mine'.
3 ||| I find Boorman's direction to be fantastic. As others note two military officers from opposite sides recognize each other. Mifune especially seeks with all his cunning to kill Marvin while the latter struggles very hard just to fill his canteen with drinking water. The tensions, very strong at the beginning slowly dissipate as both realize taking out each other might be very difficult but via cooperation--even despite the language barriers--two heads can equal the results of three. Mifune shows his tenderness first. But both play outstanding roles. While trying to develop the peace, Marvin reads a military manual that mandates troops always to kill the enemy.  Their keen attention to the nonverbals, even as both seem not to be observing is a case study for those intererested in interpersonal communication.  Marvin brings in new vitality once he recognizes there is bamboo on the island.  Yielding to each other in a collaborative manner, the raft is built and launched.  Then I got the impression they had to fight high waves without food on the ocean for perhaps four days. Both are exhausted. Discovering the new island is a dream, that neither perhaps thought would occur.  They forage through the deserted military hospital, each finding things of special interest  and then dressed neatly as military professionals toast each other countlessly with a big bottle of booze.  I wasn't ready for the end but tried to foresee possibilities.  For those who can take a movie with very limited dialogue, scores of nonverbals and two superb actors, this movie is a must. Those who enjoy more group drama or romantic entertainment would be bored.  I am glad to have found this movie in my collection. The VHS version plays very well.
3 ||| this is the JOHN BOORMAN i love . the director of "DELIVERANCE" and "THE EMERALD FOREST" in addition to this excellent and haunting film . in his twin outstanding lead actors , a very thoughtful screenplay and breathtaking photography and direction , it all comes together for me . i withhold the fifth star as i am conflicted about the ending . that was john's artistic choice though . i don't do alternate endings .
3 ||| This is both a serious movie and a parable.  Toshir Mifune plays Captain Tsuruhiko Kuroda, a proud Japanese Naval officer and Lee Marvin plays a downed American Pilot.  They both end up on a deserted small island.  They are mortal enemies, but somehow when you are both staring death in the face, it is easier to make common cause against it.  The story of the movie is how they overcome their hatred for each other (in the generic - wartime sense) to find a way to be found, signal for help, or get off the island somehow, someway.  Both actors are superb.  The parable is appropriate for a world ravaged by two-world wars the previous sixty years and now facing nuclear annihilation.  We need to pull together or we will die at each other's through for no good reason.  While I don't want to reveal what happens, it is instructive how vanishing cooperation and friendship are once the immediate threat seems to be past.  As I watched the movie, I could see how the Cast Away  and Enemy Mine both seemed to learn and use things from this film.  I think it is a pretty good film that should be seen yet today.

3 ||| In real life, Lee Marvin is a Marine that received a purple heart after being shot in the buttox during the battle for Saipan. Now here he is afterwards making movies where he is confronting his adversary and being the representative for the American side of the WWII GI psyche. His opposite is a Japanese soldier who equally does a splendid job to bring one up to speed with his culture. Both different and somehow the same. United together by a common goal of survival, yet on a hair trigger to let their warrior spirit flare. Interesting concept for a movie. Well done, appropriately cast.
2 ||| For a 60's era movie, this is funny, hip, daring, topical, and satirical...traits that are commonplace today but not that common when this daring film was made.  One of the reasons that I'm not a fan of Woody Allen (besides that the sicko impregnated his adopted daughter) is that I don't appreciate the whole nebbishy, neurotic, lack of physicality,  Jewish stereotype. I'm Jewish (albeit a "big" Jew)  and that persona does nobody any good.  However, in 1969, when this movie was made, that negative caricature, was not really utilized in the movies. Taking that stereotype and coupling it with that of a ruthless and bold criminal was unique. The notion that the viewer saw the caricature as always failing, yet the charactor himself did not perceive himself that way, was a refreshing way of telling a story. The story and narrative was so odd that I find the movie [still] refreshingly funny.  Favorite scene...when Virgil is frisked at the prison and cracks up because he's ticklish.
1 ||| This ABC VIDEO tape of Woody Allen's TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN (1969) seems suspect. Although the back cover says it's a licensed product, I can't imagine why FOX would allow a company to sell really BAD copies of any of their catalogue.  Further, ABC VIDEO is not affiliated with PARAMOUNT.  The tape tracks well and has good HiFi audio, but it's all downhill from there. Recorded at the slowest speed, it's got a blurry picture that over-saturates with color. Had I known ABC VIDEO meant: crapola, I wouldn't have bought this doorstop, and humbly suggest that you don't either.

3 ||| For a 1968 Hollywood-bankrolled war movie, HELL IN THE PACIFIC was almost right up there with the best of "foreign" films of the Sixties. Featuring only two characters throughout---a Japanese officer and an American officer marooned together on a otherwise unpopulated Pacific island in 1944---the film puts us immediately into the difficulties facing the two men, who are enemies by their circumstances and literally cannot understand each other. The story of how they deal with their plight unfolds in ways that make perfect sense, and both Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune as the two exiles give performances that are both believable and affecting. In fact, the only thing that keeps this from being a five-star movie for me is the very end, which, as I suspected, was grafted on at the behest of the studio heads [cf, director John Boorman's autobiography, ADVENTURES OF A SUBURBAN BOY]. The original ending, included on this DVD release as a special feature, makes much more sense and would have been better. But up until then you're watching one of the best war movies ever made.
2 ||| HELL IN THE PACIFIC is a curiosity.  Telling the story of two pilots, one Japanese (Toshiro Mifune) and one American (Lee Marvin), stranded on a small, deserted tropical island during World War II it's at once fascinating and somewhat flat.  Mifune and Marvin are two of my favorite actors.  Their plight on the island, coveting or guarding precious limited resources against the `enemy', more or less drives home the point that war is a futile exercise.  Of course the question arises as to whether we can conquer our distrust before we conquer, or are conquered by, our enemy.  HELL IN THE PACIFIC is thought-provoking and beautifully photographed by master cinematographer Conrad Hall.    After a while, though, with all the attacks and counter-attacks, I got the feeling that I was in the middle of a Road Runner cartoon with no exit.  This feeling was exacerbated by such scenes as Marvin trying to teach captive Mifune (the balance of power changes a number of times) to fetch a stick like a dog.  It was an ill-conceived scene, brutishly funny if the intent was humor, but added onto the ridiculous ending HELL IN THE PACIFIC seems to have expended its creative energy well before the final credits run.  By the way, I strongly recommend watching the `Alternate Ending' in the Special Features after watching the movie.  It's the right ending for the movie, and it's a mystery why it's the `alternate' one.
2 ||| Similiarities to the Enemy Mine movie could be made here. Perhaps the Enemy Mine writer got the idea from this story. Two men stranded on a Island rather than a planet in this case. As WWII rages a Japanese and American soldier are stranded on the same small island. They try to kill each other at first. As time goes by they realize their very survival depends on a truce. Eventually they work together and build a raft. After days on the Pacific Ocean they find another larger group of islands. The uneasy truce becomes shaky again when they find remnants of Japanese and American occupation on the main island. Up to this point an excellent movie. In fact I was say close to flawless movie since the acting, sets, scenery, music, directing and all the rest are incredible. SPOILER ALERT: Now the reason I didn't give it four or five stars is because they kill them off with a single stray artillery shell in the original ending. You will be enthralled with the wonderful acting and really care for these two characters. Then to suddenly watch their lifes snuffed out just so some writer or director could make their point that war is bad didn't impress me. If someone didn't think we get that point long before the ending of this movie, they don't give much credit to the audience. Why they didn't use the alternate ending with the soldiers walking off their separate ways is beyond me. Be sure to look at the alternate ending and see if you agree this should have been the original ending. Still well worth owning.
3 ||| I am surprised that this movie is not more well known. I just happened to borrow a copy on VHS from my aunt, and the movie simply blew my mind. It shows another side of WW2 and really blasts apart the stereotypes of the Japanese soldier portrayed in American propaganda films and also the American soldier as many Japanese were led to believe. The movie pretty much goes like this : Lee Marvin crashes into the ocean somewhere in the pacific and ends up on an island with the enemy, a Japanese soldier. Their fears and angers are played out as they both struggle to capture one another. They fight back and forth and also play mind games with one another in order to gain the upper hand. Finally, they learn that in order to survive they must put aside their animosity and work together. They slowly become friends and grow to trust one another and work together to build a small raft to escape the island. The Cinematography and acting in the movie are top notch, the only complaint I have was the original ending, but I have heard the DVD comes with alternate endings. I was also pleasantly surprised that John Boorman directed this film. SEE THIS MOVIE!
3 ||| Lee Marvin... a war veteran for real, so when Boorman decided to make him an even bigger star than he already was, he knew he was dealing with iconic material that needed to contrast with an equally fiery temper of a quite different kind. So he put another icon from the east opposite him, the king of the Samurai films, and made his first subversive feature. Hey, where else do you get to see Lee Marvin take a leak on Toshiro Mifune's head? Not in any other American cinema of the period, that's for sure! This should've been the war movie to end all war movies, because it just lays the whole absurdity out in such a hilarious laboratory test of extremes, no one who sees it ever forgets its almost "Naked and the Dead" type absurdist, thoroughly anti-war point of view, which is effective ONLY BECAUSE it makes the existence of evil an undeniable fact that needs to be checked and transcended by humans ALL THE TIME. Fans of idiotic, pointless 'WAR' dramas that senimentalize the 'mettle-testing' horrifically absurd experience called by that neanderthal-grunt-friendly three letter word into some kind of 'heroism' to justify the 'freedom-saving' lunacy for the poor dupes who went through it (the fantastically crafted but artistically mediocre "Saving Private Ryan," for one) need not apply, but anyone else looking for confrontational cinema in the humans-shooting-projectiles-at-other-humans-wearing-different-clothes genre would do well to start with "Hell in the Pacific," then move on to Anthony Mann's "Men in War," Sam Fuller's "Steel Helmet," and Bertrand Tavernier's "Capitaine Conan."  Peace Out Y'all, and remember to solve all your peace-time problems with a gun, as Tony Soprano would.
3 ||| "Hell in the Pacific" is a fairly early film in the career of  John Boorman, a sort of stealth director whose name rarely occurs to you  right away as one of the greats but who has done excellent work over many  decades.  "Deliverance" was four years off, "Excalibur"  and "Hope and Glory" further out, and the clean and sharp  "The General" a full three decades away. Lee Marvin is an  American pilot washed up on the shore of a small Pacific island in the  waning days of World War II -- only to find the one other inhabitant is a  Japanese officer played by the awesome Toshiro Mifune.  Although they carry  on the larger war between them for a time, they gradually realize the only  way either is going to survive and get off the island is if they work  together. But can they do it? Mifune's dialogue is all in Japanese and  not subtitled, so he is as mysterious and threatening to the viewer as he  is to the Marvin character, but we can tell by his actions, self-built  fortifications, and survival schemes that he's a smarter, more disciplined  man than the American. For a time, all the Marvin character can think to do  is pick away at the former's elaborate survival arrangements, and there is  quite a bit of humor in that. Leonard Maltin and the other Amazon  reviewers complain about the ending, which comes as an abrupt and  dissatisfying shock, but I think it offers the viewer a choice of  interpretations. It could be taken straight, as the objective fate of our  two heroes, or it could suggest a metaphor for their (and our) inability to  get along together, an image of humanity's potential ultimate fate --  something more in the characters' heads than on the ground.... Anyway, a  fine, tight little movie.
3 ||| Although it may not have been the BEST ending to this otherwise fascinating look at the humanity of war. Nonetheless this is a very enjoyable and intriging look at an awkward turn of events for two enemies forced to confront their foe on solitary terms. The ending was war itself.  Irony. Tragedy. Ending.
2 ||| Allen's first film as director, not the one of his best, but a good start to his brilliant career. All charasteristics of his ego are here seeding. After this about one movie a year which is pretty incredible. I hope he keeps going.
2 ||| This is a great Woody Allen film. However, it is only 85 minutes long, just like every other release. The description claims uncut 91 minute version. There is no extra material.  It is widescreen, but I have to compare it side-by-side with a VHS version to acertain if making it widescreen cuts off the bottom and top of the picture. All special features are only written text and only in Korean, so virtually no special features unless you read Korean.  Don't buy this because the description claims uncut version. It is not. It is, however, a really funny Woody film! Buy any domestic release.
3 ||| The Bottom Line:  A free-wheeling comedy by Allen, made before Annie Hall ushered in his more serious phase, Take the Money and Run offers a lot of laughs in a short period of time; its humor is not always sophisticated, but it should crack you up quite a bit.
1 ||| Probably the least funny of the old Woody Allen films that I've been re-visiting.  Although I really did like the scene where he is given an experimental vaccine and suffers the unusual, "Side effects of turning into a rabbi for several hours."
0 ||| I wouldn't call myself a Woody Allen fan but I thought this film was simply hilarious and most of the jokes and gags hold up well even today and if you like off-beat humour ala "There's Something About Mary" or even "Saturday Night Live" you will find a lot to like about this film.  The jokes come thick and fast and although not all of them score, the vast majority of them do making it a comedy that rewards repeated viewing.  The only problem is with the dvd which is not restored in any way and so the picture and sound quality really suffer in comparison with what's currently out there.  There are no special features of note either.  This film is certainly one of the funniest and most enjoyable that I've ever seen but my advice is to wait for the Blu-ray version that significantly restores the picture quality as well as adds good special features and has good audio options such as at a minimum a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround option to do justice to your home theatre system.
3 ||| This is one of the funniest Woody Allen films. I don't know why it was released in full screen and that is why I deduct one star. One of Woody's less complex comedies, but still one of my favorites. The DVD transfer looks good, but a widescreen version should have been included.
3 ||| Woody Allen stars and directs for the first time, and what a success it turns out to be. There are many great sight gags as well as the usual number of quality one-liners. The film is done in a documentary style, telling the story of Virgil Starkwell, an incompentent petty criminal, played by Woody of course.  To pick a favourite moment out is difficult. However, if forced to pick one I'd go for the scene where Virgil tries to rob a bank, and fails because he hands over a note where the word gun can easily be mistaken for gub. Consequently the entire bank staff and customers are all arguing whether the word is gun or gub. Woody insists its gun; everybody else thinks its gub...  This is definitely one of Woody's early funny ones!
2 ||| This is an early film (his first) of comedian /actor/director Woody Allen starring himself in the lead as Virgil Starkwell a bungling wannabe bank robber whose hijinks land him in prisons, in bed with a lovely girl and the halls of academia as an expert on crime. In this film we can see the outlines of Woody's seemingly endless love affair with early black and white crime and film noir classics. There is a little more use of sight gags here than in latter films but through it all Woody is still the funny bumbling New York Jewish kid that a long series of films will explore in greater detail. The use of an old time newsreel announcer to describe and set the framework of the film and detail the action is an interesting twist. Not the best Woody Allen film but a good look at the niche that he created for himself in American urban comedy/ social commentary cinema.
2 ||| Long before Christopher Guest mastered the genre, Woody Allen made a comic mockumentary of the life of a failed bank robber named Virgil Starkwell complete with newsreel footage, excerpts from interviews with people in his life (including his embarrassed parents in Groucho Marx masks) and a stentorian voiceover narration by Jackson Beck. This fitfully funny 1969 comedy marks Allen's feature film debut as a triple threat - director, writer (with early partner Mickey Rose) and star, and it shows the earmarks of his later visual style even if the laughs are not always there.  Lacking an actual storyline, the movie takes us through Starkwell's life from shoplifting bubblegum machines as a youngster to bank robberies to finding the ideal woman to prison and so on and so on. This is Allen at his purest with focus on often hilarious sight gags and self-deprecating one-liners without his later forays into the complexities of the human condition. In fact, this is probably the only time that Allen has played a screen character without any intellectual pretensions. The closest he comes is pretending to be a cellist with the Philharmonic to the girl of his dreams, a pretty laundress named Louise. The best gags are probably the prison shirt-folding machine, the bank robbery where Starkwell's badly handwritten note is passed around the staff to interpret, the escaped chain gang coming into the old woman's house, the prison vaccine experiment that turns Starkwell into a Hassidic rabbi, and my favorite, the totally impossible scene where he drives a car inside a blackmailing woman's house chasing her around.  Of less interest is the romance between Starkwell and Louise, who is portrayed as self-conscious and rather mealy-mouthed. Allen's usual generosity with actresses has not yet developed at this point, and Janet Margolin is forced to play Louise quite passively despite her beauty. For a movie that is supposed to take place between the 1940's through the early 1960's, it certainly looks and feels like hippie-era 1969, especially with the Austin Powers-style music over the chase scenes. Allen's first wife Louise Lasser (yes, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman) has a funny cameo as an early girlfriend. There are no extras with the 2004 MGM DVD package.
2 ||| This early Woody Allen comedy is often quite a bit of fun.  Check out some of the other reviews here, which recount a few of the better sight gags and funny scenarios to see what I mean.  Just be warned, though, that Woody still had a way to go before the jokes got really sharp and the storylines moved with supreme smoothness.  I don't want to overstate the criticism, as "Take the Money and Run" never sinks to boredom, or choppiness in the story telling.  It's just that Woody's best period was still three or four films ahead of him at this point and a certain lack of polish is still evident.  But the movie is still definitely worth a look, even though I'm not as big a fan of it as some other folks.  Unfortunately, the full-frame version of "Take the Money and Run" is the one most easily available on DVD in this country.  On the plus side, however, I noticed no obvious and offensive cropping of the image while I watched the movie (though I guess something must have been cropped somewhere to create the full-frame image).  Also on the plus side, the print is sharp, clear, and bright.  But, alas, like most DVDs of Woody's films, there are basically no extras, just a trailer.  But we've come to expect that from Mr. Allen, haven't we?  To his credit, the man doesn't like to go on and on about his movies, preferring to let them speak for themselves.
3 ||| Allen's directorial debut is a joy from beginning to end. By no means does it have the depth and sophistication of his later work, but it's consistently funny, with one gag running into the next, and there are teasing moments of that blur between fantasy and reality that characterized his films.  The story concerns one Virgil Starkwell, a bespectacled failure who resorts to crime for a living, and can't even be a success at that. He tries to stage a bank robbery, but it flops when the tellers start arguing over whether his handwritten note says "I have a gub" or "I have a gun". It's told partly in a spoof-documentary style that foreshadows Allen's later full-blown mockumentary, Zelig (1983).
2 ||| From around this early time, before Allen truly crystallized his peculiar brand of a nebbish neurotic New York man, I had enjoyed Bananas and Sleeper for their sheer creativity and comic pizzazz. I thought Take the Money and Run would be in a similar league but unfortunately it's not. A prescient newsreel style voiceover constitutes the narrative device of choice, putting its personal spin on events as it recounts the life of our doozy criminal, Virgil, a nerd turn notorious gangster. It is this wry commentary that lends the film its pseudo-documentary flavor, and the plot is pretty much a patchwork of such clips and thus not exactly awash with consistent humor. Certain scenes are pretty funny though, e.g., the protagonist's escape attempt at the prison that involved a bar of soap and some shoe polish, or a bizarre incident with a chain gang, etc. For Allen fans, it's a no brainer: you'll see it anyway. For the rest of the viewers, I'd recommend giving other more polished comedies from Allen a try before you get to this erratic early-in-the-game cameo. It simply hasn't stood the test of time.
3 ||| Take The Money & Run is the first film that featured the Woody Allen triple threat of writing, directing and starring.  The film is set as a documentary on the life of the worst criminal of all-time, Virgil Starkwell, who never pulled off a successful crime in his life.  The film is a fast-paced and sharply written.  It sets up the Woody Allen persona, the likable loser, that he would portray in most of his subsequent films.  Take The Money & Run is an excellent start to a movie legend's fabled career.
2 ||| "Take the Money and Run" will not entertain or humour those of us familiar with the rest of Woody Allen's sparkling oeuvre. Its only real value is as a curiosity. This is Woody establishing his template for later movies, i.e., nebbishy loser, a failure at his chosen occupation, acquires an impossibly beautiful girlfriend, and tries to do right. The mockumentary style he chooses to utilize for the most part works nicely. At times, though, its tone feels uneven, floating from documentary to narrative fiction and back to documentary. If he had stuck to one style the power of the satire would be much stronger. And now that I think of it, choosing to do an obviously mannered genre parody with your first film is somewhat dubious. It sent him on a path that would lead to the well-meaning but uneven films "Bananas" and "Sleeper". Not till "Love and Death" would he make a film where the parody serves the story rather than the story serving the parody. While most of the jokes feel forced, there are some truly hilarious proto-Woody moments. The marching band scene (with Woody gamely trying to keep up while tugging along his cello and a chair) knocked me down flat with laughter. And a moment late in the film, with Woody trying to conduct a substantive interview with a rambling subject (Woody keeps saying "Get to the point" from behind the camera), is a most effective moment in terms of parodying the documentary form. But other than these, and few others, I was disappointed by the humour. A running gag, where Woody's glasses repeatedly get stomped on by authority figures, was flat the first time I saw it and got flatter each subsequent time. This film is definitely at the bottom of my personal list of favourite Woody Allen movies. It may be because I prefer his dexterous verbal wit to the juvenile sight gags and physical humour he employs here, or that he had yet to find his footing with this, his first outing. Either way, if you take a pass on "Take the Money and Run", you won't be missing too much.
3 ||| This is the best of Woody Allen's strictly-for-laughs movies.  The interview segments which he uses for both comedic and dramatic purposes in many of his films are probably the most fun here, particularly his  "parents" who wear disguises.  The gags are much better than in  his "Bananas" and the more than slightly silly plot doesn't bog  down as in his "Sleeper".  There are no big moral soapboxes, this  movie is just funny.
3 ||| A wonderful parody of crime movies, this mock-documentary tells the story of the worlds most unlikely (and unlucky) criminal - Allen's Virgil Starkwell. This movie goes purely for laughs and is most often successful.  Allen's gift of tapping into the absurd has never been displayed better.  Film is full of gems : Allen being punished by being sent into a hole with  an insurance salesman, his humiliated parents wearing Groucho Marx masks to  disguise themselves and Allen's deadpan backhanded compliment to his  girlfriend: "That's a nice hat...I see them all over town....Yeah,  they're on sale...in those big bins...millions of them." A delicious  comedy. If you loved "Play It Again Sam" or "Sleeper"  you'll love this one.
3 ||| My child love it and sings the song all the time
3 ||| My three year old watched it, she sings it, and about two weks later she was doim=ng number 1 & 2 in the potty. I'm gonna start having my two year old watch it.
2 ||| Bought this video to encourage my 16 months old daughter to start using potty. Unlike other videos, both of us don't seem to be interested in watching the video very often. The voice of Hannah sounds weird, not quite sure it is a sound of a male or a female and sounds no innocence of a young child. Hearing the voice of Hannah bothers me a lot. The tone sounds very flat, like "Hannah" is reading the script.  The music is catchy but the song is boring. I cannot bare to listen to it more than 3 times.
2 ||| Good condition, quick ship, good price, thank you.
3 ||| I truly enjoyed the series!  Very entertaining-good acting!  I would recommend this series to any one.
3 ||| Very well done. I had heard people talking allot about this during it'd time but did not get to watch it till now. The characters were wonderful. I became so involved that there were times I cried. A really top drawer series.
3 ||| Season 4 is pretty good, but somewhat sad as well.  There are some very good performances by  members of the cast .
2 ||| I remember seeing this show on PBS as a child. I became interested in watching it after seeing Downton Abbey. I really liked the first season of the series. I watched it in a marathon over a cold winter weekend. The second season kept my interest and I watched it over another winter weekend. It is still interesting but not as much as the first two seasons. I didn't like some of the character changes and some of the original character such as Hudson & James Bellamy became a bit irritating to me. If you liked seasons #1, #2, #3 & Downton Abbey, give it a watch. I watched it to finish out the series. It is not as good as the previous seasons.
3 ||| It is always sad to hear, read, and or see how the World War I and II impacted people's lives.  Learned a bit more of history watching this show.
2 ||| Most of this season was boring for me. Mainly because I got tired of James character and he began to annoy me. The other story lines were interesting.
3 ||| I don't remember what famous person made the quote "War is Hell".  It is an accurate statement, of course.  Season 4 of the Bellamy's follows them through the first World War.  I am sure that the scripts were historically accurate. Season 4 upholds the series tradition of EXCELLENT acting, plots, and production quality.  I could not give 5 stars because I found the amount of time and detail devoted to war-time plots became a little depressing.
3 ||| After three seasons most shows have really started to wind down. The same is true about this series, but it doesn't mean there aren't a few stories left to tell.
3 ||| The stories might be from the past but are able to relate to them in the presence.  It's nice to have entertainment that isn't tainted with profanity and nudity.  Wish all tv shows could be at this quality.
2 ||| I did not watch this movie..we saw the trailors and it was ordered through a glitch in our computer when trying to order or pre order a 4TH season of Downton Abby. Sorry, but we won't be watching it either.
3 ||| The Bob Newhart Show was one of the 10 best TV shows ever, and the picture quality in this 6-tape collection is very good. It's nice to see all the episodes in their uncut form, as opposed to the reprehensible syndication practice of cutting scenes to sell more commercial time. My only qualm with this collection is that there are only 2 episodes per tape. Hopefully there will be a DVD collection of this excellent series and the follow-up series, Newhart (1982-1990).
1 ||| The series itself arguably merits 5 stars, but after trying to watch three, allegedly brand-new discs that had to "skip over damaged areas," I gave up and returned the whole set for a refund. Shout! is respected for the quality of its products. I'm at a loss to interpret what happened.  REVISION OF PREVIOUS REVIEW: At times it is difficult in Amazon reviews for readers to determine exactly what is being reviewed: the product (in this case, a TV series), its manufacturer (here, Shout!), or the vendor with whom Amazon is dealing (Crystal Choice). To clarify: (1) The first Newhart show is a classic sit-com. (2) Crystal Choice is an honest vendor that tried to make good on a sale that backfired through no fault of their own. (3) Shout! atypically, in my experiencehad quality control problems with the new set of discs I was sentthree of which were unplayable.
1 ||| Last season, not so funny.
3 ||| I didn't see much of The Bob Newhart Show when it was originally on television, so almost all of this series was new to me.  During the first season, I was only getting a rare chuckle, if that, out of the episodes, and I was wondering if I had made a mistake in purchasing the complete series.  Fortunately, seasons 2-5 were better, and I was getting chuckles and sometimes laughing out loud at the episodes.  The introduction of the character known as "The Peeper" was, for me, a misstep, because he was too over-the-top silly to be amusing.  Season 6 was a letdown, with more slapstick (e.g. Zorro) and fewer good jokes.
3 ||| Great series
0 ||| The most looked-forwarded to movie of the year for me. Now, the one I hope I can forget the quickest.  I blame it all on the director. Who in Hollywood pays these imbeciles to make a movie like this. How in the world  could anyone ruin a movie starring Fiennes, Connery, Thurman? - Totally  beyond my comprehension. If anyone out there knows  a place I can get an  elective frontal lobotomy, please let me know. Do a service to one in deep  suffering.
3 ||| I happen to like Bob Newhart even though he is pretty much the same all the time.  This series is certainly "dated" but it is well done and amusing. I enjoy watching an episode every day or two when I sit down with a cup of coffee.  I'm glad I purchased it and look forward to many  ours of enjoyment. A FEW WEEKS LATER....I'M BEGINNING TO BE VERY UPSET AT THE NUMBER OF EPISODES THAT CANNOT BE VIEWED BECAUSE  OF FREEZES.  THE WHOLE LAST HALF OF SEASON 4 COULD NOT BE VIEWED AND 2 OR 3 EPISODES OF AN EARLIER SEASON WERE THE SAME WAY.
3 ||| good.
2 ||| Losing some steam and pooping out.  And episodes without Bob?  It was time to call it a day.  And back then I believed they had already.  Didn't know it was still on that year at the time.
2 ||| Patrick McNee has a bit part in this film. Reason enough to have a copy.  The movie tried to add too much of the quirks old series that made it  campy. This DVD has the version that was in the theaters.
0 ||| I cannot believe Sean Connery would put himself into such a horrible film
3 ||| One of the coolest TV shows from a time when there was something on that didn't insult your intelligence.
3 ||| This is a very fun movie. I love the characters.
0 ||| Eh, I liked the episode when Emily goes camping with Bob's father and maybe a couple of other episodes with her, but I was not amused with his patients and since Bob wasn't in a few of the last episodes very much you could tell he had lost interest.  I would not buy this again and I wouldn't watch the shows over and over again.  After watching maybe two episodes twice I tried to sell the set and Amazon wouldn't let me because I don't have my account set up to have Amazon stock the items for sale.  So the videos are just sitting in a cabinet.
1 ||| Some DVDs disc didn't work
2 ||| Was ok, the sound did not work on my blue ray/ streaming content player
2 ||| Definitely not up to the standards of the TV series. Ralph Fiennes is a second rate John Steed. Uma Thurman is a little better as Emma Peele but making her an expert in every science is a little much. Having two people running the agency is too much. Having the man code named Mother and the woman code named Father is too cute by far.
0 ||| Wow! This is a terrible movie!
2 ||| perfect
3 ||| Bob Newhart's trademark dry humor shines throughout the show's sixth and final season (although Newhart's frequent absence by mid-season, due to other filming obligations, doesn't go unnoticed).  Aside from Bob and Emily's move to a new apartment (because apparently the old one wasn't "spacious" enough!) and then magically having Howard move into a neighboring apartment (which is never actually explained - Howard just resumes his regular routine of barging in every day) the season continues much as before. Bob meets regularly with his clients, particularly the infamous Mr. Carlin; he and Emily socialize with Howard, Carol, Jerry and others. Although plot-wise there is little that is truly unique or surprising, the show still works. The actors' chemistry, Bob's traditional straight-man shtick against the blundering Howard or goofy Jerry, the ridiculous statements of Mr. Carlin (all delivered in deadpan) continue to amuse and entertain.
0 ||| This was the biggest bomb  there are only 1 Emma Peel and 1 John Steed,,,,Diana Rigg and Patrick MacNee  RIP  next time you want to try a film.....based on series use them which can be no longer done RIP PATRICK MAGNEE  and forget the hacks
3 ||| no comment
2 ||| These old Bob Newhart shows don't have the quality of writing or wit of "Frasier"  or "Everyone loves Raymond."That being said, it was fun seeing the styles and designs from the era.
1 ||| Dumb!!!
3 ||| While not entirely true to the classic TV series, this movie is very true to the theme of an ultra-British spy spoof.  The villain's house is VERY well-appointed, and the heroes have an interesting way of crossing the Thames to go after him.  It's just too bad that the film makes for a tricky search, with all the Marvel superhero films showing up.  It's worth finding!
0 ||| As a major fan of the original series I watched this move about 15 years ago and hated it. Today I thought maybe I was in a bad mood that day, but no, it is that horrid. There simply is nothing here. A pathetic Steed for sure. It is all imitative and it fails. There is no plot. After seeing it twice I still have no clue who Sean Connery was supposed to be or what it was all about. The Emma Peel clone is pure stupidity and just wastes all the screen time. I can't understand why anybody thought anybody would like this. Complete failure.
3 ||| A bit goofy, and not like the series but well in the spirit.
3 ||| An awesome action adventure. Creative and involving. Sean Connery delivers a great performance as Sir August DeWynter, an maniacal genius and former British Intelligence agent (?) with an axe to grind with the Royal Empire. He has stolen control of a satellite that allows him to control the weather everywhere on the planet. He is holding the world hostage and has a hefty ransom. So British super agent John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) is called into action to stop him, and he is first advised to bring in Dr. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), a noble prize winning physicist and the number one suspected ally of DeWynter after video footage of her surfaces implicating her in the murder of a high ranking member of the British business community. After he brings her in to meet Mother and Father, they determine she is innocent. But if so, then who is the woman on the video? They decide to team up to get some answers, and start at the home of Sir August DeWynter, where they quickly discover who their enemy is. But he is ready for their every move, and has them both at his mercy in a hurry. But they also soon discover he has a friend on the inside who gave him vital information to help him steal the weather satellite. A mole in British Intelligence. But who? This a exciting and involving action film that has every bit of the charm and charisma of the popular 60's TV series, and all the gadgets as well. It gets a 90's update, of course, but still keeps true to the show at the same time. Thurman and Fiennes have great onscreen chemistry, and as I mentioned, Connery was awesome. The idea of him being a former British agent was a bit cheesy, but still worked well. Brief nudity and mild language are all parents will have to worry about. There's a ton of action and snappy banter, as well as tea. Their was no sequel, which I felt was unfortunate. It didn't exactly kill at the box office, which might be its only downfall. I found it enjoyable and fun.
3 ||| I love the Avengers,  Although I like Emma Peel more than Tara King. I would like to buy more 68 volumes but they are priced to high. I am hoping they come out with a whole 1968 package for a reasonable price.
3 ||| Quite a few reviews were pretty negative.  I found the film not great but a clever parody.  Opening art work was a 'take-off' of all the "007" openings.  Don't look for an action flick tho it has that.  Enjoy the subtulties, the double meanings, and the wit.  I don't usually watch videos a 2nd time but this could be one that I do.  Just to enjoy the clever playing against each other.
2 ||| A bit dull but Ralph makes it exciting!
2 ||| I am a fan of the original television show the Avengers. Emma Peel, obviously but even more, Tara King. I know the movie is religiously panned by reviewers but I am not a purest in respect to most beloved television. This movie is incredibly light and absurd. It is not like the television series in anyway, to my mind at least. it contained the elements but they were performed and presented differently so I take them as they are given. For what it is this movie is an enjoyable bit of fun for an otherwise lazy afternoon stuck at home.
1 ||| Seeing Sean Connery in such a silly role is kind of worth it just as proof that it actually happened. Otherwise, I was surprised to see that Eddie Izzard is in this as well but is completely wasted as they gave him only one line in the entire movie - come on, he is a stand-up comedian!  Anyway, silly story, not greatly acted, and sub-par pacing makes this one to avoid for the most part.
3 ||| I wish there were half stars available because this set is not quite good enough for 4 stars but too good for 3. As others have said, this last season isn't as funny as previous seasons and Bob Newhart is away for many of the episodes. With that said, a mediocre episode of The Bob Newhart show is still better than most of what's on TV these days. I would give the content of this season 4 stars but, as much as I hate to say it, the quality of many of the transfers on many of these episodes only deserves a 3 and some less than that. I can handle grainy but a couple of episodes are so washed out that everything in the scene looks sepia toned and the colors are barely there. So, I agree that this season is a must for those of us who have been waiting to complete our individual sets and appreciate Bob Newhart in any form, but the quality isn't quite up to previous seasons.
3 ||| Everyone's glad the final season of this venerable classic finally came out on home video as a stand-alone release, so hurrah for  the completists!  That said, despite some fine moments, the show begins to look tired in this season. Right away, the Hartleys move -- but only to an apartment on a different floor! So nothing really is changed except the decor and some of the off-screen layout. Howard is still THERE all the time, which becomes more and more ridiculous (even the new title sequence seems to poke fun at this) and I swear he  was made dumber and dumber as the series went on, resulting by season six  in a Howard Borden man-child personna  who is no longer a believable adult character (this man is a navigator for an airline?!?).  The plotlines and stories seem a bit shop-worn and many episodes near the end of the run  just trail off without any big topper or clear resolution.  Finally, and most unforgivable, Bob seems to be literally phoning in his appearances to the point of hardly even showing up in many episodes. Was it a sarcastic message to viewers,  how often the token Bob Newhart scene in a host of episodes is him on the phone in an airport or hotel, checking in with Emily?  Three minutes of Bob doesn't even allow for a decent "Hi, Bob" drinking game!  Even the finale is very abrupt and undeveloped, and then, that's all folks.  Kind of a wheeze-out for a show that in its prime was the sharpest written sit-com on television and still one of the best of all time.  Season Six is not the place to begin for newbies, but once you've watched this far, you might as well collect 'em all.
1 ||| This movie had some plusses going for it, primarily the cast.  A lot of money was spent on the production design and special effects, but the film suffers from a misconceived premise.  First of all, it's dealing with a witty, effervescent spy romp -- an iconographical series of the 60's -- but it tries to turn it into a darker, insupportable James Bondian (same production designer).  "Dark" and the Avengers don't really mix.  The whole production is dark, lots of crashing special effects, derring do, conflict between "Father" and "Mother" which is never explained.  The dialogue is hard to understand and captioning is not provided on the streaming version.  A problem.  Other elements in the script are also confusing--the Emma Peel imposter, rationale, etc.  The direction is just leaden and that's fatal to this type of film.
0 ||| What an awful movie!  It reached a climax and then went another 20 minutes.  Uma Thurmond doesn't have the charisma of Diana Riggs.
2 ||| Ralph Feinnes and Uma Thurmond gave a workmanlike performance in this show.  It had a copule of nods to the original series, with Patrick McNee playing the invisible archivist and the show ending with the original Avengers theme. The overall flavor of the performance was more like Jame Bon, with the constant sexual innuendo (a crutch for mediocre writers) and less intelligent dialogue than the original.
0 ||| Pure garbage, I will not waste any more words on this cinematic rubbish. Do yourself a major favor if you have been brave enough to watch this crap all the way through,immediately afterwards watch an original "The Avengers" episode it will help cleanse your soul!
3 ||| I got this to replace an old vhs copy, love it! Sometimes the oldies really are the ones to watch!
0 ||| I like British stuff. I like spies...but this movie kept putting me to sleep; however, there was this one bit where they were driving a convertible and pressed a button on the dash and hot tea came out of the tap. They drank it from actual cups and saucers while going down the road. When the credits started rolling, I realized that Voldemort had been in it...Ralph Fiennes as John Steed. Sean Connery was also in it. I do like his voice.
1 ||| This has got to be one of the worse movies ever. Especially since the elements to make an interesting movie were already there. Story. Characters. They even had decent actors. The dialogue was terrible.  But there is something strangely benign about it. It doesn't make you angry. It lulls you. To sleep. Sometimes that's not a bad thing.  I have several movies I put on that put me right to sleep. This is one of them. Maybe it's the low droning sound that is the characters speaking. Worth the $3 used I think I paid.  Fargo puts me to sleep too. Something about the snow.
0 ||| Just a terrible movie.  Quite possibly the worst Uma Thurman has been involved in.  Rating it on its own merits, it's not that bad of a movie-- just kind of silly and dumb and totally forgettable.  Comparing it to the Peel-era shows is what makes this very hard to watch.  First of all, Uma Thurman looks nothing like Diana Rigg.  Jessica Biel would make a much better Emma Peel.  Secondly, this is set in modern day.  So much of Peel's persona has to do with how she twirls her flip or wearing those white gloves.  Without that hair and clothing goes much of the essence of Emma Peel.  Sealing the tomb is a barrage of crappo CGI which makes the whole thing look like the graphics on a fast food cup set to motion.  For a dumb film of a similar flavor which actually succeeds at being a comedy, just rent "Austin Powers".
3 ||| Video quality is not a good as the first four seasons, but is outweighed by FINALLY having the entire series here at home.
3 ||| I watched all The Avengers way back when, and own all of them now. As John Steed and Emma Peel, Patrick McNee and Diana Rigg are and probably always be irreplaceable and unsurpassable.  Should you watch/get this movie? Depends. Can you accept that Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman, as Steed and Peel, are not McNee and Riggs, and are not trying to imitate the TV actors? That, as with King Lear, different actors can bring different qualities, different interpretations, to a role? If you can, yes, get this movie. Fiennes is diffident, where McNee was suave. Thurman is titillating, where Rigg was provocative. Some of the movie is silly; so was some of the TV show. (And remember, The Avengers was picked up by US TV not because it was good, but because it was the 60s, it had spies - and it was cheaper than making a show in the States.)  This will never be the definitive The Avengers. But if you have an open mind, give it a look. Better (IMHO) than another couple of hours with another 'reality' show. Then, if you haven't, watch McNee and Rigg too. And if you have, watch them again, after some well-spent time with Fiennes and Thurman.
2 ||| The 60s' Brit TV show was never one of my faves. It was a low-budget James Bond spoof, which Bond itself was as a spoof of Cold War spies in general,, though not low-budget. Here, despite three big name stars, the film never quite takes off, seeming instead like nothing so much as a, well, high-budget TV show. In the 60s, the sexual tension between agent John Steed and Mrs. Peel was highly suggestive stuff. Today, it seems quaint, almost literary. Never mind the plot here. It's a mishmash of more Bond crossed with Lord of the Rings special effects. Some mumbojumbo about a megalomaniac controlling the weather. The whole point of this movie is archness. Sometimes it works and often it's just tedium. Watch if there is nothing else.
0 ||| Combine the worst elements of Wild Wild West and Batman & Robin and you get this god-awful mess of a film that's as confused tonally as it is made poorly. And made poorly it is. The score is over-blown & barely fits within a scene, the dialogue is atrocious, the acting is embarrassing to all involved, the plot is convoluted as all get out, and there isn't a single genuinely good moment to be found.  First off, tone. I've never been more baffled as to what the filmmakers were going for than I was with this film. It didn't really strike me as serious, but it never struck me as a comedy or a parody either, or even campy. I've never seen the TV series, but my god, I don't think it had people dressing up in Teddy bear costumes! That's right, Sean Connery, and a bunch of other people in a board room wear teddy bear suits. Why? So they don't know who each other is. Why teddy bear suits? I have no earthly idea. In a way, it's sort of charming in the way "Toys" was with Robin Williams and that crazy world, but any charm is zapped by the utter incomprehensibility injected scene, after scene, after painful scene. Sean Connery gets a cane stuck through him, then lightning comes down, zaps him, and then carries him up. Why didn't this lightning bolt strike before? I mean, Sean Connery had the cane with him the whole time.  Then there's the casting. Forget the fact that this is basically Mr. Freeze with weather puns instead of ice puns, and it's being said by the great Sean Connery, the real offender of this film is Uma Thurman. Yes, Uma was in Batman & Robin also, so bad picking skills on her part, but my gosh is she miscast. The actress is from Boston, but the character is from England, and speaks in an English accent, and boy does it show. Oh wait, she also gets to fight her clone named "Evil Peel," and gets to say the line, "You just saved me from myself." Yes, that's actual dialogue from this movie. And that's one of the "funnier" lines. As for Ralph Fiennes, I don't believe he's actually in the film. It's actually Joseph in Ralph's face, because that's the quality he puts into this. Granted, his character basically gets to fight with umbrellas, drink tea, and speak in a polite British accent, but my gosh, put a little emotion into it!  It's rumored that 50 minutes was cut out of this film right before release, sacrificing a lot of the coherentness to make it a bad movie. Believe me, it was always a bad movie. There's no amount of extra scenes that could make this even a decent movie. It's at its core a bad film. What, are you going to have dialogue explaining why Steed & Peel come to Wynter's fortress in plastic bubbles? Are you going to have dialogue explaining the need to create mechanical bees? The list goes on and on, and in the end, it would have just prolonged the awfulness. As is, it's too long. So stay away from these Avengers at all costs, and go watch those other Avengers. God only knows that a bunch of superheros is more believable and entertaining than those British spies.
3 ||| I don't know what all the fuss is about.  This is a fun and stylish homage to the great TV series of the 60's.  I can't imagine any harder task than to try to compete with Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg, and face the inevitable comparisons.  No mean task, to be sure, and a brave one.  But Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are wonderful.  Of course, there are many parallels in their characterizations, but they still manage to create their own style and chemistry.  With the back-up of great supporting actors and a witty, caustic script, they make the characters and story their own.  Jim Broadbent is brilliant as Mother.  The sets are superb.  The CGI is well done, and not phony-looking.  Sean Connery is devilish.  The story is clever.  I am only sorry to that hear the producers, in response to so much negativity, cut the film a great deal.  It is edited beautifully, but I would love to see it as originally designed.
0 ||| I can't remember the last time I turned a movie off out of sheer boredom.  When my daugher is watching Elmo's Potty Time, even that show is able to hold my attention for the entire program.  Seriously - I tried to watch this movie on two different occasions and it failed to make me want to watch it thru to it's conclusion both times.  I found myself distracted by the least little thing.  Watching a bird out the window, counting how many times the ceiling fan rotated every 60 seconds,  trying to determine if this number was constant or variable, if not constant then how many rotations did it vary per minute, was there a pattern to this variation,  what's for lunch,  blt sandwich maybe?  Bacon... mmmm... bacon.....  -sorry, back to the review.  I've never seen an episode of the original TV show so I didn't have the element of familiarity to help me out - but from what I've read in other reviews similarities between the TV show and this movie are few.  Some people may say that since I haven't watched the whole movie I have no right to give it a bad review.  I say the fact that I COULD NOT watch the whole thing speaks for itself.
0 ||| Even though ten years older than myself, it is clear that director Jeremiah Chechik didn't have a clue as to what made the TV version a draw (Diana Rigg).  If you don't cast a Diana Rigg then forget doing a remake.  When Val Kilmer took on the role of "The Saint" it was casting agent Elisabeth Leustig and director Phillip Noyce (Clear and Present Danger, Patriot Games) that had the right stuff to revive a British staple of 60's television.  It should have been Noyce directing "The Avengers-1998" as well, coupled with another incredible music score of Graeme Revell.  I've no doubt it would have been DY-NO-MITE!  But it wasn't....not even close.  Keep your fingers crossed for the 2012 version.
3 ||| I bought this movie in the $3 bin at a local discount store. I then read the reviews and thought I had been had. However, I actually liked this movie. Sean Connery as the bad guy and I found it very well done with excellent picture quality.
3 ||| Great comedy, great cast, fast shipping by Amazon, everything good. So glad all the seasons of this very warm and funny comedy are finally available. No extras on this DVD, but that's OK. Now I'm waiting for them to release the rest of the Newhart series. Hope it's soon.
2 ||| In an age of director's cuts and extended additions, the irony is that the films that need restoration the most are the very ones that never get it. Thus the Weinsteins chose not to restore The Fall of the Roman Empire, MGM/UA chose not only to ignore the existing four-hour rough-cut version of Tony Richardson's The Charge of the Light Brigade but actually put out a cut version of the theatrical version and the much-troubled 1998 movie version of The Avengers will never be seen as it was originally intended. It's not the catastrophe its often portrayed, but the studio only had themselves to blame for the over-reaction by violating the quid-pro-quo relationship with the press by not screening it for the critics, a public relations disaster that lead to many publications imposing a blacklist on articles about their films for months after and picking it as their turkey of the year.  Warner Bros. 75th anniversary year was certainly not good one, with flop after flop turning their planned celebrations into commiserations. Perhaps in any other year there would have been less pressure on trying to turn an always optimistically surreal cult item into a blockbuster despite increasingly bad word of mouth, but by the time it emerged from lengthy post-production, the film was covered from head to toe in self-inflicted wounds. What had started out with a two-hour plus running time went to a 101-minute compromise cut to a released version that ran only 81 minutes without credits with Michael Kamen's original score replaced by a quickie effort from Joel McNeely as they tried to unsuccessfully make it more conventional to an audience unfamiliar with the series while alienating the original fans. It's just a surprise they didn't try to edit it down further to the length of a TV episode - even the troubled movie version of The Saint only lost its last 20 minutes. In the process they simply turned an interesting misfire into a much shorter, more confusing misfire and ended up with something too surreal for mainstream audiences, and too mainstream for Avengers fans. (The BFI was offered the chance to screen and preserve the original cut in 1999, but all too typically blew it by not bothering to return the studio's calls!)  The loss of the original (and heavily trailered) opening was certainly a huge mistake. Instead of seeing Mrs Peel (or is it?) breaking into and destroying a weather station, something that triggers the plot (a variation on both the original show's A Surfeit of H20 and Our Man Flint with a weather-controlling eccentric millionaire holding the world to ransom), the film now opens with Steed taking on policemen, milkmen and machine-gun toting nannies with only his bowler and brolly - an enjoyable enough introductory scene but not as essential to understanding what's going on. That's just the first of many plot holes the film is left with, but they're still the least of the film's problems.  On the plus side, Ralph Fiennes wisely doesn't attempt a Patrick McNee impersonation as Steed, opting for a more formal, slightly reserved approach that lacks Macnee's effortless bonhomie but works well enough on its own terms. Jim Broadbent makes a good `Mother' and Eileen Atkins (in a cameo originally intended for Diana Rigg) effortlessly steals her few scenes. But if they're all on good form, just about everyone else isn't. Indeed, there's miscasting on an epic scale here - Fiona Shaw overacting for England yet again as `Father,' Eddie Izzard exuding all the menace of a fluffy kitten and Uma Thurman delivering a turn bad enough to make you sorry they didn't cast Elizabeth Hurley as Mrs Peel instead. You feel almost sorry for her and wonder how she ever got another job after this - she can't do comedy, she can't do the accent, she can't do sophisticated, she can't do the banter and most of her action scenes hit the cutting room floor, which reduces her to not much more than a clotheshorse. That there's absolutely no chemistry between her and Fiennes is just another nail in the coffin.  Sadly it's a performance more than matched by what originally seemed the film's great casting coup. Sean Connery, once again showing the keen commercial instinct that led him to turn down X-Men, Lord of the Rings and The Mask of Zorro, gives a career-worst performance in his first role as a villain since 1959's Tarzan's Greatest Adventure and 1984's Sword of the Valiant. Looking like Windsor Davies playing a dirty old man but without the restraint, his introductory single-entendre scene with Thurman is painful to watch as she flounders and he mistimes every line - it's the kind of thing you'd expect in a Robbie Moffat film where amateur actors only get one take and it goes in the picture whether they fluff it or not. It cannot be stressed enough just how absolutely awful he is for much of the film, and considering how often Connery's double stood in for him Peter Sellers-style even on non-action scenes because of the star's feuds with the director and producer (shades of LXG) you find yourself wondering if his better moments may not even be him.  There's a lot about it that's good - the teddy bear scene is spot on and worthy of the original show while Patrick McNee's cameo non-appearance is fun - and a lot that isn't - Roger Pratt's dour photography overcompensates for the primary colors of Stuart Craig's production design and Anthony Powell's costumes. Yet while it's a mess that often stops making sense thanks to the unsubtle re-editing, it's still surprisingly watchable, with just enough moments that do work and give a hint of what could have been to keep you soldiering on through the patches that fall flat. It's just a shame we'll probably never see the film the way it was originally intended to judge it on its own merits rather than the studio's second-guessing.  Not much in the way of extras here - just  a  trailer  and som e  text notes - though the disc does have an acceptable widescreen transfer.
0 ||| I used to watch the show as teen and would catch it on A&E when it used to come on. Sure it was campy but it was fun to watch. This movie is no such luck. It was doomed from the minute the director screamed action. The whole plot involves some asinine scheme by August De Wynter(played by Sean Connery) to control the world weather. The British secret service assign Emma Peel(Uma Thurman) and John Steed(Ralph Fiennes) to the case. The story also involves plot twist where one of the head of the secret service(affectionately called "Mother") is in cahoots with Sir Wynter. When you're not laughing at the cheesy dialogue, you cracking up at the hackneyed fight scenes and the overacting by Sean Connery, who seems to have more fun chewing up scenery even though he advised people not to watch it. The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman is non-existent. The mechanical bees and the teddy bear costumes...nice. This movie wasn't pre-screened for a reason and Sean Connery did warn people not to see this movie. You can put two and two together and see the outcome. People overact like its going out of style, the humor is on par with those Roger Moore James Bond flicks and the premise is pretty juvenile. If you liked the show you'll hate the movie.
0 ||| How can you improve on perfection?  The original series with Diana Rigg was one of the best ever.  It was campy, perfectly synchronized with the oddities of 1960s design, worldview, and style, and told good, short stories.  It was a wonderful world unto itself.  By contrast, this film tries for camp without synching with the times, for an old-fashioned chemistry that it traduces (Emma and Steed had wonderful sexual tension, but everything else was implied, never shown), and for a weird yet believable story.  But it fails utterly.  This film is so bad that it is like making a comic book version of a comic book.  Not only do Fiennis and THurman utterly lack chemistry, in spite of their great talent, but the plot is simply and stupidly unbelievable.  I think that this is the worst tv-remake I have ever seen.  That answers the question:  you shouldn't try to exploit perfection by slapping together a stupid film.  Not recommended.  THere are far better things to waste one's time on.
3 ||| Yes, it looks like it was edited with a chainsaw (blame the studio). Yes, Ralph Fiennes looks like he'd rather be elsewhere. And yes, the teddy bear suits look ridiculous. Guess what? I still love it! This, my friends, is what I call a guilty pleasure. Does it always make sense? Hell no, especially since there seems to be a lot missing (judge for yourself by watching the theatrical trailer). But it's so much fun. Let me say right now that I have never seen the old television series, so I went into this movie a novice. And I was entertained. It's campy, over the top and a little silly. But it's okay. As much as I love this film, I hope someday to see the whole uncut Director's version just to fill in the (many) holes. There are far worse movies out there, trust me, and if you just give yourself over to it, you may be pleasantly surprised.
3 ||| Get-A-Way is rather silly and dated(even for 1968) and Wish You Were Here is just silly AND annoying. Other than that, I liked the rest of the episodes just fine, even the compilation Homicide and Old Lace, which had to use several season 5 scenes to pad everything out. Strange, but interesting.
0 ||| Sean Connery is an evil scientist that wants to blackmail the major countries with his evil device that can wreak havoc in the world. The Avengers must find him and stop him. Even the great Connery couldn't save this dog from the DVD discount bins in Walmart, although his performance brings the only class to this sham.  Ralph Fiennes is an outstanding actor in many other things. In this one he just missed that brilliant sparkle that the British own, and he doesn't get it. While he was brilliant in movies such as Schindler's List, this is another one of his hit and misses. I'm not very familiar with Uma Thurman, I know a lot of people drool over her, and it's obvious why. However, she also didn't have that chic magic that the original Mrs. Peel possessed.  The plot and scenery remind me of a well-made computer animation game--today's audience accepts this sort of 'near realism' but I could do without it, I would have enjoyed more thought provoking plot lines.  I wouldn't own this one but it's worth a watch on one of the premium movie channels if you're bored. I'm only hoping that another sequel isn't made, this was enough of a waste of money and film.
0 ||| I can count on one hand the number of movies that I've actually stopped in the middle because they were so bad I just couldn't tolerate watching the rest. And this pathetic movie is one of them.  I'm not sure what they were thinking, but the plot is slow, the british humor is lamer than normal, and what on earth was up with the giant Grateful Dead-esque Teddy Bear costumes??  The only thing worse than watching this movie is the fact I originally confused it with something else and didn't realize I'd seen part of it on Cable before and then ended up trying to watch it again to see if it realliy was that bad.. and indeed it was. I couldn't sit through more than 1/3 of it this time either..  No James Bond/007 here.. this is a big dud..
0 ||| With this cast and the source to work from this should have been great , but alas the shot themselves in the foot with this bomb. Next to "Wild,Wild, West" as the worst T.V. show to movie ever made!!!!!!!!
0 ||| I like bad movies sometimes, especially ones with big budgets. But all the other reviews were right, this is a bad movie! I am not a fan of, or seen many of the original "Avengers", so I had no preconceived ideas that way about how the story should go. And had really wanted to "enjoy" a big budget, bad movie. It doesn't start out to bad, but I found the lack of chemistry between all the actors to be unbearable. It's like they are all acting in separate movies, or have some sort of off screen feud going on, and refuse to talk to each other. But in the appalling delivery of lines, apparently written by someone with a severe lack of imagination and no sence of humor.   Also, if you had seen only this movie with Sean Connery, you would wonder just why he was an actor. The bear suit was not his finest hour...although pretty funny.   And I also have to wonder just why when casting this, the "supporting" role of henchman (with no lines) was given to a stand up comedian, Eddie Izzard. Known for being a non-stop talker. But of course for the one and only cuss word for the whole movie...and I swear that it's not Eddie Izzard's voice in the first place, just a dubded in word.   So finely, this movie does get a star because the location shots are not bad. And you have to enjoy the only opportunity to see a deeply respected actor(Connery), make a fool of himself in a gigiant bear suit. Other than that, if you really must find out how bad this is...rent it!
1 ||| No one was clamoring for a big-screen remake of the classic "Avengers" TV series, but Hollywood didn't listen and churned out this forgettable box-office fiasco. Despite its impressive visual style, the finished product made a good cast look terribly foolish. Ironically, the film's most positive aspect was introducing new viewers to the original exploits of John Steed and Emma Peel.
3 ||| Haven' ben able to review these yet, but looking forward to it with an older TV series
2 ||| If you have the 20th Century Fox double-sided DVD's from years ago, keep them and DO NOT buy this set as a replacement for seaasons 1-4. Another reviewer has suggested that the new Shout seasons 1-4 have "video quality beyond superior to those awful two-sided discs". They DO NOT! I have both sets (bought this set on that reviewer's comments) and compared several episodes from each season 1-4 on a side-by-side basis. They are IDENTICAL in video quality.  In fact, of great disappointment are Shout's seasons 5 and 6, which are noticeably poorer in video quality as compared to seasons 1-4. It looks as though Shout simply took the 20th Century Fox two-sided DVD's and duplicated them while slapping some old VHS recordings of seasons 5 and 6 onto their new DVD's. Shout, clearly, does not want to spend any money doing digital remastering. Additionally, this new Shout version has no subtitles in any of the seasons, unlike the original 20th Century Fox release.  Still, it's better than not having seasons 5 and 6, so I gave Shout 3 stars for releasing seasons 5 and 6, but Shout is not the high quality organization claimed to be. The seasons 5 and 6 are being released separately. Buy them instead of duplicating your seasons 1-4 with this complete series offering. Of course, if you don't have any seasons, then buy this complete series.
1 ||| I have to say that I am not familiar with the series, or had had any other contact with the characters apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" of The Avengers prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed!  Apart from the GREAT cast (Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and Sean Connery among others) and the very good acting, the plot and the dialogues are way below average!  In addition, the whole "weird" atmosphere just for the sake of being "different" and "original" just falls flat!  Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  In a nutshell, it's a weak movie; it lacks that something to make it bearable, let alone put it over the top.  No masterpiece here.
0 ||| This movie must have been done by "The Producers."  Every thing possible to make it unrealistic seems to have been done.  Steed and Emma seem to be culturally lower class people who have come into inheritances which they use to buy expensive clothes.  The actress that plays Emma would be more realistically cast as a prostitute.  The characters substitute arrogance for talent.  My favorite bad scene is where Emma is walking away from Steed and unable to see him.  She has her sword over her shoulder point to her back.  Steed hits her sword on opposite sides with his sword.  This is something the Three Stooges would do.  The real Steed would have whacked Emma's bottom with his sword.
0 ||| Let me just say that I love all the Avengers from Mrs. Gale to Tara King (for the most part) and I do love the actors of The Avengers movie but this movie stinks. It has nothing to do with the original show. First off Mrs. Peel never dealt with Mother. Mrs. Peel also did not have an on screen affair with Steed either. But Hollywood got it's paws on the story and ruined it. If your a fan of the show then you will hate this movie. I even tried to watch it a second time and just turned it off. This after Wal Mart had it for $5.00 on a discount rack. I should have been free.  Nothing in this movie blends with the real show. Nothing! I only wish that the real Avengers fans had a say with the script before they drove the image in the ground. I bet the script writer never really watched the show in the first place.  Stick with the original Avengers of the 60's. It can never be replicated. At least not in this movie.
0 ||| Being a big fan of Uma Thurman, I picked this up the other day on DVD (much to the dismay of my friends) for only $1 at a local pawn shop. I was curious see if the movie still came across as bad to me as it did when I originally saw it theatrically. Did it??? Please continue reading......  On the surface, The Avengers seemed to have all the required ingredients for a surefire summer blockbuster. You had plenty of star power in the form of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes. There was a 60 million dollar budget to spend and the movie was based on a 60's cult british secret agent series of the same name that had a dedicated and pretty sizable cult following. You also had Uma Thurman strutting around in an extremely tight leather body suit. Everything seemed initially in place to deliver an updated 90's theatrical version that could have been a cool/fun alternative to the James Bond films. But what ended up in theaters was the biggest bomb of the summer of 1998 (and of the whole year for that matter) and one of the worst films ever released by a major studio.  In its theatrical form, The Avengers was a jumbled, murky and incoherent mess that made hardly any sense no matter how hard you tried to figure out what exactly was going on. My friends and I saw it for free back in 1998 despite the fact that it had not been screened for critics (always a terrible sign) and left the theater with a very bad headache, wondering what in the hell we had just been subjected to. The worst sin that this movie commited was that besides the bizarre teddy-bear costumes (I'll get back to those later on!) this movie isn't even enjoyable on a so-bad-it's-good level.  The basic plot involves, more or less, an evil madman called Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) who has built a new weather-controlling device. The British government who has been watching his actions for quite some time. They send two of their secret agents, John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), to investigate what Sir August is up to and to thwart whatever attempts that he is making for world domination.  After the initial introductions to the two secret agents, they begin to check out Sir August's true plans and wherabouts. The movie quickly turns into a series of badly edited action scenes that fall flat every time and a series of scenes that literally make no sense at all in the grand scheme of things.  A perfect example is when John and Emma are traveling in their souped up car near the beginning (complete with a mini-coffee maker/bar), they are suddenly chased by giant remote control robotic bees. They eventually git rid of the pests, but after exiting their car it explodes for literally no reason at all. One of our first glimpses of Sir August involves a sort of meeting with some people to show off his new weather-control device. For some inexplicable reason, everyone is wearing giant multi-colored teddy-bear costumes! It truly must be seen to believed and if the rest of the movie had been as over-the-top and campy as this scene it would have been entertaining on a purely guilty pleasure level. But unfortunately, the rest of the film has the same flat and lifeless feel to it that the opening scenes exhibit.  There's also a completely unexplained subplot involving a clone of Uma Thurman running around that culminates with the real and fake Uma's batteling it out in a poorly choreographed fight in a very slow moving hot air balloon. Actually, that's this movie's biggest problem. Almost everything that happens seems unfinished and unexplained. There are some huge gaps in logic that will surely have any unsuspecting viewer screaming for someone to cut it off.  I read a while back that the original rough-cut of the movie that was test-screened with disasterous results was a little under 2 1/2 hours. Warner Bros. then demanded that the filmmakers cut the film down considerably, which they grudgingly obliged. The producers stated that the revised cut they turned in came in at 101 minutes with credits and they were actually happy with that cut. But Warner Bros. then proceeded to cut an additional 12 minutes from the film and the result was 89 minutes of terrible action scenes and no plot and logic. Do I think that the original cut would be better? It might certainly make considerably more sense, but the movie would still be awful due to some huge problems.  The acting all around is atrocious. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. Ralph is stoic and just looks bored. Uma goes through the movie in a variety of tight outfits (including the previously mentioned leather body suit), but her efforts at a believable british accent are laughable. She tries her best but it is very evident that she was not comfortable with her role and the script in any way. The rest of the cast just seems embarassed to be in this movie.  The film will probably gain some sort of cult status based purely on Sean Connery's over-the-top yet terrible performance. I thought that his efforts came across as way too forced and I've always wondered if he did this movie just to pay some back-taxes or a sizable poker debt. He's been in some bad movies before, but he's still managed to turn in a solid performance (Medicine Man and Entrapment for instance). But in this movie, he's just awful in every respect.  Special effects are laughable throughout with some particularly hilarious matte and model work during the film's climax involving a hot air balloon traveling at about 5 miles an hour and some awful CGI tornadoes tearing up an equally bad replica of London. The final battle between Ralph and Sean is also very reminiscent of Highlander 2 for some reason (in terms of how bad it is choreographed and edited).  I'm not sure what Warner Bros. was thinking with this one. But then again, they did the exact same thing with 1999's equally terrible Wild Wild West (which at least made back most of its budget). While I haven't seen many of the original 60's episodes that this was based, it initially seemed that this had some great potential to be a fun little secret-agent/spy movie, but the execution was botched from all angles. It is clear that everyone involved was hoping for an alternative to the James Bond franchise, but this movie immediately squashed any chance of that. The marketing campaign seemed to focus on Uma Thurman in that tight leather body suit, but even that isn't enough to recommend sitting through this migraine inducing disaster.  (On the DVD front, I'm surprised that Warner Bros. didn't include the ton of cut footage from the original version as deleted scenes. It would have really helped to shed some light on what went wrong with this movie. Much to my surprise, there is actually a cult following for this film that have been petitioning Warner Bros. for quite some time to release the original 2 1/2 version, or at the very least the second 101 minute producer's cut. It's scary to think that some people actually liked this movie!)  The Avengers is rated PG-13 and contains violence and language.
0 ||| In the hit or miss business called "show" and the utter lack of ideas that are being pitched to movie studios lately it was only a matter of time till "they" got their "greedy little hands" on a terrific classic TV show "The Avengers" John Steed and Emma Peel, clever scripts, plus the unrequited sexual tension between the two characters, a gem.  Ralph Finnes is so blah I wonder why he's a movie star at all.
3 ||| The problem is that I have been waiting for ever to get the last two season of the Bob Newhart Show. I already had seasons 1 through 4, but to get the last two seasons you have to buy the entire package. That is really a smarmy way of making the customer pay more money.
0 ||| Let's face it...this movie is terrible, whether or not you compare it to the brilliant sixties series.  I went in with an open mind, knowing that Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg will always be John Steed and Emma Peel.  I thought the addition of Sean Connery as the villain would be a delight.  WRONG.  The tv shows' wonderful theme by Laurie Johnson is used quietly in a couple of scenes, but the main theme is another one of those preprogrammed pieces of musical nothingness.  Uma Thurman acted like she was on Prozac and Ralph Fiennes looked like he was a little boy playing like he was John Steed. And Sean, what a lousy performance..you know you could have done better.  I did like the mechanical bees sequence; the only true original touch in the movie.  The teddy bears was preposterous and almost worked, but since the whole movie was such a drag, I'm not sure anything could save it.  Macnee was smart in his invisible cameo role.  Too bad Uma didn't back out and get replaced by a more lively Mrs. Peel.
3 ||| This is a very watchable action flick, with Uma Thurman doing what she does best - wearing something tight and kicking the bad guys around. Sean Connery goes over the top as the mad Scottish scientist holding the world ransom. Mostly, though, it's comedy of manners. Steed and Dr. Peel (that's Thurman, but her friends can call her Mrs. Peel) maintain a relaxed tea-time manner no matter what the chaos around them or between them.  I can't compare this to the original series, which aired more than 35 year ago. I suspect that fans will find this wanting. So be it. If you can take this for itself, you'll find a decent piece of humorous action entertainment.  //wiredweird
2 ||| I have pretty high standards when it comes to movies...AND TV shows, and I can't, for the life of me, see what is so gawrsh-awful about this movie. Granted, the superfeminine Diana Rigg isn't playing Mrs. Peel...and yes, dapper, veddy British Patrick McNee isn't parlaying Steed, but they did pretty well with what they had, and had a plotline that you were actually able to FOLLOW, to boot! This is something I remember the TV show NOT having...most of the stories were just platforms for Emma to be stylish in, with no clues, no O. Henry, no real DISCERNIBLE plot thread to speak of...just the barest of storylines....  The story involves Steed first MEETING Emma, (again!) and Emma being a major renaissance woman...doctor, meteorologist, psychologist, etc....the woman holds more degrees than a Kelvin thermometer!! The film opens up with Steed being tested for reflexes and skills as he strolls through a mockup of a British village. Pram-pushing nannies throw knives, pub drinkers try to run him over, bobbies attack him unbidden...he comes through with flying colors. Switch to Emma Peel's fabulous flat in London...she gets the call from the elite arm of the BSS that Steed works for after it's discovered that she, or a double of her, has sabotaged her own project.  What follows are chase scenes from hell; some VERY mannered acting; Sean Connery chewing the scenery as a megalomaniac meteorologist and businessman who wants to, what else, RULE THE WORLD...by controlling the weather. Steed and Emma go after him when it's discovered, unequivocally, that it IS a double of Emma sabotaging her project...and in fact, attempting to kill the original Mrs. Peel!  The cinematography and art direction for this film is EXCELLENT. The music, however, except for the lifts from the series, seems somewhat inappropriate and overly ponderous. There are some hair-raising chase scenes in the film, one with a fleet of mechanical, anti-personnel hornets, and Connery's acting is perfect for his role. The style of the series is recaptured nicely, especially with the villians' confab scene in teddy bear mufti in the middle of the film, and Emma wandering through what looks like M.C. Escher's summer home.  All in all, the phlegmatic bearing of Fiennes and Thurman in the face of it all remind you an AWFUL lot of the original Steed and Emma, and the climax between Steed, Emma, Connery, Eddie Izzard, Fiona Shaw, as the very teutonic-looking "Father", (supposedly one of the GOOD guys,) and Connery's henchmen is fairly entertaining.  While it may never win a spot on AFI's top 100, it IS diverting. My one complaint is...why did they have to pick UMA THURMAN...Ms. Box Office Poison herself, to play Emma? Was Nicole Kidman busy? Emma Thompson? Miranda Richardson? WHY A YANK??!! And ESPECIALLY her?? Didn't "Batman & Robin" tell them ANYTHING??!!
0 ||| To understand why The Avengers movie so totally misses the mark, you have to understand why the original Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg British TV series worked so well. This requires a bit of historical perspective. Britain in the early/mid-1960s was a culture in which long-accepted norms were threatened by powerful social forces. The youth movement was forever redefining attitudes toward authority and government, Britain was birthing a type of music that would soon sweep the world, and, particularly important to The Avengers, the women's rights movement saw many a woman demand more from her future than a lifetime of housewifedom.  When Diana Rigg's character of Emma Peel was first introduced to The Avengers in 1965, the show had already been going for several years. The character of John Steed was well-established as a conservative, stiff upper lipped, tea drinking, bowler hatted, ex-military, prime example of upper crust middle-aged traditional British masculinity. Then along came his new partner Emma Peel: young, irreverent and outspoken, sexually aggressive, dressed in provocative mod fashion AND possessed of four doctorates. Bear in mind, at this time in Britain it was almost unheard of for a woman to be a doctor at all. Not only did Emma Peel defy that convention, she did it times four.  To John Steed, exemplar of the-way-things-are-and-should-be, Emma Peel was the living embodiment of forces threatening to destroy everything he held dear, everything to which he'd devoted his life, his duty, his sacred honor. To Peel, Steed was the sort of hidebound reactionary she'd been fighting against her entire life in order to be the sort of woman, the sort of whole person her sense of individuality demanded. The great thing about the John Steed/Emma Peel Avengers episodes was watching these two very different people, each representing social forces the other had every reason to despise, over time learn to value and respect what the other had to offer, eventually even to love each other. An endless source of debate among Avengers TV fans is whether or not Steed and Peel's relationship ever became sexual or was simply platonic. Whichever opinion you embrace, there can be no doubt the love and respect were there.  The Avengers TV show was profoundly fortunate in its casting of John Steed and Emma Peel. Patrick Macnee perfectly portrayed the somewhat stuffy, exceedingly proper man of action. The heart of a noble knight in a three-piece suit and bowler hat. But as good as Macnee was, Diana Rigg's casting as Emma Peel was the masterstroke. For Emma Peel to accomplish everything she had in life before ever meeting John Steed, she must have been a high-level genius. Fortunately for the show, in real life Diana Rigg has an IQ that looks like a zip code, as well as immense class, polish, sex appeal, a strong will, and the thespic skills of a successful Shakespearean actress. When Diana Rigg played a high-level genius with multiple doctorates it was believable. I can't imagine anyone else who could have portrayed Emma Peel so well.  So that's why the original Steed/Peel episodes of The Avengers rocked. And that's why the movie is a failure, because it has none of that going for it. It could be argued the social milieu within which the TV series existed, that provoked and informed its subtext, no longer exists and so the movie couldn't have used it anyway. Maybe. But I see no evidence the moviemakers were even aware of it. The props are there, the surface accoutrements, Steed's umbrella and bowler hat, Peel's catsuit, but the conflicts and dynamic that drove the original relationship and made it something truly special are nowhere to be found.  The casting in a problem. Ralph Fiennes tries hard but is hideously miscast. He's too young, too contemporary looking, to portray a rock-ribbed conservative like John Steed. Uma Thurman, though I respect her as an actress, was similarly a poor choice to play Emma Peel. From watching Uma Thurman in interviews I get a sense of her as an intelligent, thoughtful human being, but she simply can't convincingly portray a high-level genius like Emma Peel. Thurman's Peel is more coquettish than intellectual. When Diana Rigg says she has four doctorates you buy it. When Uma Thurman says the same thing, you can't.  There are other reasons to dislike this movie, but none as important as those just discussed. A great television show does not necessarily translate to a great movie when those making the latter fail to understand what made the former great, and the two leading roles are horribly miscast. If you want to enjoy The Avengers, check out the Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg originals, and give this turkey a pass.
3 ||| WARNING:  Even though the packaging says it includes 6 trailers, There is only one.  Appearantly the other five trailers are included on a CD which is no longer part of the latest DVD release. I loved this movie.  The photography is crisp and beautiful.  And there are some Uma Kill Bill action.  If you are an Uma Kill Bill fan, you'll enjoy this movie much more than what the critics are saying.
2 ||| I never saw the orginal Avengers series, but judging by the reviews, I think I ought to.  I love Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes which is why I bought the movie, and they did a heck of job styling up their characters in post-60s mod.  But The plot was completely crap and disjointed.  Someone on the editting floor was not paying attention to what they were doing.  Nonetheless, entertaining enough to pass a boring day.
2 ||| This film is absolutely amazing.  Watch it and simply stare in awe at how terrible it really is.  Hollywood still hasn't got the hint that you do not make movies out of old tv shows.  Interestingly enough, The Avengers is a more enteraining film than Hollywood sludge like Charlie's Angels, which is 100% Grade-A Crrrrrrrap.  Why?  Because it is so bad that it actually becomes amusing, unlike Charlie's Angels or Starsky & Hutch which are just plain bad with no amusement at all.  My fascination with the Avengers is just wondering A.) What was the director thinking?  B). What were the stars thinking when they signed on for this film?  The director must be a terrific salesman, coz I don't think Sean Connery is a moron.  C).  Who gave the stamp of approval that allowed this film to be released into our neighborhood theaters?  I mean, this film had to be viewed and approved by the producers.  It was probably shown to a test audience.  How did it slip through all these cracks and make it's way out?  I think of these things as I watch this film.  You wanna see Sean Connery and his band of criminals dressed as giant teddy bears?  You wanna see America's rather shallow view of the English?(tea dispenser in car, lame attempts at British dry humor)  You want to see ZERO chemistry between the leading man and woman?  You wanna see an invisible man?  You wanna see Ralph Fiennes, normally a very good actor, trying to be cool, but actually looking and acting like a total schmuck(this goes for Uma as well)? Wanna see some of the most unexciting action sequences ever filmed?  You wanna see a 90 minute film that feels like twice the length?  Basically, do you want a 90 minute instructional video to all film students about what not to do, and at the same time chuckle a few times?  Then you can't go wrong with The Avengers.
3 ||| This movie was actually my first exposure to the Avengers, and although it has received mixed reviews, I am perhaps one of the few that enjoy this film. I do not try to compare the movie with the television series, which is why I think so many people dislike the film. If anything this is something that is unique and stands on its own much in the same way 'The New Avengers' cannot be compared with the original series. I will admit that I think the film could've been a little better in parts, I have a feeling that there are many deleted scenes from this film, and this is something that is simply begging for a Director's Cut Special Edition. Anyway, I think Ralph Fiennes does an exceptional job in the role of John Steed in that he combines the darker parts of who Steed was when the show started with Ian Hendry, with the charm, wit and sophistication on display during the Diana Rigg era.  Plus, he looks absolutely smashing with that suit and bowler hat. Uma Thurman is no Diana Rigg, but does make the role of Emma Peel her own in this film with beauty and grace.  And I thought the chemistry between her and Fiennes was excellent. I think Sean Connery relished playing an over-the-top diabolical mastermind in this film, and you can see that he was just having a ball. The special effects are awesome, and I think this film could very well be a cult classic, just as long as it isn't compared with the orignal series.  The film obviously won't be for everyone, whether or not you're a fan of the show really doesn't factor into whether you'll like it or not. I just like it for what it is, entertainment.
0 ||| This movie is easily on my top-5 list of the worst films I have ever seen.  The painful truth of the matter is that I saw this in the theater.  What a horrible memory that is!  I am a 33-year-old male, and in my entire life I have never wanted to leave the movie-house as badly as I wanted to while watching this pile of rubbish.  I have never walked out on any movie, much to my dismay.  I should have left during this one.  In fact, I remember at least 4 people leaving the theater, never to return.  One scene, in particular, haunts me to this very day.  There is a complex conspiracy afoot, and the villains all meet one last time before the crime will unfold.  They decide to wear disguises to conceal their identities.  They are all dressed in giant, multi-colored Teddy Bear costumes!!!  What?  Yes, you read it correctly.  It is so incredibly stupid that I have a hard time retelling it without my lower intestine reaching up and strangling my brain.  (Note: that last obscure referrence is from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy")  Anyway, this film does not deserve a long review, so I will now sign-off.  Rent or buy anything else, anything other than this movie.  I hope my warning here will save lives......or at least save people from emotional scarring.  Take care.
0 ||| Me director.  Make movie.  Movie have people, cars, costumes, and costumes.  And costumes.  Here plot--plot very good!  It have bad guy...and good guy!  Geniyus stuff plot.  And talking stuff wrote good too, real movie sounded stuff.  Listen, and you no throw up like some watchers... Sean Connery in plot.  In costume.  He talk.  You no throw up when he talk.  In costume.  When Ralph and Uma talk, sorry, you throw up.  On costumes.  And somebody die!  So watch and see who die.  In costume.  Me director--say, watch!  Me make good film, you like and not throw up much.  But when Ralph and Uma talk, have wastebasket ready, sorry.
0 ||| I loved the original Avengers series. It was a near flawless program; at least until Diana Rigg left.  This film bore little resemblance to that wonderful show. The original Avengers never shied away from the occasional flagrant pun or creating wonderful, almost comic book quality characters.  However, in this film, the plot meanders. Ralph Fiennes has no comic ability, and the lovely and talented Uma Thurman pretty much sleepwalks through movie. These is no trace of the quirky style that made the Avengers so special. To those of us who have seen the TV series, it comes as little surprise that several of the original program's directors went on to success in the big screen . I doubt that anyone associated with this film will find that it leads to more career opportunities. The chemistry between Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee was always a delight to watch. Sadly in the film, Fienes looks uncomfortable, and Thurman looks bored. This is a poorly conceived, uninspired waste of film. The television Avengers' unique character is nowhere to be found in this disaster.
0 ||| I got caught up in the nostalgia and hype when this movie was first released. I'm one of the few people who actually saw it in the theaters. The line that best describes this movie came from another reviewer (can't remember who): "Not only does The Avengers make you think that the filmmakers never MADE a movie before, it makes you think they've never even SEEN a movie before." That about sums it up. The film has a temporal problem - it's a 90's movie that's a remake of a 60's tv show and it's not entirely sure what decade it's in. It looks kind of 60s-ish then it looks kind of like it's taking place in modern times. The generic 60's English thugs with the mod haircuts look like they've been on ice for a few decades. Sean Connery is pretty much wasted in the title role. He's blustery and over the top, but it's mostly a great sound and fury signifying nothing. Connery's not nearly as wasted as Ralph Finnes (excellent in Strange Days). Uma Thurman shows that she can't hold a candle to Diana Rigg. She ends up in the leather catsuit but doesn't have much to do once she's in it. There are some odd bits in the middle where the movie gives a nod to some of the more mind-twisting elements of the series, but with no real effect. The cgi killer-robot bees are at best laughable and at worst downright embarrasing. The final mano-a-mano battle royal at then end is  pretty forgettable.
3 ||| Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and Sean Connery star in this film based on the 1960s television series.  Sean Connery stars as Sir August de Wynter, an evil scientist who plans to threaten the world with his hi-tech weather machine which produces such phenomena as tornadoes, hail storms, extreme temperatures, and mechanical insects for good measure.  He makes his intentions known to world leaders and tells them that they must "purchase" their weather from him at a very hefty price. Enter our two heroes, John Steed, played by Ralph Fiennes, and Mrs. Peel, played by Uma Thurman.  Steed is a Bond-like special agent working for a British counter-intelligence agency.  He and his partner Mrs. Peel have been assigned to destroy De Wynter.  Uma Thurman is excellent in her role.  From her high speed driving skills to her cat-like climbing reflexes, she's the perfect counterpart to Steed's intellect and no-nonsense approach. The special effects were the high point of the film, especially the spectacular weather effects.  The tornadoes and hail storms looked very realistic, and the final battle between Steed and De Wynter is astounding.  I enjoyed this movie for several reasons.  The special effects were the main one, but the rapport between Steed and Mrs. Peel was excellent.  The two clicked throughout the film, and Steed's continuous snide but light-hearted comments made the move that much more enjoyable.  Watch this fun film and experience some cool effects while getting a laugh along the way.
2 ||| Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay back in 1966, I was in the 6th grade and discovered Steed and Emma on TV, and I adored them. So when this film was released, I never expected it to "live up to" the originals. But I was surprised at how faithful it was to the tone and wackiness of the old series. I may be in the minority in thinking this, but I believe "The Avengers" was brought lovingly to the screen. And although it ain't the "real thing," it deserves kudos for being a noble, and even entertaining, effort.
3 ||| Chemistry is Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman (who was pregnant during the making of this). It's quite deliberate on the part of the director, but it's still enough to light up the screen. Biology is... well, Uma Thurman in skin-tight black leather. Yowza. I wanna look like that. Home Ec... or maybe Home Dec. This movie is all about style. This makes the suspension of disbelief necessary to get through this movie go down with a honey coating. Not much in the way of extras on this DVD, though. I'd have liked to see more.
2 ||| The chemistry between FIENNES and THURMAN is non existant;the special effects are programmed to keep you from sleeping;CONNERY looks bored and should retire to cultivate tulips. The funny thing about this movie is that in FRENCH the dialogue seems better. If you are over forty like me,chances are you enjoyed the BRITISH series with DIANA RIGG and her lovely boots. The sixties have never been so popular since AUSTIN POWERS,but there is a limit to the filmgoer's tolrance. This film works best on television as a time-killer.
0 ||| What a mess.  I was so disappointed by this film (especially since I invited a group of friends out to see it).  There's got to be a story behind how this movie self-destructed. And it's too bad, because, when it came out, THE AVENGERS could've out-sluethed both Austin Powers and James Bond.  It could have had the bizarre Avengers flair with the 007 intrigue and thrills. Personally, I thought Uma Thurman was a mistake as Mrs. Peel, only because the built-in audience (those familiar with the popular British TV show) would've expected an English girl. Ralph Fiennes is a great choice and Sean Connery should have been the ultimate villian. But the movie is incomprehensible. I'd read that the director was relatively new, having directed only a couple of small, independent films.  Was he overwhelmed by the massive production or did the studio take it away from him to cut it to pieces?  What makes me wonder if it was the former is that Sean Connery's first scenes have him talking with weird, exaggerated tics and such--and then they're gone.  Connery just walks through the rest of the film.  I've always heard that Connery did not suffer fools on a movie set: did he turn on his young director? I've read the script (which is available online) and I'm still wondering just what in the world happened to this film. "Mrs. Peel, we STILL need you!"
3 ||| I have seen this movie more than once and I am trying to understand the hostility it has generated. I am old enough to have seen the original TV series the first time around and while I remember it fondly, it was definitely a product of its time. What makes this film so enjoyable for me is that it is not merely trying to copy the old series but to reinvent it. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are John Steed and Emma Peel this time around. No they aren't Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg nor should they try to be. They have created their own version of the characters and they work quite well together. Their overwritten dialogue is overplayed with just the proper restraint. Sean Connery as Sir August, the principal villian, seems to be underplaying his role until you notice his eyes. Watch the eyes of all the characters. They are an important motif throughout the movie. Jim Broadbent's liquid eyes as "Mother" are full of knowledge and sympathy while Fiona Shaw's traitorous "Father" is literally blind to everything. Patrick Macnee (the original John Steed) has an important cameo as an invisible man. He holds the key to the mystery but he cannot be seen.  Director Jeremiah Chechik (BENNY AND JOON) has created a modern day fairy tale out of the old series while retaining the droll humor and the surreal touches (the brightly colored teddy bears are a good example). Much of the look of the film resembles the illustrations of modern day children's books especially THE POLAR EXPRESS. My only real complaint with the film is Eddie Izzard's use of the f-word. It is totally out of character with the rest of the film and was added solely to get a PG-13 rating. I was hoping the DVD would include the missing footage cut from the film before its release but no cigar. Sources close to the film say that it would clarify a number of points including the two Mrs Peels. Perhaps we will see it in a future reissue. So for the meantime put away your preconceived baggage and try and take the film on its own terms and you may be pleasantly surprised as I was. After all seeing is believing. Tea anyone?
0 ||| I really, really, really hope that Patrick Macnee, Diana Rigg, Honor Blackman and Linda Thorson didn't see this abortive attempt to recreate the cult British series from the 1960's. Even with the considerable talents of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Finnes, this film is just about unwatchable. Poorly edited, poorly scripted and badly directed, films like this are what make movie goers shudder whenever a studio announces they are bringing a beloved TV series to the big screen. For every adaptation like The Fugitive, there are dozens of bombs like My Favorite Martian, The Mod Squad and this dud. I am actually one of the few unlucky people to actually see this "film" in the theater. I fell asleep. So just to be fair and to have a complete impression of the film, I rented the DVD. I fell asleep twice more before I saw the entire film. It was so bad it made me wish I had fallen asleep a third time. What makes my dislike of this film so disappointing is that I so wanted to enjoy it. Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors and I was looking forward to seeing him as a villan. Uma Thurman is one of the sexiest women in movies today and I wanted to see her take on Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel. And Ralph Finnes has been in several of my favorite films, including Schindler's List and Quiz Show. However, they all fall flat in this film (although Thurman looks great in her Mrs. Peel leather outfit). The film tries to recapture the odd flavor of the series (the Connery board meeting in which all the participants are dressed as teddy bears, for example), but falls flat every time. Finnes is miscast as John Steed (too young) and he and Thurman have none of the chemistry that Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee had in the original series. Do yourself a favor. Instead of buying this waste of precious natural resources, buy the DVD set of the Emma Peel episodes of the original series. Then rent the DVD of this film -- you'll quickly see that newer, in this case, is definitely not better.
0 ||| One of the worst movies ever made. Watching Sean Connery in a bear suit while running around was ugly. The pair (Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman) have no chemistry what so ever and talk like their English. Horrible. He fights people with an umbrella and she can't fight at all. Mechanical bees chase their car and it was so exciting! Not! I hated this movie and Sean Connery lost any respect that I had for him. Don't ever drink tea again and eat your muffins somewhere else!
1 ||| i give this film two stars because although you have to question why three good actors such as these would even consider this script, they still acted well with the poor amount they got. but still, how could great actors such as these three accept such a terrible script? what were they thinking?
3 ||| Unfortunately, the wonderful episode "Escape Through Time" is paired with the clunker "The See-Through Man," but, well, you can't have everything.  They're nicely paired in one regard, which is that they're both faux sci-fi pieces about bad guys playing on the credibility of others with elaborate frauds.  "See-Through Man" is too see-through plot to maintain the suspension of disbelief, where "Escape Through Time" is far more cleverly done.  "See-Through" is largely an intentional comedy, which makes matters worse, since it's painfully unfunny  -  it's idea of humor is a comic-opera Russian idiot, who, ironically enough, is the same Russian idiot used in one of the previous season's equally spectacularly unfunny scripts.  What it does have is Diana Rigg charming her way nicely through the mess that is "See-Through Man's" script. "Escape Through Time" is by far the better piece, with Steed and Mrs. Peel trying to find out why several of England's most notorious criminals are being found dead of wounds inflicted by archaic weapons.  Seems someone is selling them the perfect escape  -  an escape into the past.  True time travel?  Or an elaborate get-rich-quick scam?  Emma goes through the elaborate plush-toy entry ritual, to find out.
0 ||| I already own seasons 1 thru 4, so I'm very disappointed not to be able to purchase 5 and 6 separately. The price of the complete set is a bit high when I only need two seasons. Not sure what to do, but I'm hoping the price will go down, or they will also release 5 and 6 at a later date. I do like the Bob Newhart Show, it was always a favorite.
0 ||| from a succesfull TV-Series and with actors like Connery, Thurman and Fiennes, they come out with this??? The Script is bad, but the editing even worse. There's nothing going for this movie, even the acting looked bad, the Director didn't have a clue of what he was doing. Don't watch this movie even if you have time to waste, is just not worth it.
3 ||| The World`s Best Agents:John Steel (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thruman) are trying to stop a dangerous man (Oscar-Winner:Sean Connery), who wants to play God by taking control of the World`s Weather. Directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik (National Lampoon`s Christmas Vacation) has made a campy action adventure film, full of non-stop thrills and comedy. This film features a Embarresment Role from Star:Sean Connery. It was a Huge Box Office Flop but Still, the movie is best enjoy, if you don`t take it seriously. Great Production Design by Staurt Craig. Grade:B+.
0 ||| First of all I'd like to put this review into perspective, I wanted so much to like this movie. I think Ralph Fiennes is a fine actor and whats more I'm Scottish and as is the custom if you're Scottish, I'm one of Sir Sean Connery's greatest fans. He was the best Bond (although Pierce Brosnan's doing a fine job) and great in movies such as The Hill, The Untouchables (even if the accent was a bit ropey), The Hunt For Red October, The Rock, Outland etc. He is a fine ambassador for his nation and the world's greatest living Scotsman by popular acclaim BUT what were you thinking Sir Sean when you made this pile of poo? Didn't you read the script? Or were you too busy banking the cheque? This movie stinks. Not because a remake of the sixties TV series was a bad idea because it wasn't. Not because the movie didn't have potential because it did. Not because the series had a cult following and the movie had a ready made audience to tap into. No it stinks because it boasts one of the worst scripts ever, with plot-holes you could drive a car through, poor editing, poor special effects, a really (...) supporting performance from Eddie Izzard and perhaps the worst choreographed and directed action scenes you could ever see. Take a bow Mr Jeremiah Chechick (also director of the fine Benny and Joon and the awful National Lampoons Christmas Vacation). The movie also boasts a fine English accent from Uma Thurman but a truly awful acting display not just from her but an incredibly wooden and uncharismatic performance from Ralph Fiennes. This movie was so bad that Warner Bros. wouldn't even let the critics see it prior to it's theatrical release but word of mouth soon spread about how bad it was and it sunk like a stone anyway. According to Total Film Magazine the movie was originally two and a half hours long and was hacked down to a mere 89 minutes for its theatrical release after a disastrous test screening, thus making Don MacPherson's screenplay (supposedly based on Shakespeares The Tempest) make even less sense. Voted the second worst blockbuster ever made by readers of the UK's Total Film magazine, this movie didn't help anybody's career but particularly harmed Uma Thurman whose previous outing had been the sequally awful Batman and Robin. The saddest thing is it could have been good and I really did want to like this.
1 ||| The rumor that shuttled around a while is that the original script stayed very close to the TV show. The people who developed the film were huge Avengers fans that spent years trying to bring this to the screen and saw it as an art house action movie. When Warner's realized that they didn't have a big budget summer film for 1998,they rushed production on The Avengers, threw a lot of money at it, and more or less told the producers they wanted a big hit. Needless to say, pandering to the masses and doing good "Avengers" are incompatible, which the test audiences more or less told the studio execs during test screenings by not liking it at all and getting confused (though I am hard pressed to see how they were any more confused than I ended up) . Unfortunately, take out the sublime strangeness and the film falls apart and makes little sense. Apparently, the studio thought they could rush this out on name power and no real story and maybe make a little money, which is exactly how much they made. Regarding the film itself, it is gorgeous to look at but painful to watch. The three leads are badly miscast (You can't replace MacNee and Rigg, though Patrick Stewart and Lucy Lawless would have been MUCH more interesting than Fiennes and Thurman) and Sean Connery chews scenery like he hadn't eaten in months. would love the DVD to have loads of extras I am sure are milling about somewhere, including commentary by the director on what happened. Stick with the TV Show.
2 ||| They could've done a lot more in the name of consistency among the episodes video quality and color saturation. Some are a little pale, some over saturated, some darker than others. But it's better than nothing. At least it's not abridged like the odd couple discs. I'm still fuming over that
0 ||| THE AVENGERS is, hands down, one of the worst films that I've ever seen (and I've seen quite a few bad ones). I went to see it in the theatres with modest expectations, and proceeded to enjoy exactly 3 minutes of it (the cool opening titles). After that, I sat in astonished silence watching this obviously grossly expensive piece of trash. The fact that one of history's most dignified actors, Sean Connery, manages to give his single bad performance to date, is only one of the negatives on display here. THE AVENGERS occupies that strange void where it's badness can't even be laughed at. This movie is pure trash, and there are very few movies that I heatedly dislike. If you're reading this review and actually plan on buying this movie, I recommend you save your money. I'll never understand how such talented actors and such a large budget can create such disposable junk. Avoid this movie at all costs. Consider yourself warned.
2 ||| This big screen productio based on the tv series took alot of hits from the critics-some of it justisfied. However i found this movie to have some redeeming qualities. First of all you had several high quality actors such as Uma Thurman,Sean Connery and Ralph Fiennes. They seemed to be doing a pretty good job but were asked to work with a pretty weak script. I found the special effects and cinematography to be pretty good also. The character interaction was very weak with very little attention given to the reason that Sean Connerys character for instance had such an infacuation with Mrs Peele-that is just one of many weaknesses i found in this film. As stated by film critics one of the main selling points was a chance for Uma Thurman to have her own fashion show(which in itself is not a bad thing).Others critcize it for being so campish and the constant silly banter going on between Mrs. Peel and John Steed. However, give it some credit for trying to stick to the formula that won the original tv series its loyal following. Anyone that follows those episodes will probably agree that this movie more or less stayed along those lines. Anyway,this is another of those movies that i can't really say why but something keeps me popping it back in the dvd player and watching over and over again.
0 ||| Wow.  I thought I was in for a treat when I saw the previews for "The Avengers."  At least the previews were entertaining.  The beginning of  the movie started out pretty good, but it was downhill from there. Can we  say, "movie turns into a fashion show?"  For crying out loud,  every single time Uma left a scene and came back, she had on a new hot  little number for an outfit.  If I wanted to see a fashion show, I would  have stayed home and turned on my cable. I absolutely love Ralph  Fiennes and Sean Connery.  Most of what they have done I have found  wonderful.  I was sorely disappointed by Sean Connery's role in this movie.  His lines were stilted, he seemed extremely uncomfortable in what he was  doing, and I started to feel sorry for him midway through the movie.  Was  this supposed to happen?  I don't know. I do understand that this movie  was supposed to represent the quirkiness of the original TV show, but I  didn't buy it.  Perhaps it was starting to grate on my nerves every time  Uma showed up in a different tight-fitting outfit. The special effects  were about the only redeeming quality in the entire movie.  The bubbles  they walked in, those big mechanical bees, and the high-flying act at the  end were all pretty dang cool.  I just wanted more out of the characters.  I wanted more out of the plot.  I wanted more out of Sean Connery's  villain.  I wanted more out of the relationship between Uma and Ralph.  Perhaps I wanted too much, but when coming right down to the nitty gritty,  that's usually what the criteria is for making what most people consider a  "good" movie.
0 ||| Shout hasn't released Rhoda season 5 so I have no hopes of them doing the right thing and releasing Bob's seasons 5 & 6. Capitalism. The only way to make them do right is through consequence. By not purchasing their products.
2 ||| Though an ultimate disappointment to AVENGERS fans, and especially to viewers being first introduced to the AVENGERS mythos, the film at least takes a while to show its bad side.  The opening 45 minutes is  smashing-which is perhaps why the ending is so frustrating. The main  reason for this let-down is not the ridiculousness of the plot. MISSION  IMPOSSIBLE, most Bond films, and even JURASSIC PARK have all had commercial  success with plots that weren't much better than this.  Rather, the failure  of this film comes in my mind from Sean Connery.  If this were the only  example of his acting one had ever seen, one would have difficulty seeing  how the man ever won an Oscar (R).  His performance is truly abysmal.  Yes,  the situations he's placed in and the lines themselves have a certain  hollowness to them, but all meglomaniacs in all action films are, well,  silly.  Though I do think one or two scenes exploring a bit more of de  Wynter's character might've been in order, films have been more satisfying  with less-scripted villains.  The glaring difficulty is that Connery  obviously doesn't *believe* in his character.  It's absolutely obvious that  he's not having fun-even with the good lines.  As a result, we don't  either. By contrast, Fiennes and Thurman are having the time of their  lives, playing roles that seem to have been tailor-made for them, despite  having originated with other actors.  There are really no scenes which  their presence doesn't immediately help, and one can't help but feel that  if the movie had simply had a different actor cast as the villain, their  chemistry would've gone better appreciated by the viewing public. (DVD  notes: There are really no additional features on the DVD, which is  surprising.  The production team were all huge fans of the TV show and  spent years trying to bring this puppy to screen.  One would've thought  they'd have been absolutely passionate about trying to explain what had  been a big part of their lives for years.)
2 ||| --and that's why it gets three stars. Part of the fun of this film is filling in the blanks where, if the trailer is to be trusted, there may have been explanatory scenes. (Speaking of the trailer, my dvd has only  one, despite the "Six Theatrical Trailers" advertised on the  packaging.) E.g., Good Emma and Bad Emma are obviously "enhanced"  clones created by de Wynter, whose wife was the template--her huge portrait  hangs in his mansion. (This is not to claim that I've untangled all of the  film's apparent flaws.) I also enjoyed the pervasive umbrella imagery,  'cause brollies are neat. And I've never seen the original tv series, but  I gather that many of the elements in the film harken back to particular  episodes.
2 ||| I was a fan of the original TV series when the A&E network aired it back in the early 1990's.  I waited with much anticapation when I started to see photos of the film.  Then came the trailer.  WOW!  I couldn't wait  to see the film.  But to find out that the folks at Warner Bros. didn't let  advanced sneak peek for critics to see this, you knew something was wrong.  So there I was waiting to see this and found out how horrible the reviews  were.  When I finally saw the movie I thought scenes were missing.  What  does this mean?  We were jipped!  False advertising from the WB!  The  movie to my mind is OK, but all the missing scenes were in the darn  trailer!  There were really absurd moments (the Teddy Bears were the  funniest to the audience at the theater).  I thought the worst was the lack  of explanation for Bad Emma.  How did she come to be?  The original Steed,  Patrick Macnee reduced to being invisible?  It'd been great to see the two  Steeds side by side.  Uma was OK but sure looked uncomfortable doing a  British accent.  She looked great in the leather outfit though!  Ralph as  Steed I thought was the best acting in film.  Seemed a more silent, maybe  dark Steed?  Connery as the villain was OK but his objections should've  been more realistic.  The Alice character seemed to me the highlight of  this film for something that worked.  The movie did seem to be a combined  mixture of a couple Avenger episodes. But to adapt it as the 1960's was  wrong. They should've put it into the 1990's.  The movie is OK and for that  it ain't so bad.  The missing scenes are needed.  Mrs Peel, we're needed to  find the complete film print edition!
0 ||| A Movie that just tries to hard to be clever & succeeds only in making the film worse and driving the viewer closer & closer to despair. Plot - Well not Much can be said for it since it really was awful, Did you care  what happened? Did anyone come across well? No!  The shame was that the  potential was there but unforunately this mix of a typical Hollywood Plot  & the sureallism that was attempted failed dismally. It's a pity though  , I felt that Thurman & Fiennes made a good Steed & Mrs Peel, pity  they had nothing to work with.
1 ||| Why does Hollywood waste its budget on movies based on 50's, 60's, or 70's TV shows?  Can't anybody think for themselves anymore?  Films like these give good actors bad reputations, and Ralph Fiennes, Sean Connery, and Uma  Thurman are great actors.  The three of them must've been trying to hang  themselves after the theater release.
3 ||| I think this is one of the best sitcoms of the '70s.  The cast of characters were all excellent in their roles and the humor was not like the juvenile crap that passes for humor now on television.  When I saw it was being released on video I pounced because I think this was Newhart at his best.  His show as the innkeeper had some funny moments, but not the wit of this show.
0 ||| I've read the various comments to the effect that the complete series is a good value at $80, and that SHOUT FACTORY should not be held accountable for  the actions of FOX.  1. SHOUT FACTORY was more than well aware of the history of the series release. Why did they choose to release the entire series rather than seasons 5 and 6? Would they have us believe they felt the majority of individuals inclined to purchase the Bob Newhart sat out the first 4 seasons in the hope that SHOUT FACTORY would come along and release the entire series at a great price? They new quite well that fans already owned the first 4 seasons, and bet that they would pay a hefty price to get the remaining two. Their offer to release seasons 5 and 6 now, after numerous complaints, is a bit lame.  2.$80 is a great price for the series if you don't already own the individual seasons, but where is this market? Most fans who are inclined to by DVD'S of the series at all, have already bought one or more seasons. Individuals who are not familiar with the show and would like to "try it out", may buy one or two seasons to see if they like it. I doubt they would spring for the entire series.  3. Fans are being unfairly faulted for "jumping the gun" , and purchasing the first 4 seasons as they were offered. We believed that the studio would act in good faith , and , in time, release all 6 seasons. They didn't. Had we not purchased the seasons when they were initially offered, further releases would have been concelled in any event.
1 ||| Despite what other reviewers are guessing to be true, the video quality of the episodes in seasons 1-4 in this complete series set is NOT an upgrade from the original DVD season releases. I have done an extensive side-by-side comparison and the transfer is unquestionably inferior with the new set. Colors are washed out, detail and definition are reduced. It's a very stark contrast. The video bitrates are markedly higher for the old discs vs. the new. I'm noticing bitrates that are as much as 30% higher in the head-to-head comparison.  Perhaps most importantly, there is for some reason a significant variation in quality from episode to episode in the new set. The last one or two episodes on each disc are consistently and inexplicably much lower in quality than the other episodes on the disc. This is not the case with the older set. Take Season 1, Disc 3 for example: it contains eight episodes, and the first six average around 1.03 GB in raw size. But the last two episodes ("Bum Voyage" and "Who's Been Sleeping on My Couch?") come in around 780-800 MB. If that 30% difference doesn't sound bad to you, trust me when I say it is very noticeable, particularly with a 40-year old series shot on film. The older discs have no such variations in quality; the same episodes in that set consistently come in around 1.09 Gb each. Size isn't always a true indicator of video quality but in this case it holds true. Many episodes in the new set  just look plain bad, like they have been through an additional transfer generation or two.  However, the "Complete Series" set is the only way to get your hands on the final two seasons, so if you own the older discs, my recommendation would be to make your own set with seasons 1-4 from the season discs and 5-6 from the new set. I can't comment on the bonus features as I haven't viewed them yet. But the episode commentaries are all still here and there doesn't seem to be anything new in that department.  Another difference that may matter to you: the new set does not include subtitles, whereas the old discs have both English and Spanish subtitles. It seems Shout! Factory left them out as part of their misguided effort to cram as many episodes on each disc as possible. I'm no fan of the double-sided disc format Fox used for the season releases, and it's a pain to switch the discs more often with fewer episodes per disc, but I'll take them over the new set any day.
0 ||| Tiresome, absurd, and senseless plot, but the kiddies might enjoy it for the special effects and cartoon like action sequences.  I wish I could say it was the worst movie I've seen in awhile, but the Mod Squad has that  honor.  A total disgrace to the original TV series.
0 ||| As a fan of the original Avengers t.v. series I have to say that I was so excited when this movie was previewed with what I thought would be an outstanding cast that I can hardly contain my displeasure at how  predictable, boring and stupid this film was.  Although the performances  were credible the story was so bad that I wish I could get the price of  admission back. Save your money.  Trust me!
0 ||| I already own seasons 1 - 4 and like many others have been waiting for 5 & 6. I can continue living a happy life without buying the complete set of 6 seasons. Feels like extortion to me. I am not going to buy it this way!!!!
0 ||| I've been weary of something like this happening. Roseanne and Cosby were released in their chopped up syndicated versions instead of the original... which version are these? Also... It's really great that this series finally came out completely... but what about those of us who YEARS AGO  bought seasons 1-4... waited patiently for the rest... and want the rest of it? Do we just chuck out DVDs we paid as much as $49.95 a piece just to get the last seasons?
0 ||| I've already purchased seasons 1 through 4 as many other people also have. Now I'm informed that I cannot buy seasons 5 and 6 separately! That means I have to spend $80 which amounts to $40 per season to get the last 2 and get stuck with the first 4 seasons again.  Well I guess that means I won't have seasons 5 and 6!
3 ||| I always liked this show when it originally aired.  Bob Newhart is at his best playing a low-key everyman that quietly reacts to all the lunacy that surrounds him.  In this series he plays a psychologist which is a creative way of introducing some quirky characters for him to respond to (not that his friends and co-workers aren't quirky enough themselves).  The show ran out of steam the last couple of seasons when supposedly Newhart wanted to end the series but was talked into staying. It is still a fun show with a lot of good memories.
0 ||| I knew I had to see it as I am a fan of the TV series.  It's almost as if the writers watched a few old episodes, picked up a few ideas and threw them into the script.  Absolutely NOTHING worked, the daft things Steed did (like the tea making  in the car) worked in the TV show because it was done with style; in the  film it came over as  pathetic.  Uma Thurman is no Diana Rigg; she can't  act and was totally inept.
3 ||| all was good to see
0 ||| I have to second everyone else's emotion.  This is unfair that we have to buy a whole box set to gets seasons 5 and 6 when most of us already bought 1 - 4.  I am very disappointed.  I have been diligently waiting for a long time for the rest of the series.
3 ||| Box set won't be out for another month or so, but I'll go out on a limb, and predict greatness.  Hope they cleaned up the transfers. The original releases of the first 4 seasons were pretty poor.  There's nobody like Newhart. Watch and see.  ADDED: To the various dissenters (crybabies) who think they have to buy Seasons 1-4 again, Shout plans on selling Seasons 5 and 6 separately. So, be patient, and stop whining.
2 ||| It's a real shame to give this DVD set a 1-star rating, but I have to.  I've spent a lot of money for seasons 1-4 (about $100 I figure) and have waited many years for the final two seasons.  The decision to require people like me to repurchase the first four seasons to see the rest of series is reprehensible.  It's a wonderful show - Thank you Bob Newhart, et al.  But the marketing of this product is insulting to many.  UPDATE:  Due to the fact that seasons 5 & 6 have been released separately I will add an extra star to my rating for each season, bringing it to 3 stars.
2 ||| Shout is an amazing company that gives old TV series a real boost in cleaning up the picture and audio. I have the Fox releases and I hated the audio. I will gladly double dip for those four seasons and the two remaining seasons. Thanks Shout!  ***Update June 3, 2014***  Picture and audio quality - no different from the FOX releases. That's sad. I am mixed on this set and am changing my five star review to a three star.
3 ||| Too bad the Avengers series are no longer being made. Netflix use to stream it but no more. If Amazon could snag the series I might reconsider Prime. I use to watch this as a little girl and it brought back a lot of fond memories
3 ||| Like the Avengers and Mrs. Peel.... English humor,,, price reasonable .... still interesting stories and colorful characters price is affordable and play well
3 ||| Representing the Early Black and White Episodes, you cant go wrong for vintage sexy retro British Spy T.V.!  "Mrs. Peel" and John Steed are ever the sleek, elegant crime fighters from a different age.  And theres always champagne at the end...Cheers!
3 ||| It was a good show.  I did, however think I had ordered the Newhart Christmas...but this program was okay too. Enjoyed it.
0 ||| I love the series but already own first 4 seasons and have been waiting YEARS for rest of series.  Now they only offer as full set.  I will not be buying the full set to get only the last two seasons.  I hope no one buys it so that the company gets the message that this is an unfair practice.  Makes me not want to order any more season sets of any show because they release a few to get us hooked then expect us to buy the whole series.  Kind of the same thing with Diagnosis Murder.  I guess it's bad form now to buy individual seasons and better to just wait until series has run it's course and wait for a "whole series" release.  I'm tired of getting burned by buying early seasons only to be duped in the end when the final season are not individually released.  We need to send a message to the people making these DVD sets.
0 ||| The Bob Newhart Show is one of the best shows of the 1970's era... great comedic timing and timeless jokes/lines. I was delighted to see that shout factory picked up bob newhart after all these years of waiting...but then my heart sank when I saw it was a box set. Its mary tyler moore all over again. For those of us who already own the first 4 seasons this is unfair. If we band together like we did for the mary tyler moore box set shout factory may break up the bob newhart set for all the customers who already own this wonderful tv series up to this point. GREAT show!
0 ||| Ho-hum!!! What good can be said about this movie except that it takes the mantle of "Most Wretched Action Movie" away from "Batman Forever". No chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman, both are great  actors, but horribly miscast. Even poor Mr. Connery looks weary of it all.  Plotting is tepid --I dozed through the middle of it-- and the only good  part is Uma in that leather catsuit *mrrrrroooww!!!!*Look, save your money  and just buy any of the boxed sets of the original series. They rock! And  Ms. Rigg looks better in her catsuit anyway!!!
2 ||| This is a film to watch for the sheer audacity. It has the merit of being extremely unpredictable, and bizarre. Patrick MacNee makes an interesting cameo in one bit. Fiennes and Thurman look positively glum throughout,  thinking they'll make a lot of money and run. The set pieces and special  effects, however, are fine, especially Big Ben exploding(ha ha!). Sean  Connery makes an entertaining villain . . . although he can make almost any  film he does watchable, that guy is a REAL actor. But on the whole, if you  want to see a film featuring everything from baddies in teddy bear costumes  to mechanical wasps(that's right) to Uma Thurman in a cat suit(it looks  nice on her actually) and an equally daft and strange plot, then this film  is for you. Total mind candy, but at least it's enjoyable in its own way.
2 ||| I watched the original series with MacNee and Rigg (and even caught Honor Blackman in it). It was cheeky, weird and campy. All these elements make the transition to the big screen version. What's missing is the soul of the  television series. I'm not sure, though, that the original would play  well today without some updating. Like many things from the 60's, it was  something very much of its time. Look at the Connery Bond films...they  wouldn't be as accepted today as they were then. The time frame within  gives us a context. Without the context, the material doesn't always work.  The original series for all of the well written episodes had episodes that  were poorly plotted messes. Like the Star Trek series of films, the past  seems to add an luster to these dramas that they don't always  deserve. Still, the original series was always a cut above the average  American television programs. It was always witty and the cast, more often  than not, could pull off the show precisely because of their charm. This  along with the bizarre elements that would crop up in the scripts made The  Avengers always good fun. The film doesn't completely pull it off, but  there are moments that work as well as the original series. Fiennes  brings his own intrepetation to Steed. To have expected him to play it like  MacNee is pretty unrealistic and it probably wouldn't have worked. The same  goes for Thurman. However, for me she's the weak link in the  cast. Connery plays his part over the top. It works precisely because it  worked in the original series. Expectations can be daunting and this film  had too many expectations. Time will soften the blow...
1 ||| They are clearly gouging by not offering the final 2 seasons separately. There is NO excuse not to. It's no secret people are hungry for the final 2 seasons, we have been waiting for 6-7 years and it's clearly documented. They are just taking advantage.
0 ||| i love the avengers...of course i'm talking about the tv show.patrick macnee and diana rigg were always charming and sly,making the plot almost secondary,but always interesting.now on to the movie....mr.fiennes and  ms.thurman are neither charming or sly,and neither they nor the plot is  interesting. even sean connery,the BRILLIANT sean connery,who has given us  such memorable performances in such movies as:the rock,medicine man and,of  course,bond,james bond, this time just gives us a headache. the basic plot  is that sean,playng the villian,sir august dewinter(subtle) wants to  control the weather. the sad thing is even after you watch the movie,you're  not really sure why. there's also an "emma peel" twin on the  loose,and poor patrick macnee as the invisible guest. don't ask me to  explain it,really...it's just so...i can't even say contrived,that would  give the plot too much depth..it's more like a defrosting refridgerator  with the food left in. and is it just a coincedence that uma has been in  the two worst films of all time,("batman & robin" being the  king,and this coming a close second!),or is this a case of the odor in the  elevator every time she's in it. i don't know,but all i do know is,DON'T  WASTE TWO HOURS OF YOUR LIFE ON THIS!!!!not even connery could save this  one.
3 ||| Set is in fairly good condition. It skips through two episodes on one disk. I will try to clean and fill the disc and I expect it to work fine. It was said to play well and I do not consider that to be playing well.
3 ||| I really enjoyed the first and third episodes.  The middle episode looked too corny right from the start, so I skipped it. A mixed bag, but consider it if you can get it at a decent price.  I don't know why Avengers DVDs are so expensive!
3 ||| Many passionate Jane Eyre fans hate this adaptation. I have read the book more than once and I rather liked this version-- it doesn't maybe glorify the story to the fans, but it does accurately represent what the book looks like to the rest of us. The fans get upset about inaccuracies, but these are all just details. The essence of the Jane Eyre story is captured in this movie. An unhappy single woman falls in love with a rude cranky older guy. Turns out the guy is married, but it works out. There is beautiful scenery involved and a big house. Some spooky scenes. The production is lavish and the actors excellent. Ciaran Hinds may not be the dashing hunk Rochester of legend, but he is the older man of the book. Sometimes I wonder if the Jane fans are mixing Rochester up with Teen Wolf.  And Samantha Morton makes an elegant, attractive Jane. Recommended.
0 ||| The DVD had a small crack in it, and would not play.
2 ||| Imagine having your favorite book cast by two of your favorite actors for film. To me Hinds and Morton had exactly the right look for the characters. I've enjoyed the depth of their acting in other projects. They are both wonderfully talented. I anticipated this version with eagerness.  Alas reader,  the screenplay. What were they thinking? The spirit of the piece was way, way off in key scenes.  Jane is rolling her eyes at times and they both speak so abusively to each other for a lot of it. The first meeting was like that, very nasty to each other there.  But what really was off was Hines  yelling  all the time.  I heard his radio take on Rochester and his characterization was much calmer with more control. This Rochester is more bombastic than likeable. Seriously, I cant see what attracts Jane to him! These yelling torrents ruin key moments like that first meeting for example.  However, the stay with me scene (after the aborted wedding) was the worst. He was actually horribly bullying and abusive here. He throws things, he hurts her. He blames Jane for not excepting his view. He excuses himself with a "What was I supposed to do, tell you the truth?" kind of attitude. As she leaves he's calling out "That's right leave, its just like you." WHAT is he talking about?? Rochester is supposed to be heartbroken  NOT hateful. It was hard to watch such a total bolt away from the novel here!  And what's with all the open mouthed "kissing" when he proposes? (By the way, he yells here too!)  But there were scenes I really liked.  His confession of his past life to Jane is well staged and poignant. Watching the sunrise together was nice. When she just returns to Thornfield from visiting the aunt (that we never get to see-one moment she leaves the next she returns). The scenery and sets are all very pleasing. I especially loved the camera work during the party scene where Jane is remembering Blanche and Rochester singing. Bertha was a hoot. Shopping at Milcott was good, except for the insertion of Blanche there, Rochester is actually nice to Adel at times. Also, the ending, though the dialog is not exactly from the book, was extremely touching. They are both excellent in this scene. And a postscript scene with children and voice over was a nice touch. These are excellent actors. It would, I feel, been first rate to have these truly talented people in a better adaptation.
2 ||| A lot of reviews of this set were great, especially the episode that related to picture (Queen of Sin). I've been an Avengers fan since its original airings, & I've always found Miss Peel right attractive, but Queen of Sin is the worst episode I've looked at on DVD so far. Her outfit is not really that sexy, & the story to that episode was absolutely lousy (& loud). If you're buying individual sets & not the whole Emma Peel megaset, then skip this set; don't let the cover fool you. The rest of the episodes in this set are better however, so if you're making complete year purchases, then buy this set too....you decide.
3 ||| So far, My Favorite Production of a well-told Story.
1 ||| These are some of the best shows I've seen. I'm a big "Avengers" fan and have episodes back to the Honor Blackman days. No doubt that Mrs. Peel and Steed were the best duo to tdo the show. I recommend their episodes to anybody.
0 ||| This DVD would not play on my machine even though it's designed for Blu-Ray DVDs.  Additional the only subtitles were in Spanish.  I had to return it.
2 ||| Not my favorite Jane Eyre version...Mr. Rochester was a bit too rough for the character. Samantha Morton did superbly!
1 ||| This movie is good, but entirely too rushed. It would have been a very good idea, in my opinion, it have at least put captions letting you know how many years passed between particular scenes. With it not being this way you miss much of the power of her story. However, no screen adaption is ever perfect, and given that decades of Jane's life are covered in an hour and a half (thus the benefit of captions) the movie adaption is about as faithful as you can do.
3 ||| Good movie.
0 ||| After years of owning the book, I finally got around to reading it a year or two ago.  Besides this particular adaptation, I've seen 6 others: '11 movie, '06 mini, '96 movie, '83 mini,'73 mini, and '44 movie. While I believe the story line (500+ page novel) is better suited to a mini series length; I quite enjoyed the latest ('11) movie- despite its being only 2 hrs. long!  As for this particular one:  Don't be fooled by its title, this production is far removed from the book (so if you've never read it, and are seeking an authentic adaptation-- look elsewhere)! The only things that the two have in common are the names of its characters, and a few sequence of events! 95% of the dialogue has been rewritten (and butchered), and some events made up!  Rochester is an insufferable, maniacal, beast of a man!  With a constant scowl on his face, and a snappish bark of a tone. How Jane could have felt anything beyond oppression and disdain is beyond me! Jane's character is even altered; she's borderline bratty, somewhat mouthy, and unreservedly opinionated. Beyond any and all comprehension she actually loves Rochester (despite his blatant mistreatment of her- especially when she's about to leave)!! ..Thankfully it was only 108 minutes long-- anything beyond that would have been torture! _________  If you're entirely new to this story, please get acquainted with the book before or after viewing! If you're not a fan of reading (or listening to an audio book), and you'd rather watch an adaptation- I recommend looking into the 1973 or 1983 BBC miniseries. While these earlier productions are a bit dated and theatrical/stagey, they are the most faithful to the book.  As for the latest mini series, the only real advantage it has compared to the '73 & '83 renditions, is that it has the modern cinematic feel/experience (meaning the acting & sets aren't as stiff and theatrical). In my opinion however, it's the weakest adaptation to date.  The dialogue is more modernized, certain events unfaithfully re-written, and the relationship between Rochester & Jane overly romanticized (when compared to the book). If time is a factor, the movie I recommend is the '11 (although be advised it begins at chapter 28 in the book, and then goes back to Jane's beginning).  There are a couple of deleted scenes that add more background to the story, so you may want to check them out.
2 ||| I love Jane Eyre and I have tried to watch every version there is to see how close to the book they are.  Cirian Hinds and Samatha Morton are favorite actors as well.  However, I thought this production of Jane Eyre was lacking.
3 ||| I like Samantha Morton as Jane Eyre she portrays Jane as the solom young lady that she was in the book. Not expecting much from the world but determined to make out there. I was not real crazy about Edward Rochester he seemed to be a little to harsh from the character in the book
1 ||| I thought this would be the movie that didn't cut out some much of the book when Jane leaves Mr. Rochester. It barely shows the time she spent away from him and her growth as a woman.  I might try the BBC version because it looks longer and might actually include more from the book.
0 ||| This version is the 3rd that I have found to have fallen short of the mark.  This one is more likeable of the 3, but still not the best.    Ciaran Hinds does his best, but it's his delivery.  Any way, it's not one that I want to add to my Jane Eyre collection.    I can, however, recommend the Timothy Dalton 1983 Version as well as the Toby Stevens 2006 Version. They are fabulous!
3 ||| They finally got two interesting actors for the lead roles in this movie adoption - I enjoyed watching it - they really played their parts well.
2 ||| I am puzzled as to why the director, producers, and writers of this so-called adaptation of Jane Eyre decided to stray so far from the actual novel by Charlotte Bront. Not only were several key scenes deleted, they chose to put in words and scenes that were never in the book. So why did I give it a three-star rating? Well, this is because of the wonderful acting by the main characters.  Samantha Morton, whose luminous beauty is portrayed subtly here, plays plain Jane Eyre, whose intellect and high moral character is wonderfully and credibly depicted here. Mr. Rochester is played by the consummate Ciaran Hinds who first impressed me in his performance as the lead character in&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Mayor-of-Casterbridge/dp/B0000AQS3P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Mayor of Casterbridge</a>&nbsp;and who delivered a finely nuanced performance as the once thwarted in love Captain Frederick Wentworth in&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Persuasion/dp/B001DUDKEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Persuasion</a>. Both actors deliver credible, compelling performances and the age gap is certainly true to the novel, though many of the dialogue and scenes may not. The chemistry is believable, though not the best of all the adaptations.  If you watch closely, you'll recognize several other familiar faces in British period drama. The wonderful Gemma Jones from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Duchess-of-Duke-Street-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B001ADXWYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Duchess of Duke Street - The Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sense-And-Sensibility/dp/B0019TYQ38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sense And Sensibility</a>&nbsp;as Mrs. Fairfax, Elizabeth Garvie from 1980's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pride-and-Prejudice-The-Complete-BBC-Miniseries-VHS/dp/B00004WG2X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pride and Prejudice: The Complete BBC Miniseries [VHS</a>] as Diana Rivers, and Rupert Penry-Jones of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/White-Chapel-The-Ripper-Returns/dp/B005G172Q8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">White Chapel: The Ripper Returns</a>as St. John Rivers.  The cinematography is beautiful enough though the score is forgettable, and ultimately, I would rate this as one of the weakest adaptations of Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre. That being said, I would still recommend watching it if you're a fan of Hinds and Morton and also if only to do some comparisons with other adaptations.
3 ||| Not surprisingly, the reviews of this movie are all over the board.  I have to say that I think the actors playing Rochester and Jane did a great job.  Rochester has been described as a screamer, and while I can see why people say that, Rochester IS a very emotional character.  I didn't find that a problem.  I did find the language and liberties taken with some scenes unfortunate - I am not against modifying dialogue to help the flow of the movie, but too many liberties were taken here!  That being said, I really, really enjoyed this movie.  I enjoyed seeing a short Jane Eyre, and all the stuff that was cut out were the things that you tend to want to hurry through when you're reading it anyway.  In fact, I have been guilty of skipping through Jane's childhood in one or two of the versions that I own.  :D  This movie also totally skips the whole issue of Jane gaining an independence, which in the grand scheme of things, doesn't really matter too much to the meat of the story.
0 ||| I'm frankly surprised that this "version" has so many positive reviews! While I love the book, I'm not what you would call a "purist".  Besides this one, I've seen 6 others ('11 movie, '06 mini, '96 movie, '83 mini,'73 mini, and '44 movie). While I believe the story line (500+ page novel) is better suited to a miniseries (length); I quite enjoyed the latest ('11) movie- despite its being only 2 hrs. long!  As for this particular one:  Don't be fooled by its title, this production is far removed from the book (so if you've never read it, and are seeking an authentic adaptation-- look elsewhere)! The only things that the two have in common are the names of its characters, and a few sequence of events! 95% of the dialogue has been re-written (and butchered), and some events added (made up)!  Rochester is an insufferable, maniacal, beast of a man! How Jane could have felt anything beyond oppression and disdain is beyond me! Jane's character is even altered; she's borderline bratty, somewhat mouthy, and unreservedly opinionated! Beyond any and all comprehension she actually loves Rochester (despite his blatant mistreatment of her- especially when she's about to leave)!!  In conclusion, if you dare watch this insufferable abomination, you had better have a pair of "frownies" on hand; Rochester's scowl is that infectious!  ..Thankfully it was only 108 minutes long-- anything beyond that would have been torture!
2 ||| Jane is an orphan who first becomes a teacher at the rather grim school for orphans where she was raised, then takes a job as governess for a little french girl who is the natural child of a cranky Mr. Rochester. She can't help loving him, and eventually he is equally in love with her, in spite of the attempts of a wealthy neighbor to hook him. They plan to wed, and are at the altar when a man gallops up to the church and announces that the wedding must not take place.  From there you have to either read the book or see the movie; I've told you enough already. Modern audiences will be shouting at her not to be such a prude, but this is Victorian era, after all. And the girl has guts, which finally serves her well. The movie is well done, but it's a pretty bleak story.
3 ||| This is a loose version, some things were added that were not in the book, much was left out.  but a book such as this would have to be a mini-series to remain true.  That being said, I like this version.  Ciran Hinds never disappoints, and is so handsome.  Yes he's stiff in the movie, but so was Edward in the book.  I like it, and will probably buy this version, maybe.  still a couple more versions to see before I select one for my personal library.
2 ||| Hard to understand at times.  Not on par with Downton Abby.
3 ||| this show was the talk of the town  when it fist aired.  It will always be a classic.
0 ||| This would have been a very good version of Jane Eyre except for the terrible miscasting of Mr. Rochester. Mr. Hinds simply isn't a romantic lead in any way, shape or form and his Rochester is nowhere near adequate. Its so distracting that I just couldn't believe the relationship between them. Jane wasn't plain enough for the role. Excellent actress though. The role of Jane calls for an actress that can look really drab most of the time then glow with animation at other times which changes her whole face.
3 ||| I love this version, although I am biased because it was the first adaptation I had seen.  I adore Ciaran Hinds as Mr. Rochester, and although Samantha Morton captured the fairy quality of Jane Eyre, I never felt she represented the fire she had inside, and there is little chemistry between the two actors onscreen.  Having said that, this condensed version of Jane Eyre moves very quickly, is never boring, in completely enjoyable to watch, and truly captures the spirit of the novel. (SPOILERS AHEAD): the scene when Jane leaves, crying, and you hear Edward call out that this was the purest love, and he should know, he's waited long enough for it, it's just heartbreaking.
0 ||| I have seen all the Jane Eyre versions and this one is by far the WORST of all of them! This is the only Jane Eyre version I would never own or buy or even want as gift. The acting was mediocre,not one of the best. Even the latest version that came out this year,that I thought was 'ok', was 100 times better than this one.  I don't know why this actor Ciaran Hinds was picked to play Rochester. I spent the entire movie wondering what Jane saw in him. He was neither attractive nor charming in any way or likeable. I can't find anything good to say about his portrayal or this version. I was not able to sympathize with him at all. I thought either Orson Wells or William Hurt were the worst as Rochester but I could not be more wrong. I can not think of a worse actor to play Rochester than this man. I didn't care much for this actress as Jane either or Adele. I think the dog Pilot was the best actor in this movie. I would not want this version even for free.
3 ||| I enjoyed this movie version except that Jane played by Samantha Morton was not the strongest Jane. Jane is a solid and strong inside herself type of person. I love the 'look' as Jane but her acting is just not there. It is like she is too faint and disembodied in the role. Jane is a substantial person with depth. Samantha captures the fairy unworldy part but never is strong and resounding in her performance. It is almost like the role was too much for what she had inside to give to it.  Ciaran Hinds on the other hand carries this version.  He is a GREAT Mr. Rochester! I love the novel and have various movie versions; I was totally surprised by him. He totally carries the flick! With the exception of the kissing scene where he reveals his feelings for her after she returns from being away - the side of the face fake kisses (don't look!).  How did they let all THAT stay in the final? It was so entirely awkward. Forget that part when you see it as it was a total disaster.  But, I was totally surprised by how great he was in this movie.  A good look for him as I did not care for him much in the Jane Austen adapation of Persuasion.  I very much like Gemma Jones who plays the best Mrs. Fairfax; this version fills in the blanks as far as did Mrs. Fairfax know what was going on?  This is the only vesion that does so.  I say this version is good for Jane Eyre fans; Mr. Rochester is what makes it good, not Jane.
3 ||| If you are a devoted Jane Erye fan you may not like this movie .If you like a romantic movie then you will enjoy this  one I really thought hinds was the Rochester that Bronte was writing about personaley I did like this movie .
1 ||| I love the book and the 1983 adaptation with Dalton and Clarke is my favorite.  I told my husband years back (then just a bf) how much I love the book and movie and he gifted me this without knowing anything about different versions out there.  I was not even aware of this adaptation myself back then and was curious to see what this Jane Eyre had to offer.  I was horried to witness Ciaran Hinds screeching and screaming all the time like he was having a never-ending PMS.  And let me just say I love Ciaran Hinds.  He is a truly talented actor, amazing in Persuasion and Phantom of the Opera, not a one-note actor by any means.  I don't understand what could possibly happen here.  Did he so grossly misunderstood the character?  I cannot beleive it.  I am  blaming the director (and maybe editors?) for misguiding him into making such a travesty out of Mr. Rochester.
2 ||| On a scale of 1-10, this Jane Eyre is a 5, maybe 6.  While Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton are talented performers, this version is just overall lacking. Ciaran Hinds come off as a little too brutish for my taste and certain parts are rushed through.  While one cannot expect a 2 hour movie to encompass every detail of a novel, it is expected that the production team keeps to original novel to a certain degree, which is not the case with this one.  A better JE is the 1974 Michael Jayston/Sorcha Cusick JE, the 1983 Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark JE or even the 2006 Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson JE.
2 ||| although poorly directed, the casting is good.  I was certain Mr Hind could be a good Rochester from his understated performance in Persuasion.  However the characters as protrayed in this version of Jane Eyre badly need more "understatement" .  Emotional restraint does not seem to have been demanded of them... or perhaps the director thought this film could be called Jane Eyre with no need to be at all true to the  tone of the book.  Such in-your-face emoting simply turns the film into a sloppy pot boiler. And probably embarasses even the well chosen cast
2 ||| I'm a big Jane Eyre fan, and the book is one of my favorites; thus, I've seen most of the different versions of this famous classic. I loved Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke (I thought the dialogues and Dalton's portrayal of Rochester were unforgettable) and Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson (I loved the chemistry between them) versions. I was hoping that this adaptation was also great especially with Ciaran Hinds in it. However, I was somewhat disappointed. I understand that this version is much shorter than above mentioned adaptations, but still not showing such important scenes like aunt Reed deathbed confession or not giving any explanation who St. John and his sisters (in this version only one sister) are to Jane were disappointing. Also I thought that the scene with Jane and Rochester meeting Blanche while on the way to shopping was useless. However, if you are not familiar with the novel or other adaptations you might like this one. It's basically poor governess falling in love with a master of the house. I gave it 3 stars because of the beautiful scenery, costumes, and settings, and also I thought that Jane and Rochester's age difference was more appropriately portrayed than in other versions. If you're not familiar with Jane Eyre story, I would recommend that you pick up the book or watch Dalton/Clarke version (it's most faithful to the novel) before watching this movie.
3 ||| Admittedly, this is a truncated version, which is not entirely faithful to the novel.  If this is a problem for anyone, this is not a version for you (many others to choose from).  However, I cannot help liking just about anything with Ciaran Hinds in it.  IMO, he IS Mr. Rochester.  I also loved Samantha Morton as Jane.  I kind of just wish that they used these same actors and plugged them into a more full length miniseries, rather than a feature length film.  Jane Eyre really needs to be done as a miniseries.  That said, this is a workable, enjoyable version well worth a view for Hinds and Morton.
1 ||| I found this interpretation of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre good. One need only view various interpretations, such as the 1944 Orson Welles film, starring both himself and Joan Fontaine, to appreciate this 1997 version. Twentieth Century Fox's wartime genre encapsulates the studio art department with very poorly executed visuals in the 1944 film. One knows without doubt that this was made in Hollywood. However, each version is different, with different characterizations,style and pace. This 1997 original A & E version is good stylistically, the lead characters give earnest interpretations, but seem a bit caricatured and one-dimensional. I have read the various reviews praising the Timothy Dalton version and cannot for the life of me understand the praise. He is entirely too wooden and one-dimensional. One does not even perceive the character of Rochester, with its depths and nuances, in his portrayal. The best film Jane Eyre thus far, in my opinion, is the BBC 1973 version with Sorcha Cusack and Michael Jayston, also available through Amazon.com. Read my review on this version. It lacks the sumptiousness of the latter entries but the acting is first rate. This 1973 version has been unanimously hailed as one of the best interpretations of Jane Eyre.
1 ||| This "Film" version of the classic story by Charlotte Bronte is grossly overacted by Ciaran Hinds. Personally, I found him to be too harsh and cruel, barely even nice. However, Samantha Morton balanced it out quite well as the title character, though. I also didn't like the omission of the middle scenes with Mrs. Reed, which I feel are very important to the story. I prefer Timothy Dalton (4 years before he embodied the role of James Bond in "The Living Daylights") as Rochester. He was very well suited to the part; I read somewhere that he considers his role as Edward Rochester his personal favourite. Gemma Jones ("Sense & Sensibility") was great as Mrs. Fairfax. If you're looking for a faithful version of "Jane Eyre," I highly recommend the 1983 BBC miniseries starring Timothy Dalton, the 1944 version starring Orson Welles or the 1996 version starring William Hurt. This film version is Not Rated.
3 ||| good
1 ||| Some are in Black and White and some in color. It often stalls. I guess the DVD version has some compatibility problems. The sitcom itself is SLOW. I do think I would have enjoyed it - not in a memorable way - but for the day if there hadn't been so many technology problems. I should have and may still send them back as they are basically unviewable unless you have the patience of Job.
2 ||| Having read Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte in high school and having viewed many version of Jane Eyre, I believe this version is not the best or even the second best - and hence, not worth a person's time or money.  My reasons are as follows: (1) The film is too short, leaving out too much of the novel. For instance, it completely skips Jane's conversation with her Aunt Reed when her aunt is on her deathbed.  (2) The acting is not as good as might be desired. The actors playing Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester just do not have the correct chemisty. (Disclaimer: I must admit that I always liked Timothy Dalton's performance in the 1983 BBC version, so my judgement might be impaired)  (3) The film does not develop the relationship between Jane and St. John Rivers nearly as much as it should have. Hence, it might be difficult for the viewer who has not read the novel to realize what a difficult choice Jane must make when she decides to refuse St. John's offer.  I recommend the following:  (1) Jane Eyre (1983) with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke - a BBC production totaling 311 minutes  (2) Jane Eyre (2006) with Ruth Wilson (II); Toby Stephens - a Masterpiece Theatre production totaling 228 minutes  Note: However, I enjoyed this version more than the Jane Eyre (2003) Miramax production with  William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg.
3 ||| yes
2 ||| This version is bad in so many ways. First of all the movie is too short to relay the entire Jane Eyre novel and to touch on all of the key elements of the book. Jane herself is boring and emotionless, asks too many questions and incredibly bossy. Rochester is alright, except his barking tone in several scenes and his somewhat lusty attitude towards Jane. Rochester's and Jane's romance develops too suddenly without giving it the proper time to build up, thus they have little to no chemistry. Many important things are not included in the book such as Jane learning of her rich uncle and receiving her inheritance after meeting the Rivers.  New and rediculous scenes are created such as Rochester and Jane running into Blanche Ingram in town while shopping for their wedding. Blanche herself is unattractive and too nice. Most of the people in this movie act out of character. Seems like the writers and directors forgot to read the book or decided to create their own story of Jane Eyre. Skip this and watch the 2006 version.
1 ||| I think that Samantha Morton's Jane Eyre in Robert Young's 1997 TV adaptation of the great novel, could've been the best screen Jane ever. Morton was 20 years old and the closest in age to the young orphaned governess, childlike in the appearance but strong willed, serene yet very intelligent with acute sense of right or wrong. Two years prior to her Oscar nominated role as a mute girl in Woody Allen's "Sweet and Lowdown", Morton proved that she could say a lot by the mere look at her face, by her impressive and speaking eyes alone. It is sad that the film took too many liberties with the book and not only in omitting many important plot lines in order to fit in its 108 minutes length, but with too many changes to the very nature of the novel's two main characters and their relationship. Jane in the scenes with her employer is sometimes too demanding and not as tactful as she is in the book. The changes are especially obvious in Mr. Edward Rochester as he was played by Ciaran Hinds. Hinds is a talented, intense actor but I can't agree or like his reading and interpreting of Mr. Rochester's character. Some his scenes in the film made me cringe. Mr. Edward Rochester of the novel was not yelling or rather barking brute - it was difficult for me to believe that Jane Eyre would come to love so much. I also was unpleasantly surprised with Mr. Rochester openly displaying his affection for Adele. This manifestation was against the logic of his character.  2.5/5
1 ||| I have it in my Jane Eyre collection and the chemistry is not believable at all.  Ciaran Hinds is barking at her the entire time. There is no inflection in his voice that would give way to you believing he had a soft spot for her on more than one occasion. He also didn't have Mr. Rochester's dark wit.  If you want to see Ciaran Hinds in a wonderful movie, see Jane Austen's "Persuasion."  Samantha Morton, although a great actress here, played Jane far too impertinent for her position, the era and most importantly for the post-Helen Jane who had a gentle spirit that made Mr. Rochester drawn to her in the first place.  I was glad to see the Bertha portrayal was very close to the book in this one as well as the 83' version.  Unlike, the most recent Masterpiece version that had Bertha looking like she could step out of Thornfield, put on a gown and walk the red carpet.  If you want to see a great and TRUE adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's "Jane Eyre," watch the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version  which still is powerful even after 24 years. Timothy Dalton is the book's tumultous, playful, introspective and passionate Mr. Rochester. Zelah Clarke plays Jane perfectly as unworldly and innocent and knowing her "station" so to speak, but also having her own mind. The 83' version wasn't Hollywood's version, it was Bronte's version.
0 ||| I didn't care for this version at all. I thought there was no chemistry between the two leads, and there should be at least some smoldering of repressed emotions. The story was so abbreviated so as to seem just a conventional, brief story of thwarted love--the character development, especially of Jane, was missing in action. No heartbreak, no horror, no sense of Jane's virtue, tough interior and self-reliance, which helped her overcome so many of life's obstacles. Not even much atmospheric scenery. This Mr. Rochester, played by the usually-excellent Ciaran Hines, is utterly forgettable, weak, and miscast. He doesnt have to be handsome, but he does have to be powerful, passionate, sexy, and seething. After all, he keeps a mad wife locked in the attic and he tries to keep that secret while almost commiting bigamy.  Instead, try the Timothy Dalton version which is excellent though now a little low-budget looking,  or the 2007 even sexier and faster-paced version with Toby Stevens and Ruth Wilson, which is outstanding and the best yet. It moves right along, and yet it keeps all the story essentials.
2 ||| I have this version of "Jane Eyre" on VHS, and I like it, but can't understand all words, which is why I'm wanting it on DVD.  I agree with one reviewer who disliked Ciaran Hinds' overacting as Mr. Rochester.  However, I'm interested in this version because of him, and Samantha Morton.  Samantha is amazing to me here, as she, if you can believe it, also plays timid little Harriet Smith in Jane Austen's "Emma" (A&E version).  What a difference in personality and character!!  And so convincing!  And Ciaran Hinds plays Wentworth in Jane Austen's "Persuasion" with Amanda Root as Anne, and of course, he's nothing like Mr. Rochester.  Both "Emma" and "Persuasion" mentioned above have sub-titles.  I haven't checked yet to see if this version on DVD of "Jane Eyre" offers sub-titles, but if it doesn't, I'll be terribly disappointed, and will not purchase it.
2 ||| i've seen my share of adaptations of this great story and i'm convinced that there is just too much going on to be able to fit it into 108 minutes of film. still this is pleasurable and i would give it 3.5 stars if allowed.  if given a longer production and more loyalty to the book, i could imagine this would have been a particularly wonderful adaptation. ciaran hinds and samantha morton are wonderful as rochester and jane. i really enjoy watching their performances. i can feel their frustrations and passions. their conversations are powerful although condensed. hinds is an amazing actor, and i enjoyed his portrayal. morton - although hindered by a short script/movie - was excellent. i am convinced morton's portrayal of jane eyre is the best out of all the adaptations i have seen. this makes it particularly disappointing that she (and hinds) were not allowed to fully incorporate all the details of the book, spread out over hours of film. ah yes indeedy, that would be sweet.  so i think the only 'problem' i have with this adaptation is the length and the resulting lack of true-to-book dialogue and story-lines somewhat external to the rochester/jane focus, such as her prolonged visit to her dying aunt, and the real way she met up with mr. rivers and his sisters, and how she inherited a fortune from her uncle. of these ommited or condensed things, i especially miss the grand debates between jane and edward. it doesnt allow the viewer to fully experience the chase, to savor their growing desperate love and passion. (the dalton/clarke 1983 version and the jayston/cusack 1973 version both are long features which follow the book much more closely, if that is what you are looking for.)  however, the condensed story and deviations from the book do not take away from the actor's performances. for example, i found the final scene particularly wonderful. when she finds him a broken man, and he tries to cast her off for her own good, she refuses, and he cries for all his past pains and and present joys. hinds, as i said, is amazing.
0 ||| This out of all the many versions of Jane Eyre has to be my least favorite... Granted Samantha Morton has  a very  adorable fairy/ Elfin like face like Mr Rochesters Description of her, but her acting has  no highs and lows. She stands up to Mr Edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers, seemingly no respect to her employer, which is not fault of  hers, the writing of the script is bad.... and so the direction. Ciaran Hinds  is totally over the top. He is so angry with no understanding, his eyes are  very lustful and at times  crazed.  He is not at all like the character  described in Brontes epic book of a very sad and  tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with the  innocence and singular personality of earnest, honest and yet strong sweet  Jane Eyre that Charlotte Bronte brought so vividly to life with her classic words.   The over acting of both during the proposal scene is almost comical. To me there is no love, feeling  or chemistry here between the two actors just lust.... He seems to be going through a middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl, and she though supposedy a virgin...  she dosn't act like one.  Plus this movie  seems very rushed you can never get a good foot hold of the story Especially during Janes childhood. I do also miss the Gypsy scene that is omitted in many of these movies and was expertly done in the Dalton /Clarke mini series, which brought some brief light heartednes to an otherwise very dark story.  If you want to see great versions. I  highly rate the 1944 movie with Orson Wells though it is another abreviatd version, that movie truly captured the spirit and feel. It is moody dark and mysterious. Another is the fantastic Timothy Dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the movies taking actual lines right from the  Brontes story.  Dalton's and Clarkes acting is simply superbly sublime!  However if you are like me, see them all and make your own decision. They all have something to offer and most are entertaining...
3 ||| I really like this version of Jane Eyre.  Fans of romantic/historical movies will enjoy the detailed sets and costumes as well as the high drama.  Fans of the novel will appreciate a script that's true to the book without ploddingly recreating it word-for-word or--just as bad--peppered with anachronisms in an attempt to make Jane Eyre hip and modern.  Samantha Morton brings Jane's underlying strength of character to life and Ciaran Hinds, as Mr. Rochester, does very well with a character that can easily be overplayed to the point of silliness.  They are supported by a strong cast, including Gemma Jones as Mrs. Fairfax.  The overall production value is as high as the caliber of the acting.  This is a good, strong production, though I do wish that the DVD came with some extras.
2 ||| This is a so so adaptation of the novel into a film. I suppose they had to cut certain plot elements out while creating a motion picture screenplay and I appreciate that. This is a MOVIE not a book in moving pictures. But still, there were a few things that could have made the film even more fantastic and wonderful:  1.) The replacement of Mr. Brockelhurst as head of Lowood school would have been a happy incident in this dark film. It would have satisfied the desire for such a wicked man to get his just desserts.  2.) There was no point changing the character of St. John Rivers who is supposed to be stoic and unemotional to this engaging, flirtatious character in the film. It only made her rejection of him bittersweet since he had been nothing but kind to her from the beginninig.  3.) Why couldn't they show her coming into the 20,000 pounds from her uncle. This happy coincidence is something that can only happen in a film and they should have taken advantage of it. She can end up RICH AND HAPPY.  The plus side is that I suppose JAne's suffering is not as prolonged as it is in the book. There's just enough suffering to not make it insipid. Also, the actors who play Mr. Rochester and Jane do a really good job as do the rest of the cast. There is a lot of using the eyes and body to act not just words. I adored the music which made the whole thing really melodramatic and everything such a novel from such a literary period in such an adaptation should be.
3 ||| This was the first version of Jane Eyre I had ever seen and I enjoyed it very much.  There was a chemistry or "passion" between Jane and Rochester.  Samantha Morton played Jane better than anyone to date.  Jane had personality which I think she lacks in other versions.  I thought Ciaran Hinds as Rochester was wonderful.  He was very close to how I imagined Mr. Rochester in the book.  Not handsome but rugged and likeable.  He did tend to be a bully somtimes and that was a negative but he also had a tender side that came out through his facial expressions in a number of scenes between he and Jane.  A few negatives I found with the film are: 1. this version doesn't stay true to the book, much of the dialogue between the characters is rewritten, 2.  sometimes Rochester is a little too angry and 3.  I wish it were longer so that more of the book could be included.  I loved the ending and had butterflies watching it.  I found the passion between the actors moving and can easily watch this version again and again.  If however, you want a version of Jane Eyre that keeps closer to the book, then the Timothy Dalton version (1983) is a better choice.  It too is very good but is a bit dated (I felt like I was watching a play rather than a movie).  Ideally, I would love to see a production of Jane Eyre that is as well done as the A&E version of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.
1 ||| I'm not going to repeat the plot, nor am I going to go on and on about comparisons with the book.  This is just a critique on this version of JE.  I've seen the others, and this version isn't bad, it's hilarious.  I've never laughed so hard at an adaption which is supposed to be a tragic but uplifting love story.  Oh, let me count the ways....  First, the Jane Eyre character, played by Samantha Morton.  I thought she appeared to be a bit of a vindictive, spiteful, co-dependent girl.  She is a "Heather" in Victorian dress.  However, I think she was the perfect for this version of Mr. Rochester.  Oh boy.....  I LOVE Ciarn Hinds, I love his range, his voice, it's a doggone shame that the scriptwriter, director made his character laughable.  Yes, his mannerisms are cringeworthy, and his 'attraction' for Jane, bordered on sexual harassment.  The character's lust for life, and vigor appeared to be a bipolar disorder.  The part that made spit out my water at the TV screen, the scene after he and Jane first shared a passionate kiss.  After we hear Jane narrate how she imagined the kiss or that moment, here comes Mr. Rochester.  Jane addresses him as "Mr. Rochester", and he has an expression of perverted that only Austin Powers could love.  He whispers, "Edward."  I was waiting for him to wink, wink, nudge, nudge and wiggle his eyebrows.  If you're down in the dumps, this version will make you shake your head and perhaps laugh it off.
0 ||| This version was awfully butchered.  It felt like I was fast-forwarding through the entire novel.  The actors were fine, but the dialogue they were given was so trite that I found myself wincing through most of it.  The script lost a lot of the novel's "punch" and intensity.  This DVD is definitely going into the Salvation Army bin.  I couldn't sit through it again.  My favorite version of Jane Eyre is still the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton - good dialogue, fine acting, and great film score, plus at 311 minutes the original story remains pretty much in tact.  I also love Timothy Dalton's version of Wuthering Heights - never a dry eye at the end of that one.  Beautiful, haunting film score.
0 ||| The characters have the same names as the novel but that is about as far as this version goes to stay true to the characters in Bronte's Jane Eyre.  I've watched many versions of this classic novel, and this is by far the worst.  Ciarn Hinds, who I usually love, plays Mr. Rochester as a raving lunatic, not a tortured man who's life has been turned upside down by an unfortunate mistake as a young man.  There is no chemistry between the characters and the dialogue/plot differs so much from the novel it is a travesty to call this 'Jane Eyre.'  I threw away this DVD after watching it.  A waste of $$$.  Buy the Timothy Dalton version for a true 'Mr. Rochester.'
0 ||| I really disliked this version of Jane Eyre, so much so that I found myself skipping parts and pulling the movie out before finishing it. I infinitely prefer the William Hurt adaptation of the novel.  First off, the film quality and color of this film were very poor. It was washed out and altogether too bland. Also, the acting was poor in my opinion. Samantha Morton was not very believable as Jane Eyre and the actor who plays Mr. Rochester was altogether unappealing. The two actors had no spark or chemistry to speak of, and the relation of love by Mr. Rochester later in the film is wholly unbelievable and poorly delivered. He ruins one of the best lines in the novel (the one with the bit of string tied to his heart and Jane's). Also, although Mr. Rochester is not handsome, this actor was just uglier than I had imagined Mr. Rochester to be. But, that would be of little account if he also did not portray Mr. Rochester as just plain rude. He ordered about Jane in a brutish manner, levied insults, barked out his lines and was very dull. Why Jane would be attracted to him (beyond being lonely and not having the company of any other man) is beyond me. The portryal of Jane was also a dull one and her constant voice overs were really annoying. A film is supposed to show us the story, not tell us the story. There was far too much telling of Jane felt or about her past, and far too little demonstration. I was told Jane loved Mr. Rochester, but from watching the film I found that very hard to believe. Jane also seemed to be rude and disrespectful on purpose, rather than observant and forthright as she is in the novel. She doesn't mean to offend, but truthfully answers questions and speaks her mind. The movie would have you think she is just catty. Also, she always looks so annoyed with Mr. Rochester.  Overall, I regret buying this film. I wished I put my $5 dollars towards the William Hurt adaptation which more accurately captures the emotion and spirit of the novel, if not all the exact details.
2 ||| With two such fine performers as Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton, and with Charlotte Bronte's masterful story, I could not believe that this version of Jane Eyre would be anything but enjoyable.  Sadly, I was disappointed.  I think the problem lies with the screenplay. A complex story was reduced to 2 hours, which meant that key plot and character development had to be sacrificed.  Hinds and Morton just did not have enough to work with.  Stick with the Timothy Dalton version, it is far better.
3 ||| I can't say that this version of Jane Eyre followed the storyline closely.  Because of time constraints, large chunks of the novel had to be cut out or streamlined.  This includes not only some key plot points, but a lot of the best dialogue between Jane and Mr. Rochester as their relationship develops.  That said, I still think this is an enjoyable film, so long as you enjoy it in its own right and don't compare it to the book.  Both Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton commit to their roles with passion.  Like the characters in the novel, neither is conventionally beautiful; they are riveting because of the emotional force they bring to their parts.  At times, Hinds was a little too gruff as Rochester, but it never went over the top; he looked the part of Mr. Rochester and in my opinion acted it incredibly well.  And Samantha Morton is luminous - she may wear plain clothing and sport a ridiculous hair style, but she shines.  I did dislike some of the belabored dialogue the screenwriters introduced though.
2 ||| I wish someone could comment on the picture quality of the DVD.  I have purchased about 20 DVD movies and rented countless more, and I thought all of them looked just fine.  This is the first one I have come across whose picture resolution/sharpness resembles that of a slightly worn-out VHS tape. As for the movie, Samantha Morton was a wonderful Jane Eyre and Ciaran Hinds was a pretty good Mr. Rochester. Knowing what I know now about the DVD, I might still have bought it because I love this version of Jane Eyre and don't have it on videotape.
2 ||| I recently caught this on cable and was excited to see it; after all, "Jane Eyre" is one of my favorite books of all time. While Samantha Morton made an excellent Jane, I thought Ciaran Hinds was terrible as Mr. Rochester. He was far more blustery than smoldering, and the scene at which he screamed at Jane while she drove away disturbed me. He seemed more like an abusive boyfriend than a man overwhelmed with pain and passion. Also, some of my favorite scenes were cut. Where was the scene where Jane went home to visit her family? She left and then came back again; we saw no part of her interaction with the Reeds, which was one of the best parts in the book. She also never learned of the inheritance left to her by her uncle in Madeira. And I agree with the reviewer who said that the part with St. John and Diana might have been left out for all the weight this movie gave it. Overall, this is not an awful movie. However, it is inferior by far to other productions, notably the version with Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt.
3 ||| Yes, I've read Jane Eyre, for the first time when I was twelve.  And, yes, I liked the book.  But this movie isn't the book and I liked it as well. One thing the movie did very well in the beginning was to condense years of abuse by Jane's aunt and Mr. Brocklehurst into a few key horrific scenes that also point out the affection that Jane felt for her friend Helen, the few kind teachers and later her pupils. Ciaran Hinds as the hero begins with a great deal of roaring and bluster, but here and there are hints that this is a screen he uses to protect himself from the pain of intimacy.  The key to Mr. Rochester's character is in the scene in which he tells Jane about his "grand passion" and how he was betrayed by the woman he adored.  Juxtapose this against the first Mrs. Rochester's passion for him that overset her reason. Samantha Morton does a lovely job of portraying an innocent who is not ignorant of the darker aspects of human nature-- Lowood School taught her more than reading, writing and geography.  Her plummet into the pain of the truth and then her coming to understand the power of the passion that grips her is very well played. If I want to re-experience my version of Jane Eyre I will reread the book.  That does not mean I cannot enjoy another interpretation of the story.
1 ||| I must fervently disagree with the many positive reviews shown here, for 2 major reasons.  First, the writers took great 'liberties' with the novel that detract, rather than enhance, the characters.  The best two examples involve the main characters of Mr. Rochester and Jane.  In the book, Rochester is a brooding, singular figure who is very much a victim of the cruel plotting and vices of others.  But in this film version, he is cruel and vindictive in and of himself.  Vengeful, plotting, and profane, you have little reason to see why Jane would ever attach herself to such a worthless creature.  Jane of course does fall in love with him, but because he is so repugnant, the viewer can hardly see any reason why.  Thus, Jane is herself reduced greatly from a woman who loves unconditionally - -as was shown in the book- -to a strange, misguided young woman racked with a codependent psyche.  The second area in which this version is inferior to the book, and the other far superior film versions (particularly the William Hurt version) is its brevity.  It is only 90 minutes long.  It leaves out so many of the small aspects that would normally give vitality and life to the characters.  Being that it is such a poor version, this is not necessarily all that bad, but willing to give the film chance after chance to redeem itself, it falls terribly short on nearly every measure.
1 ||| Jane Eyre is one of my very favorite books, so I simply cannot like a film version that leaves out important details.  I liked it when I first saw it, but had the nagging feeling that something was missing.  So I re-read the book, and discovered exactly what was missing -- about 1/4 of the book.  Among the scenes that were missing were the other reasons behind Jane's return to Thornfield. And then there's Samantha Morton.  I cannot think of a film where I liked her, so that is another strike against this version. Some have said that Timothy Dalton is "too handsome" to play Rochester.  Perhaps he is.  But he is such an incredible actor that I will forgive him. *grin*  I do appreciate Ciaran Hinds, and it pains me to say that I did not like him as Rochester. I read someplace that he hadn't read the book before making this film.  Well, it shows.  He rants and raves too much; there was no subtlety in his performance.  And subtlety is something Dalton understood in his performance. An adaptation does not need to be a word-for-word translation from page to screen, but it does have to retain the spirit of the original for me to appreciate it, and this version does neither, so I cannot find much to like about it.
3 ||| Well, I  just watched this movie today again after not seeing it for a couple of years and again I loved it. No, it is not as true to the book as some other versions, but it captures the spirit and tells the story in a very compelling, moving-it-along way. I enjoyed the rapid transitions, cut-aways and voice overs. It tells the story of the novel in a most interesting way. I think Samantha Morton makes an excellent Jane Eyre. She really captures Jane's innocent yet vibrantly alive spirit. Morton exudes the very fairy-like, impish qualities that Mr. Rochester is always describing her as having in the book. I think she is the best Jane I have see portrayed although I do enjoy Charlotte Gainesborough's and Joan Fontaine's work as Jane as well. Ciran Hinds did equally as well. I think the two actors really displayed the chemistry that existed potently between Jane and Rochester. This kiss under the tree was remarkable! The settings and lighting in this version are much better than in the 1983 Timothy Dalton version. And although Hinds is quite handsome in Persuasion, he actually becomes the more unattractive Rochester in this movie. Dalton, although a powerful performance in the miniseries in which he played Mr. Rochester, could never really be considered "ugly." Hinds is a more credible Rochester and very true to Charlotte Bronte's novel. I highly recommend and enjoy this version of Jane Eyre. Although not as true to the book as other versions, I think it included the most crucial scenes in a most convincing way. It was truly a fresh look at a classic and timeless novel.
1 ||| Got a little bored with it
1 ||| I've read the book (10 times) and seen all the movie versions.  The "Jane" in this video was unbelievably haughty and unattractive.  How in the world did Rochester ever fall in love with her?  When they kiss in the movie there is the "chemistry" (mentioned in other reviews), but lust isn't what the book is all about.  All my favorite passages were cut out or adulterated beyond recognition.  This would be a terrific disappointment to any one who really loves the book.
0 ||| why the screenwriter decided to ditch all the most famous dialogue and many of the most pivotal scenes in this extremely pedestrian "Jane Eyre". All lost are the Aunt's deathbed confession to Jane, the buddha-like teachings of Helen in the hellish Lowood school, the gypsy fortune telling scene that infuriates Blanche Ingram, and even the chestnut tree cleft in half as a manifestation of God's displeasure! No sign either of "He saw that the boy had inherited his own eyes as they once were: large, brilliant, and black"--that's one of the most famous lines in English literature, for crying out loud!! I was more disappointed than I can say to see that Ciaran Hinds, so wonderful in "Persuasion", was so terrible in this. And Samantha Morton as Jane was even worse. There wasn't a hint that she had lived through the childhood Jane Eyre had to become the governess Rochester encounters in the mist. Please, if you have never seen "Jane Eyre", don't make this sorry mess your introduction to that magnificient novel. Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine did such a better job of it!
1 ||| I was so excited when I heard A&E was doing "Jane Eyre," especially when I heard Ciaran Hinds was cast as Rochester. I thought that was perfect casting and that I would see something of the caliber of "Pride and Prejudice." I was bitterly disappointed! What a travesty! My main objection is that the scriptwriter decided she could improve on Charlotte Bronte. Instead of sticking to the words in the book as closely as possible, she completely rewrote the dialogue. What arrogance! The result is that both Rochester and Jane say things that are completely out of character to anyone that's read the book. "I feel your passions are aroused"? I found myself screaming at the screen "he'd never say that!" My second main objection was how Ciaran Hinds was directed to play Rochester. I blame the director because I've seen Hinds in many movies and know the range of emotion he can display. In this version he was essentially one-note: he shouts all the time. The ONLY time he softens is in the bedroom with Jane after the fire. That one scene showed me what could have been, and only sharpened my disappointment with the rest. What a sad waste of what could have been a marvelous production. I did like Samantha Morton's Jane best of all the Janes (I've seen every version of this). I just wish she'd been given better dialogue to speak. The Timothy Dalton version remains my favorite. Too bad Hinds and Morton didn't have that script and that director!
3 ||| Welles did such a definitive Rochester for me, exactly as my mind's eye saw him in the novel, that it is hard for me to appreciate anyone else in that role.  However, George C. Scott did a very good, very restrained Rochester in his later version and this version presents a very good Rochester as well.  Morton as Jane Eyre confirms my earlier opinion from her performance in "Sweet And Low Down" that she is an actress to watch.  As far as faithfulness to the novel, I really don't demand that from films which are a very different creative medium from novels. The basic story has become a timeless classic, often copied but never equaled.  Jane is a poor orphan who becomes a governess for Rochester's ward.  He is a wealthy man with a beautiful estate.  They fall in love but a horrible dilemma from his past comes forth to haunt them both.

2 ||| This is probably my least favorite adaptation.  It includes dialogue and scenes that weren't even in the book. Where do people get off re-writing one of the greatest books in history?  Still, though, I must say that at  least they got the characters right. Mr. Rochester was an absolute bear at  first, which is what he should be.  Jane Eyre actually looked the right  age, although I thought she was more aggressive than in the book. The book  really has too much to be done within a 90 minute format. I wish people  would stop trying to squeeze months or years into hours. It just doesn't  work!  It does capture some of the spirit of the story, but not enough to  make it interesting. Skip it.
3 ||| I disagree with the viewer from Cambrige Ontario. I found this version lovely! Samantha Morton was excellent (I need to see "Emma" now), reserved, thoughtful, just as Jane was in the book. Jane had high emotions  but did not strike out often...the childhood was a small part of the book,  and though important, it is not the major part of the story. The  relationship with Bessie and Helen and Mrs Reed are important as well. I  found this version to be just fine, and I am going to buy it!
3 ||| rather disappointing after Mr S acting and characters great sets and clothing pathetic
3 ||| A bit of a slow starter.  The characters were great.  I enjoyed the story line.
1 ||| Didn't know sever series are in black & white. I  felt it was to drab, and very boring. just not my cup of tea!
0 ||| I can't even get past the first volume, it's pathetic, I wouldn't recommend to anyone who didn't want to fall asleep from pure boredom.  Some were black and  white due to a strike when it was made and it's just a chopped up mess.  Wasted my money on this one.
2 ||| I remember looking forward to watching this miniseries just as I do Downton Abbey. But I was disappointed because the quality of production and filming is not up to today's standard.
1 ||| I was expecting this to be wonderful from the reviews, but due to the wretched moral values of many of the Upstairs people I had a hard time enjoying the story.  A few of the Downstairs people had difficulties, too, but they in general set better standards of conduct.  Wish I could sell my copy.
1 ||| I watched the sequel first, which was so good it prompted me to watch the original series. I'm 3 episodes into season 1, and don't think I can slog my way through any more of it. The acting is horrendously hammy, and the story lines are foolish and juvenile. Unlike the recent Upstairs Downstairs, it's unrealistic (in one scene, one of the actresses was changing out of her clothes and you could see she was wearing bikini underwear under her white bloomers), and showed little of what the world was actually like in that era. The house it's set in is dull, and alll of the characters are over exaggerated, annoying, and unlikeable. Basically, it's just a bad 1970's Soap Opera.
0 ||| Sold it on eBay for half the price after only watching 15. Minutes. Would recommend you only purchase one DVD before you buy the whole set. I had thought it would be like Downton  Abbey unfortunately it was not even close.
3 ||| Loved this one and the original as well. So different - yet the same in many ways. The characters are quite interesting. It is also fun to see the characters in other parts - other movies -
2 ||| I expected more or maybe I was expecting something like Downton Abbey.  Was enjoyable, but was somewhat disappointed.  I'll watch it...only once.
2 ||| Video is fine, but understanding British speech, although it is lovely, is nearly impossible with this series.  Understanding a percentage of the dialogue isn't good enough.
0 ||| too stagy.  maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  did not even finish the first episode.  too boring to whatch this
1 ||| VERY FIRST DISC WOULDN'T PLAY.TRIED FOR 2 MONTS FOR SATISFACTION FROM VENDOR WAS REALLY CHEATED.I FINALLY HAD TO ORDER ANOTHER SET
3 ||| This series is not a happy one because it documents the unraveling of a family. but at least one character has a happy ending.
3 ||| No so sure this is the WHOLE story.  Some series did not follow so well like there has been some edited??  But on the whole i enjoyed it very much.
3 ||| I'd been hearing about Upstairs Downstairs for years. Somehow I never saw it when it was aired on PBS and the discs were a bit pricy for a 'hope it's good' purchase.  Finally I found this 40th Anniversary set -- produced by Acorn -- at an irresistible price and took the plunge.  My wife and I sat down and watched episodes 1 through 3 and each of us had the same reaction. What was all the fuss about?  Upstairs Downstairs seemed to be a mediocre, low-budget, Brit sitcom and nothing more. We took a few days off and then decided to give it another go. And are we glad we did! For starting in episode 4 the entire feel of the series changed from a cheap sitcom to thoughtful human drama.  Okay, the "cheap" feeling stayed for somewhat longer. Only as the years went by did the production values start to go a bit upscale.  Never near the level of something like Downton Abbey, mind you, but good enough to become invisible.  The production and mastering of the Acorn set is so-so at best, both as to image and sound quality and the interface. (Oh, the junk you have to sit through on each year's disc one before the program starts! Ugh!) And instead of defaulting to having no subtitles 4 out of the 5 sets defaulted to subtitles on. Grrr!  But the drama itself is the thing and all that technical stuff pales into insignificance once we got absorbed into the characters and the stories. This is human drama as real as life -- full of the complexities, ambiguities, triumphs, joys, disappointments and sorrows of real life and told with feeling and an underlying appreciation for what it means to be human.  As such Upstairs Downstairs is highly recommended.
2 ||| How is it the 40th anniversary collection of this Masterpiece classic does not have subtitles for the hearing-impaired? This show deserves a 6 star rating, but the subtitles are MISSING.
2 ||| The picture quality of this version is better than the earlier version, but not anywhere near as good as the original broadcast.  It has been cleaned up with the result that some of it looks too bright, which is almost as annoying as the blurry version released earlier.  Also, the picture on my copy freezes up at least once during most of the episodes I have watched so far, often so badly that I have to restart the episode and skip that part.  I checked it on two other brands of DVD players and it froze in exactly the same place every time.  Watch it soon after purchasing so you can return it if your copy freezes up as mine does.
3 ||| I have debated a while before buying this as I had seen some of the episodes when it first came out. At that time I was a nurse working shifts and we didn't have a recorder in those days. I am so pleased to have this series -- nostalgia and history win with me every time and I have not regretted buying this -- not one bit. I also liked the extras you get with the set, it is nice listening to Jean Davies describe how the idea came about and also listening to writers, producers was, as I found, very interesting. As for the stories themselves -- each episode could stand on its own -- although they do follow. You meet delightful characters and also there is a lot of pathos, I have cried a few times -- and laughed. If you enjoy well written, well acted, stories about Britain's past then buy it.
2 ||| As I have stated in many of my reviews, with technology changing so fast wait. Right now there is Blu-Ray, coming is 3D, so what are we supposed to do with all the expensive sets we have already bought? So far the current 3D Blu Ray players do not say they will play your current standard definition DVDs.
3 ||| Heard about this series all my life...finally bought it..and have problems understanding dialog....cast seems to mumble at times...and at others, talk so fast with the British accent that this Southern gal has problems hearing/unstanding dialog.  love the cast... but am tired of "backing up" trying to get the gyst of the script
1 ||| The first episode was in color.  The next episodes were in black and white.  The sound went up and down throughout each episode.  I think it was episode 21 or 22 which was repeated and the ensuing episode wasn't on the disc.  I wrote the BBC to ask about getting a replacement disc with the missing episode and never got a response.  Whoever did the quality control for this DVD set should be required to give us all refunds or at the very least prevented from ever producing DVDs again.  I bought this series as a gift and it made it look like I bought some slightly irregular box set on clearance, instead of getting a quality set like I assumed I was gifting, which was highly embarassing.  So if you're buying it for someone else, keep it in mind that they're going to be disappointed.  You'll still get to see most of the episodes, but expect that you'll be adjusting the volume throughout your viewing and don't count on watching the episodes in color, as they originally aired.  At least it's a period piece, so you can tell yourself that's why it's in black and white.
3 ||| What a pleasure to be able to watch every episode of "Upstairs Downstairs" at your own pace, with NO commercials or fundraising breaks!  I was surprised watching this megaset how many episodes I don't recall ever seeing.  I'm not sure whether that's because I was out of the house at the time -- in the days before VCRs -- or because some of the episodes have elements reflecting the racism, anti-semitism, or other unfortunate aspects of the Edwardian age which U.S. networks elected not to broadcast.  At any rate, one need look no further than the brilliant first episode to see why this series is one of the best -- if not the single best -- historical drama ever, and every bit as captivating today as when it was originally broadcast.  With clockwork precision, the first episode introduces us to the aristocratic Bellamy family who live upstairs at 165 Eaton Place, and their staff of devoted servants working downstairs.  We see how the house functions, in particular the duties of the servants through the course of the day -- and we are introduced to one of the richest casts of characters this side of Dickens.  The steadfast and resourceful Hudson the butler, played by the late, great Gordon Jackson... the fastidious Mrs. Bridges the cook, played by Angela Baddeley... Rose the parlor maid, played by series co-creator Jean Marsh... Mr. and Lady Bellamy, played by David Langton and Rachel Gurney... their children James and Elizabeth, played by Simon Callow and Nicola Paget... all are indelible creations magnificently realized.  In the course of the series, the years from the first quarter of the twentieth century come to life with an unerring eye for detail, from the advent of electricity in the home to the adoption of the automobile to the crackle of the first crystal radios and early victrolas to the sinking of the Titanic to the horrors of World War I and the crash of the stock market in 1929.  Watching the series again, I was moved to tears on a number of occasions.  I felt as if I was spending time with a dear family I hadn't seen in many years.  This megaset also includes a twenty-fifth anniversary special that reunited many of the cast members to reminisce about the production.  One of the most amusing anecdotes comes from series co-creator Marsh, who recalls that there were "upstairs" dressing rooms for the cast and "downstairs".  The former had windows and boxes of tissue; the latter did not.  The Bellamy family cast were automatically assigned the "upstairs" dressing rooms -- until Marsh finally spoke up and noted that as series co-creator, she deserved a box of tissues as much as Rachel Gurney!  Then there is the spinoff series, "Thomas and Sarah", featuring the ever-scheming, never-succeeding former chauffeur and maid of the Bellamy household, which I consider more of a curiosity than a drama as compelling as "Up Down" itself.  Still it is a welcome inclusion for dedicated fans.  I have deducted one star for the technical problems of this DVD set, which have been cited by other reviewers as well.  A&E obviously didn't lavish the same attention to detail on the mastering of these discs as the writers, directors, and actors who created the show, and it's a shame.  Especially annoying are the little boxes of "digital dither" that appear in the upper right corners of many episodes, plus the nonexistent color correction in others.  Still, these technical issues detract only slightly from the breathtaking panoply of the drama unfolding here, and at a price around half that of the box set when it was first introduced, this megaset still merits inclusion in a British television enthusiast's collection.  One hopes, as others have noted, that A&E will eventually release an improved megaset that clears up these technical issues and perhaps includes another set of reminiscences from the series creators and television commentators.  Until then -- "look sharp," as Hudson would say, and order this spectacular set to enjoy with your family!
3 ||| I just have received this set.  I have viewed the first 2 episodes and it is as well produced and written as I had anticipated.  I saw none of the productions during their initial showing.  I am truly looking forward to viewing this whole series this winter.
0 ||| It goes without saying that "Upstairs/Downstairs" is a brilliant, entertaining series well worth the owning.  When Amazon offered the Collector's Edition Megaset on a great sale, I couldn't pass it up.  I didn't really remember the series well, but I knew I very much wanted to see it.  Like others, I read the discouraging reviews about the A&E Home Video transfer, but I thought, I'm not really that picky and it's probably not all that bad.  Well, I am not that picky; I don't care about things being in HD or looking like a "Harry Potter" movie.  That said, I want readers to know, I was very, very disappointed in the visual and sound quality of A&Es Megaset.  So much so, I had given thought to sending this set back and exchanging it for another in hopes that it might be better.  But first I did some research.  I googled "Why are the DVDs of A&E's Upstairs/Downstairs so bad?" and found an informative website which had a page on the US A&E version.  It made it clear that A&E Home Video had used old copies of the episodes for their remastering instead of getting new ones from the UK, undoubted a cost saving measure on their part.  As someone who has purchased many of these wonderful, older British series, I can tell you that the A&E version of the Joan Hickson "Miss Marple"s are not terribly good either, although they are certainly better than these sorry things. I have only taken a quick look at the two Thomas & Sarah DVDs and they do appear to be somewhat better than Upstairs/Downstairs.  Hopefully, someday another company will release a quality set of the original series.
0 ||| One of the very best TV dramas ever made, enjoyment of it is almost totally ruined by appalling picture and sound quality. I have no idea what "digitally remastered" means, if this is the result. It's a disgrace to charge almost $250 for a product this inferior. I actually thought my copy was a bootleg, made by some bloke pointing a digital camera at a TV screen -- it's that awful. There is also a constant "shadow" track on the audio, which sounds as if someone has a radio on in the background. Just disgraceful. Avoid.
3 ||| I can't help myself, I just love this series.  I missed it the first go round in the 70's on PBS due to "life events" that were going on for me, but it is such a stellar series -- and it is so affordable in the "Complete Series" package by A&E that I have to tell you that despite the poor poor quality of the DVD, the stories are too fantastic to not view and own if you are on a budget.  I do notice the DVD "panning" or "slowing down" or even the fuzzy notation for the next reel in the upper right corner, but I just acknak it and let it go, and let the story and character draw me in and in and in and on and on and....
0 ||| I purchased the first issuance of USDS when it first came out.  I returned it five times only to find out that the glitches were in ALL production issuance.  When I heard that USDS was to be reissued "digitally remastered" I was over joyed.  I have made it through about one half of the series.  It has been repackaged, but don't expect an improved picture quality. SHAME< SHAME A & E for a rotten reproduction of one of the best mini series of all time.
2 ||| OK so the BBC in the 1970 decided to produce a long runnig series of the lives and loves of the decadent Edwardian rich, only problem, most of the unions in the production studios were on strike. So, do they wait to start work on the series when all the techs are back OR do they just go ahead and film the thing in B&W with poor sound etc etc ....  Yup you guessed it .. they started the series in B&W cause the execs at BBC never really expected this series to take off.  This may have been very good and well back in the 1970's but they should have explained it to the buyers of the DVD set that the first few DVD's of this box set are in B&W and really really bad production... It took  me a while checking my equipment and the disks to realize what they did .. menu in colour and movie in B&W ... thanks!  I sort of expected the DVD set to improve after disk three when it switched to colour but, trust me you could clearly see a substandard production of the 1970's .... I guess for the purists they did nothing to fix the production with today's modern sound, video enhancement programs/computers  ... What you saw is what you got ....  OK so I am really bugged out because I bought the box sets of 'The Forsythe Saga' and of 'Horatio Hornblower' series that were produced and published by the same BBC and A&E people, so you can probably understand why I was so so disappointed with this 'megaset' .....  The three star rating on this set is certainly deserved by the writing, scriting, casting and most certainly the acting ... the directors and the producers though should be punished....
1 ||| For the price of these documentaries,,,the color footage is definitely worth 5 stars.(if you pay under 7 dollars).The quality of the color footage is very very good..and not seen in other documentaries I have seen (I have seen most of the ones on Amazon).  HOWEVER....  the History Channel takes the footage and mixes it with its USUAL propaganda and more propaganda stories than talking obectively about WW2. and what happened in the war. so much of the time you will be watching a propaganda story and footage associated with it..and not hearing about the stages of the war.  nice if turn the sound down and just watch what there is interesting only.
3 ||| Based on reviews I'd read beforehand, I expected something big with this 2-disc set.  To its credit, it runs 2 hours and 51 minutes.  But it's on the pricey side and a lot of what's shown here has been on other more recent (and less expensive) DVD's, like "Hitler, in Color," which is really outstanding.  I also expected this DVD set to be better than "World War II in Color, the British Story."  On the contrary, the latter costs less than half of this one, ran over an hour longer and had more unique footage and commentary.  The "British Story" is all on a single, collector's edition, digital disc.  For those building a DVD library on World War II, especially color features, this 2-volume set belongs in your collection.  For those operating on a budget, choose the two DVD's noted above, first.  Then, consider "Visions of War, Vol. 2--Hitler, in His Own Words," and various pieces on Winston Churchill, for greater value.
3 ||| I loved the true story of courage.  I objected to the cursing, because the reading I have done about Washington describes him as an introvert, and a God fearing man who constantly encouraged his men to pray, repent, fast and seek divine guidance for the cause of the revolution.  I think the frequent cursing was added to the story by script writers who thought the language would add drama to the situation, which it did not!
3 ||| With his Continental Army shrinking around him George Washington has someone 'requisition' some ships to get his men across the river so they will not be as easily accessible to being demolished. He gathers with advisors and is ridiculed for his lack of leadership and the fact that he ahs not won a battle.  For his last act he decides to attack Trenton, New Jersey where Soldiers of Fortune are stationed, to accomplish that they will have to get a thousand men across the river, at night in the cold for Christmas! They arrive at dawn and attack. Interesting and insightful. War violence, swearing.  In Extras is a making of feature in which Jeff Daniels talks.
3 ||| good
3 ||| good
3 ||| My husband really likes special movies to fit the holiday. He really enjoyed the further truths and knowledge he gained from this movie.
0 ||| Bad
0 ||| NOT CLOSED CAPTIONED.  Not subtitled.  It is a great story if you have normal hearing but if you need closed captioning or subtitles you are out of luck.
2 ||| ok
3 ||| ok
3 ||| Adequate, only because this is the only film I've seen about an important piece of American history.
3 ||| interesting take on the crossing all thought conversation obviously imagined
3 ||| I liked it primarily because it's a historical war movie. Not the greatest production, but when you consider how many movies we have from this period in our history, you won't get much better.  I think Jeff Daniels did a fine job as Washington, though I DID like him better as Joshua Chamberlain.
3 ||| well done!
3 ||| Good.
3 ||| Not a bad movie at all, but lacks a bit of historical accuracy.
3 ||| Well directed movie
1 ||| The acting was really great.  It was quite enjoyable but seemed to differ on the character of George Washington.  He was known for not allowing cursing, for reading his Bible several times a day and praying.  I did not see any of these qualities displayed.
0 ||| Just what we need: a screenplay by Marxist author Howard Fast on Washington's attack on Trenton.  A waste of the considerable talent of Jeff Daniels. Washington simply did not reason the way he is portrayed by Fast. This is what might have happened had Howard Fast been leading the Revolution.
1 ||| I wish I could give this movie a better review. Amazon did NOT warn customers that this movie was not subtitled or closed-captioned for the hearing-impaired/Deaf. In my family, we need all our DVDs to have subtitles or close-captioning capabilities. Don't get this movie if you rely on subtitles.  I cannot judge this movie on its historical content since I was unable to understand what was being said. But having read other people's reviews, it sounds like a movie worth watching. I only wish that A&E had released it with subtitles so everyone would have the opportunity to enjoy Jeff Daniels as George Washington.
3 ||| The only thing keeping me from giving this movie a 5 star rating is that the production was obviously on a limited budget. But true stories are the best stories, and the story of how dangerously close this nation came to losing the War for Independence is one that bears repeating. Our victory against the British was surely the result of Divine Intervention. There is a lot of great acting in this movie.
0 ||| The first ten to fifteen minutes of this movie had so much cursing in it our Family could not finish it. This movie IS A VERY POOR PORTRAYAL of George Washington's character!  It makes him out to be a fool instead of the person he himself was.  We shredded it so no one else would be subject to its filth and lies.
3 ||| Very well acted and the action was above average.  Was better than the regular TV fair.  Not sure of all the historical accuracy but movie flowed well and seemed well acted.  Always been a fan of Jeff Daniels so maybe a little biased.
3 ||| A story that every American needs to here. The supporting characters personalities are portrayed very well and accurate for the time period. Jeff Daniels does a solid job as Washington, but I was surprised at the crassness of language the screen writers added. I am not saying that Washington never spoke in such a manner, but in all the books that I have read, I have never come across a time that Washington spoke in such a manner. Still, the story is incredible... and true.
2 ||| Overall, I was very impressed with this production focusing on a single and important event in a long, hard war.  In this movie, none of Washington's men were lost. In "Washington the Warrior", 6 of his men were lost. Which is correct? I think the latter. Despite the creative licence taken by the producers and writers, there is still much about this that is factual and the performances were impressive. I bought this as part of the History Channel Founding of America box set and I'm still working my way through the DVDs.  This and Washington the Warrior were very well done,  but  do  not  waste  your  time  on the "founding fathers" and "founding brothers" History Channel DVDs. I don't think the Karl Marx fan club could have made a worse presentation of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. It was a ridiculous assault disguised in the form of a historical production. Seriously biased against small government Jefferson and Madison and drooooling over big government, American Monarchy advocating Hamilton. Garbage.
0 ||| I agree the the reviewer's comments that Daniels is miscast as Washington. No one would take him for a Virginian; rather like the old Disney production of the Swamp Fox played by a young Lesley Nielson with a New York accent. Also Welsh actor Roger Rees with an English accent plays the Scottish general Hugh Mercer who had to flee Scotland for supporting Prince Charlie.  One of the worst and unexcused errors is when Washington asks after the battle: "how many killed?" "None" (correct). "How many wounded?"  "none". Incorrect. There were four wounded one of whom, the most seriously wounded was a young lieutenant in the 3rd Virginia named James Monroe. Fifth president of the United States. Worth mentioning I would think.
3 ||| Fairly well done, except for the rather rough language that the real Mr. Washington would never have used. For a more realistic look at of our first president ,I recommend the movie John Adams. Mr. Washington was a true gentleman.
2 ||| This movie was well made, but had too much swearing in it. I understand that they were soldiers, but George Washington was a Christian and would not have spoken with so many profane words. We were only interested in the historical content of the film, but would only watch it once.
1 ||| I recently saw the HBO miniseries "John Adams" and was compelled to watch this movie for a different perspective on a portion of the same period.  Like most American schoolchildren, my familiarity with the crossing of the Delaware at Trenton was limited to the famous painting of that event which shows General Washington perched imperiously in the prow of a boat while being rowed through icy waters in the dead of night.  The reality was decidedly less cinematic; unfortunately, so is this made-for-television treatment.  Admittedly, I was spoiled by the superior production values of "John Adams" beside which this production pales.  In its favor, it does present a grittier version of life in the Continental Army than we are accustomed to seeing and does much to humanize the deified personage of its Supreme Commander.  But the production was hobbled by obvious budget constraints and prosaic camera work that make it look very like the TV project it was.  This decisive battle that turned the Revolution in the colonialists' favor is portrayed as little more than a skirmish between Washington's ragtag band of volunteers and a bunch of unsuspecting drunks.  Maybe in truth that's all it was, but the amateur look of this production does nothing to elevate the action into something a little more noble.  It appears that the fate of the Revolution hinged on little more than a brawl.  But it was a brawl the fledging nation desperately needed to win, and Washington is revealed as a crafty stratetician who was willing to risk all on a breathtaking gamble all others dimissed as insane.  The isolation of Washington's command is portrayed with numerous references to the utter lack of support for Washington from the very body that had authorized him to carry out this war.  Citizens of the Republic in the present day may take comfort (or not) in the knowledge that from its very earliest incarnation, the Congress honed its reputation as a bunch of blow-hard self-promoters who existed to endlessly debate but not to act.  Also shown is the in-fighting among Washington's generals, some of whom resented his authority and in some cases, plotted actively to undermine it.  As Washington, Jeff Daniels successfully gives the 'statue' flesh and bone.  He has a wonderful physicality for the role and looks every part the vigorous and devotion-inspiring leader in his prime.  More problematic is his delivery, which sounds too much of the contemporary Midwest (Daniels is a Michigan native) and not much at all like the 'gentleman from Virginia.'  In general, I am not in favor of American actors larding up their dialogue with distracting accents, but though Daniels looks great, he does not sound convincing as a Tidewater aristocrat.  In contrast to the mostly British supporting cast with their more elegant diction, Daniels is rough-hewn and out of his element.  He also delivers his lines very s-l-o-w-ly; one hardly thinks Washington, in the heat of battle for his life and the Republic would have been so laconic. The teleplay by Howard Fast (based on his novel of the same name) displays a tin ear for authentically colonial-sounding dialogue, with many 20th century anarchronisms creeping in, and it presents the greatest obstacle for the actors.  Some worthwhile moments of content, but stylistically this could have done better by its subject.
3 ||| In all honesty, I expected this to be a so-so movie, however it turned out to be well done and very enjoyable. Jeff Daniels gives a wonderful performance as Washington and lifts the movie above the usual mediocrity of most made-for-TV-movies. All too often, actors are cast to play historic characters they just do not fit. In this case, not only does Daniels bear a passable resemblance to Washington, but he conveys the concern, insecurity, impatience, and determination the general admitted to feeling in his letters and correspondence.  I enjoy reading about history, particularly the colonial/Revolutionary War period, and am generally wary of historical movies due to their tendency to fudge on facts. While I do not claim to be a historian, I found The Crossing to be pretty accurate. I do wish they had brought in more soldiers since the battle scene appeared somewhat skimpy in that regard.  The sets and costumes fit comfortably with the time setting, as does the language and mannerisms. The picture is clear and clean, not distorted by fading colors or other problems. While it was made for TV, I did not find the breaks to be annoyingly obvious as with some. The DVD includes extras, including an interesting account of the movie being made, as well as interviews. One part shows how stunt men made the battle scenes appear real- something younger viewers might enjoy.  There is neither objectionable language in the movie, nor any sexual themes. The battle is not particularly bloody or violent, but would probably be PG if rated. It would make a nice addition to a homeschool history curriculum as well as the family video library. I will certainly be watching this movie again.
3 ||| Good films on the Revolution are hard to find.  This one was packed with action and the drama of Washington's last roll of the dice when the odds were so severly stacked against him.  The film is truly worthwhile, if only to further instill some patriotism in your kids and remind yourself what our ancestors went through to gain our independence.  And Washington would be a hard character to play:  unless your Jeff Daniels.  He nails it and truly captured the heroic aspects of that great man.
3 ||| There are some historical inaccurracies in this film, to be sure. The Wikipedia entry for the movie has most of them. And like most movies dealing with any war, there are not enough men on the screen to portray the actual number of soldiers involved. Washington had more than 2000 troops when he went into Trenton, up against about the same number of Hessians. Of course, without computer-generated graphics, there's no way a made-for-television movie can portray that.  I have to question the casting of Jeff Daniels as Washington. I know Washington was a flesh and blood person, but somehow Daniels (or perhaps the script he had to work with) does not communicate the gravitas that must have personified Washington. This was a man chosen practically unanimously by the Continental Congress to lead the army. Daniels does not come across as that sort of person.  Although it is known that Washington had a temper, especially in extremis, most of the time Daniels' Washington comes across as merely petulant or even bitchy.  The dialogue between most of the characters seemed at times to be pretty anachronistic. American screenwriters should take a lesson from their British counterparts (Andrew Davies, for example) on how to write 18th Century dialogue that sounds authentic but not stilted or phoney.  Finally, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. We watched it with our 7 and 9 year olds because they're studying the Revolution in school. We were dismayed by the bad language, sexual references and the over-the-top bloodletting. Why did the director think it a good idea to show closeups of bayoneting and swords going all the way through people? Showing it is one thing -- but closeups? C'mon! At least the DVD should have indicated what's in store so parents could be informed.
3 ||| GW is a very hard man for Americans to warm up to the. The Man is like another Virginian that comes to mind, Robert E. Lee. Both seem to be Marble Men (Not of real flesh & blood). All I can say is Thank God we have men like them when we needed them. Mr Daniels does his best to create the persona of out Founding Father and I feel that he comes pretty close to the mark.  This films captures what I feel is the key moment of Washington's life as a General. In a bold and courageous move he won a good solid victory that helped keep the cause alive. No one else could of done it. I also feel that it showed accurately for a movie at least what ot must of been like to have been there. The uniforms seemed correct as was the weopons and tactics.    All around a good addition to ones collection.
1 ||| The Crossing is really just not a good movie, but I still find it interesting because some of the movie was filmed quite close to where I live; the opening scene when Washington's bedraggled army is marching through a wooded area, and the camp scenes near the beginning of the movie. To say that the acting in this movie was good would be a slight over-statement, and the dialogue is not what one would call stellar.  I would not be so certain about the accuracy of the movie either--few movies are.  The general course of events may be faithfully adhered to, but no movie based on a historical event that I can think of has not taken liberty with the truth for one reason or another.
3 ||| This is a made-for-TV movie produced by the A&E television network in 2001.  It was adapted from a novel by Howard Fast and I assume it is historically accurate.  It's about a defining moment in American history - that of George Washington crossing the Delaware River and attacking the well-trained German soldiers hired by the British, at Trenton, New Jersey. I recently visited a friend who lives in that area and walked across the bridge where George Washington made this historic crossing.  Of course there was no bridge back in 1776 on that cold December day -- just the dark and the cold and an ice-filled river.  The Continentals, which was what the Americans were called then, were losing the war. They had not won a battle since they declared independence six months before on July 4.  The troops were weary and starving.  It looked like the American Revolution was lost. But Washington took a huge risk, and in his own quiet and determined way, made a decision that changed the course of history.  The scenes of the actual crossing were done in fog and shadow, as the boats moved towards the opposite shore.  But there were no scenes that looked like the famous painting with Washington standing in the front of the boat.  In this film, Washington was sitting throughout. Naturally, this made me re-think my own historical perceptions. Jeff Daniels is cast as Washington, and I found myself very critical of his performance.  He seemed aloof and wooden and, even though there was constant danger, he never lost his cool, calm leadership abilities.  I understand, though, that this is exactly the kind of person that George Washington was. If this is true, then he did portray him well. Basically, though, even though there was some conflict between the various generals as well as a bit of bawdy language and some violent scenes of swordplay, the film never rose above that of a history lesson, one shown in classrooms or while visiting museums. I tend to like my drama more complex though, and for that reason this film, while well done, has to be viewed for what it is.  I therefore give it a modest recommendation.  It's certainly worthwhile seeing.
3 ||| My girlfriend and I enjoyed this film and felt as though we'd really seen George Washington.  The film begins in 1776 and ends with the conclusion of the surprise attack on Trenton.  This is one chapter of history we feel intimately acquainted with now.  Although it doesn't seem to have enjoyed a great budget and although it has just a hint of an educational taste to it, the Crossing seems far more historically relevant than films like Patriot or Pacino's Revolution.  Daniels displays incredible posture especially while riding a horse and as a passenger in a boat through all hours of the night and thus quietly impresses upon us the dignity of America's first and fearless leader.
3 ||| I often show "The Crossing" to my political science classes and invariably they are enthralled.  It is an intriguing, almost shocking film.  The most striking surprise is that Jeff Daniels pulls off a portrayal of the great Washington with humanism, determinism, unparalleled leadership, mixed with a little testiness and bawdiness - in sum, a man with flaws who took his life and his mission seriously, while winning the loyalty of his rag tag troops. Washington was somewhat wooden, which Daniels again plays well, because he took every aspect of his life with dead seriousness and a clear vision of the nation he almost single-handedly created.  Present at the creation of the new nation, commander in chief, he rallied his men at the battle of Trenton in December 1776, the subject of this film, avenging his early loss of New York City. The inaccuracies in the film are of little consequence since its essence is Washington.  His audacious crossing of the treacherous Delaware on Christmas eve in the depth of night, completely surprising battle-hardened, but hung-over Hessians, helped turned the tide of the war at a time when America's victory teetered on disaster.  Daniels creates a man, not a myth, giving him just the right amount of stiffness and caring for his men, and a determination that would win the very long war. James Kidnie as the Hessian Colonel Rall is the perfect foil to Washington.  As the attack rages, he meticulously dresses himself and then panics at the American onslaught, hardly believing his eyes.  Director Harmon's pacing is plodding at times, but the crossing itself is full of suspense, the battle scenes more than passably exciting.  The cinematography and supporting cast are adequate. But the star of this film is Daniels. In sum, a fine A&E production well worth seeing.
3 ||| Federico Luppi, the fine actor from Argentina, takes the lead role as Dr. Fuentes.  He sets out to find his former students on the road to places he's never been. The shift in his life is caused by the death of his wife. He sets out in spite of his family not wanting him to leave. The aging doctor first encounters one his former students, now a drug dealer, using the same drugs he taught him to cure others, he is now using them for ill purposes. His journey has only begun and he finds many more dissapointments along the way. This is a beautiful film that is allegorical, historical, contemporary  and packed with messages for the viewer to interpret. In his quest to find his students he finds his country to be quite different from the view he had of it prior to his leaving the city. He encounters missing people  and tales of abductions from men with guns. The villagers call them white men with guns but are quick to say that the Indios are also now white men. Although the story takes place in an unnamed country, the parallels to Guatemala are clear. Having witnessed a corpse on the roadside while travelling in a bus (everyone gawked with little concern, as though it were a common sight) in Guatemala and seeing the treatment first hand of the military I am pretty sure this is where it is. However, this is unimportant as these occurences of hit squads and paramilitary goons, in cahoots with the military, are a frequent sight in many Latin American countries. Anyway, Dr. Fuentes picks up several people along the way to expand the tale. He picks up a "liberation priest" who abandons his collar and those who believed in him, a former military thug turned thief, an indigenous young woman who doesn't speak since she was raped by soldiers and a street-savy kid who is an orphan and Dr. Fuentes's guide. All represent the society Dr. Fuentes is unaware of and  as they tell their sordid stories, amidst flashbacks  and surreal dreams, a country whose people live in brutal chaos is revealed . This is a powerful movie, one to be seen more than once in order to fully enjoy. Although the story evolves around Dr. Fuentes and his crew,  there are several encounters with a funny couple who are "informed" tourists with bad Spanish accents  and worse pronunciation. A completly enthralling film, in spite of its length, that hits close to the harsh reality of life in Latin America. A beautiful film  that is set to the backdrops of the jungle and it's  relics from the past, as well as present day village life , it is a movie that is visually breathtaking and mentally stimulating. Recommended for those that like movies that carry a political and social commentary. Great stuff, see it before your next vacation to the tropics, so that as the guy from the radio says"and now you know the rest of the story" before you get there.
0 ||| Disappointing, to say the least.  Unfortunately the filmmakers have chosen to turn President Ford into some sort of cinematic action hero when the opportunity was there to do a thorough examination of his mishandling of Watergate.  Shame, shame...
3 ||| Loke
2 ||| This is a good action movie.  Terrorists highjack the Presidents plane with the President still on it.  He is a former marine and fights back.  HarrisonFord iis excellent as always.  Gary Oldman as the head villain is as well.  If you like action movies you will like this.
3 ||| Old but a classic worth watching.  This movie was made in the days when the plot was thinner and the violence was less gruesome (there's still plenty of killing).  I thought the acting was above average all around and Harrison Ford's was his usual excellent.  A good movie when you want some action with a little plot, but aren't in the mood to see heads getting chopped off and blood  spurting everywhere.
3 ||| Harrison Ford as President? You can't beat it.....Great movie
2 ||| Very good action, but stretches the willing suspension of disbelief to the breaking point in my opinion. The idea that all those trained secret service agents could fire so many bullets in such close quarters and not even stop one hijacker is pretty unlikely. The agents were not very good at taking cover either.  Plus, even though it is just a movie, seeing all those guys get shot in the takeover scene is hard to watch.
3 ||| Fun action movie with Ford as a believable President with a couple of slightly unbelievable scenes.  Great adventure and suspense.
3 ||| Some unnecessary bad language. Great plot and ending.
3 ||| good action and suspense
3 ||| love it.
3 ||| Good. Movie
3 ||| Its a good time at the house with some popcorn.
3 ||| Classic Harrison Ford. I Think he though he was in a Star Wars Movie.
3 ||| Good movie
2 ||| is a good movie and plenty of action.  I always enjoy Harrison Ford movies.
2 ||| Olde but goodie
3 ||| still relevant with intense shoot-out after all these years!  Good Friday night fun!
3 ||| Great acting by main characters and supporting actors
3 ||| My second time watching this one. Just as good as the first time.
3 ||| This one is a popcorn-chewer of the first order!  Terrific performances by Harrison Ford and the always astounding Gary Oldman head an excellent cast in this wonderful nail-biting trip on the President's plane!  The blu-ray is a fine program release.
3 ||| High intensity, action packed and of course, the good guys always win.  The only thing I had an issue with was the talking was quite but the action was very loud...as if I was in a surround sound theater.  I turned on the caption and it was just fine.
2 ||| Die Hard on Air Force One with the President of the United States as John McClane?  This one has easily one of the most ludicrous high concepts of any high concept action movie from the past 30 years.  When it played in theaters I hated it--and I'm a huge fan of action pictures, although not of star Harrison Ford.  At that time I would have given Air Force One a one star review.  In light of the fact that the screenplay was by Andrew W Marlowe, the creator of Castle I decided to give the movie another shot and I have a slightly different take on it now.  Given the cheeky tone of his television show, which takes nothing, least of all murder seriously, I'm inclined to think that the script for Air Force One was written as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on dumb Hollywood action pictures rather than an actual dumb Hollywood action picture.  The problem is that native German director Wolfgang Peterson (Das Boot, The Perfect Storm) while tremendously talented is not known for his sense of humor or light touch.  He has an uncommonly good eye for widescreen visuals and old-style you-can-clearly-see-everything-that's-happening approach to his action scenes but he directs Air Force One with way too much gravity, making whatever humor that manages to survive seem campy and unintentional.  It's hard to ultimately made the action set-pieces in Air Force One exciting given Wolfgang Peterson's approach since it's simply not possible to take any of them as seriously as he apparently does.  I'm not suggesting that Air Force One should have been directed as a comedy but there's a lighter approach in the films of fellow countryman Roland Emmerich (Independence Day; 2012; White House Down) that would have been perfect here.  Emmerich knows how to direct ridiculous material in a way that allows it to be silly and fun but still exciting--he knows he's making silly pulp films and embraces the humor of the ridiculous cliffhangers while allowing the audience to laugh without guilt and still enjoy the action and suspense.  For a practical example of what I'm talking about assume you are in the mood for a disaster movie--would you rather watch Wolfgang Peterson's technically well-made and lavish but dull Poseidon or Roland Emmerick's deliriously ludicrous but exciting and funny 2012?  The choice is obvious for me--but I was also a big fan of Emmerich's White House Down which I couldn't even get any of my friends to even watch, so what do I know?
3 ||| Great Movie!
3 ||| Good movie.
3 ||| Classic Harrison Ford
3 ||| add on to my library :)
2 ||| This could have been a 4 star movie but there are parts that are just pathetic and they are relatively frequent.
2 ||| Wasn't the terrorist a famous actor too? Worth watching !
0 ||| I never enjoyed this movie.
3 ||| Nail biting suspense
3 ||| Good action movie, I think a older Harrison Ford could have pulled this one off a little better, Gary Oldman was a very good choice as the bad guy!
3 ||| This is a typical Harrison Ford completely over the top action flick. If you like this type of move you will enjoy this one as I did. If you prefer movies with some semblance of reality then this may not be for you
2 ||| Pretty sure my husband liked this more than I did and would give it 4 stars.  It is a good movie with an exciting finish but has a pretty high body count.  Terrorist are not my idea of entertainment.
1 ||| Again- There were so many times during this movie that my jaw just dropped at the stupidity. The typical argument in defense of a film like this is, "Of course it's stupid. It's an action movie." Yes: even the good action movies tend to be stupid. This one, though, is stupid but has nothing to recommend it. The patriotism is simplistic, insipid, and insulting. The plot is trash, the characters trash, the action trash. The movie doesn't even make sense within its own reality - suspension of disbelief fails you. What an awful, awful film. This is the kind of movie that makes me look suspiciously at anyone who thought it was good. I wish there were a no-star option.
3 ||| I've watched this movie several times over the years. I enjoy it every time.
3 ||| Pretty much a nail baited.
3 ||| I really like this movie. A movie with Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman. What a combination!!! It is unusual because so much of it takes place on the plane but it works.
3 ||| good old movie
2 ||| This movie is of the kind that used to be known as a "star vehicle" back in Hollywood's Golden Age. Harrison Ford is such a likable movie star, and one that audiences can always put their faith in. It's as if his sole reason for getting up in the morning is to entertain, and this he has been doing like no one else for 40 years.  "Air Force One" (1997) is just a classic action adventure movie. Ford is the President, flying from Moscow aboard the presidential airplane back to Washington, along with his family and many staffers. The plane has not been in the air long when Gary Oldman, (excellent as always), pops up as the leader of a gang of Russian terrorists who hijack the plane, hellbent on having the President release a hostage who is a general and folk hero. Of course, the US does not negotiate with terrorists -- or does it?  The Oldman-led terrorists are vicious, but not brilliant. They completely lose track of the president, and he manages to escape into the belly of the plane. His family and staff don't know where he is, either. He manages to use his cell phone to call the White House -- whether that would work or not, I don't know. In any case, he and everyone in the Situation Room devise a plan to neutralize the bad guys and rescue the good guys. It may be far-fetched, yet clichd, predictable stuff, but a good cast, entertaining story and pretty good dialogue make it seem less so.  Ford mutters to himself better than any actor, and he gets to do a good bit of that while he's below decks. He is always a step ahead of the terrorists, and he and Oldman face off well. There are some nice little twists and turns.  Don't expect a tremendous amount from "Air Force One." and it won't disappoint. The most startling difference in movies like this made in the late 1990s and those made in the mid-2010s is in the special effects. CGI has completely changed the look of movies, and allows for much greater suspension of disbelief. The action sequences in "Air Force One" would have benefited from the now-ubiquitous process, but you can't work with what you don't have.
3 ||| Good movie.
1 ||| Short on plot; long on violence for its own sake. I was disappointed in the way it ended; never getting Harrison Ford on Terra Firma. The only memorable line, "Get off my plane" didn't warrant a rating higher than two stars, and wasn't enough to make it worth watching a third time (I watched it twice to see if I might have missed further enjoyment, but I didn't). They cast Wendy Crewson; one of Canada's greatest actresses as First Lady, and gave her nothing to do but cower in the corner acting timid. And Glenn Close as Vice President was a commendable choice; if only she hadn't bowed to all the men, even the discussion over the 25th Amendment lacked the anticipation one might expect in the given situation. This film was cast w/ some of the greatest talents; its just too bad they were let down by what I feel was so weak a script.
3 ||| Harrison Ford knows how to protect an airplane, but I wish he would not fly his personal planes over homes. Although I'm impressed with how well he recovered from a mechanical failure of his plane on a golf course and wish him good health in the future.
3 ||| Very exciting but too much at the end of the movie.
2 ||| Good Movie but rather dated.  The acting was very good and it is a great lesson in how our world has changed in the years since this movie was made.  I wonder how much more tech. the new Air Force One is compared to the one in this movie.
3 ||| Love Harrison Ford.  Action packed and the good guys win.
3 ||| Great movie, I had already seen it several times, it just remains awesome.
2 ||| The movie was action packed but predictable. This was a cookie cutter plot of many other similar films.
3 ||| Great, action family (14+) movie. Violence (killing)
3 ||| I ordered this for my husband because he had watched it previously and enjoyed it.  I asked him how it would rate it and what I indicated is what he decided.
3 ||| Love it!
3 ||| I have seen it before so I did not see the whole thing but it is worth seeing. If you like unreal stuff it is good fantasy
2 ||| Just like most Harrison Ford flix.... very well done.
3 ||| It was taut and exciting as most of Ford's movies are.  I think he is an awesome actor...and Gary Oldman was fantastic as the enemy.  If you like action and minimal bad language, sex, etc...but lots of action, this is a good movie for a cold night at home.  ;-)
3 ||| Classic collector for those who love HF.
3 ||| Good movie, Good action
3 ||| old movie
3 ||| Seen it a number of times, always enjoy watching it again and again but with a few years in between.
3 ||| Non-stop action, fine, if not subtle Harrison Ford.  Pleasantly unlikely plot, with an odd undercurrent of executive and cabinet irresponsibility. Oldman stronger, and more restrained, than he sometimes is--and with an accent to boot.  Shocking number of dead bodies, however, too much carnage to give the deaths any dramatic (or human) sting.
3 ||| Just a wonderful story....great action
3 ||| This has been a favorite movie of mine since its release. It is non-stop action from beginning to end. Harrison Ford is excellent in his role as the President. Gary Oldman is one of the scariest bad guys you'll see in a movie. I enjoy this film every time I watch it. It is well worth the time to watch it.
3 ||| good action flick, seen it before and watched it again without any boredom. sneaking around, shooting, planes falling apart........what more could a person want.
1 ||| Same old script with the President who takes the terrorists on his own. Entertaining if you want complete fantasy and the Amercan hero who can do no wrong.
2 ||| BOUGHT AS A GIFT.
2 ||| It was just ok, some scenes was just so unbelievable!  For example, guns firing off in an airplane....really!? and there is no aftermath regarding the plane!? Hmmm, not believeable.
3 ||| It's a good movie.  I have seen it several times.
3 ||| A little hard to believe,but Ford makes it great.
3 ||| Pretty good movie, thought I had seen all of his movies.  Like it very much
2 ||| A fun old-style action movie --with cookie-cutter characters including a noble, politically progressive, independently minded, humanistic, and macho president, with enough of a big heart to interrupt a world-saving negotiation to tie his daughter's shoe and hug her, as well as a sloppy but pragmatic Russian president (you know, these brute bears but with a noble core) and a superb oh so mean and cruel Uzbec assaliant, upset because we, the good guys, at the beginning of the movie killed a bunch of Uzbec presidential guards and kidnapped and jailed their tyrannical leader. Oh well, just enjoy it and don't analyze it too much.
2 ||| Exactly what you should expect from a summer blockbuster. Exactly.
3 ||| Good movie, if you don't put much attention to the improbabilities, you'll enjoy this movie.
3 ||| A little far-fetched, but a good movie for those days you  just want to be entertained.
3 ||| suspensefull
2 ||| sorry ,my internet speed isn't that good, couldn't watch the but 10 minutes of the movie.
0 ||| What a heap of steaming DUNG......
2 ||| Impossible venues, can fire a gun in a plane with major damage.  When a black box is chopped up with an axe, a second one does not come available.  If a man is suck out of an opening, how can other men pull in a second man with only one hand?  Impossible events.
3 ||| exciting and well performed. cinematography amazing. but predictable.
3 ||| Missed it at the movies.  Now with PRIME how easy.  Good action flick, a little predictable but enough to make you guess a little.  Great action sequences.  RECOMMENDED for the action flick people.
3 ||| I had not seen this movie in quite some time.  A great performance by Harrison Ford and the villain is one that is hard to forget.  I enjoyed watching this movie again.
3 ||| As always,Harrison Ford is a fine actor in most of his productions. Widescreen No rating
3 ||| Great!
2 ||| Ok
3 ||| Every minute is suspenseful and action packed.
1 ||| Who does not worship at the altar of the evil incarnate Gary Oldman? OK given his "Immortal Beloved" venture, went against type but he represents the zenith of scare tactics even with the most insipid of actors, Harrison Ford. You can tell he did not know what hit him when his eyes realllly bugged out in all of the strangleholds by Oldman. Ford was in real pain and fear and I was cheering, FINALLY a real emotion from this one noter.  The only dialogue worth mentioning was the reference to killing 100K Iraqis to affect pump price reductions. This sentimental "USA All the Way" notion would fall on deaf ears today given the lowest ratings for leadership. I am confident we would be overjoyed with a huge military base from China near Los Angeles. There are approximately 800 'known' bases around the world, that is some kinda democracy imho.  Where did they discover the FAX Lady? She was awarded PostMaster General for sending a 3line FAX, and she LOVES Skydiving! I believe that honor would be best bestowed to the President's daughter, she had it all under control. Another astute observation is the Russian actors sure were good looking and hard to view as enemies, they even work out! However, not enough for that savage cunning 53YO President who kicked a$$ in 'Nam 30+ years prior.  I respect the director for his other projects, i.e. Das Boot, unclear how he would accept this dirge of gratuitous.... you name it, they had it. Consequently, hilarity ensues with this many hits and more misses than is conceivable. Congrats Hollywood!  PS - Could not believe how President's wife looked and sounded like Sharon Stone.
3 ||| My husband likes this movie very much.  It is one of his favorites.  We pretty much like anything Harrison Ford.  In our opinion, he is a great talent.  Air Force One has a very creative story line with a lot of action that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  We are replacing an old VHS tape with this DVD.  This is a very good movie.
0 ||| scam
3 ||| While the basic story line is not that believable, the cast pulls it together and somehow makes it entertaining. Lots of action and Gary Oldman is such a nasty character to Harrison Ford's good guy role. I enjoy the movie since part of it was filmed in Columbus, Ohio and a former co-worker's relative did the lighting for the night scene with the 747 in an airport. A good action vehicle for Ford.
3 ||| One of Harrison Fords last great action movies.  If you are a Harrison Ford fan, this one will not disappoint.
3 ||| It you enjoyed the Spice Girls you'll like Spice World. Just a long music video with them on a big bus. A few stars pop in and out to spice it up - wink wink. You can see Alan Cumming before he was on The Good Wife. If you've got a free afternoon and like the spice girls pop this in and sit back for the right. Get up and dance if you like.
0 ||| My wife really really wanted to see this. I guess she just had a sudden and overwhelming urge to revisit her childhood. Anyway, as a grown man who was never into this type of music, I couldn't even make it past the first 15 minutes... and it felt like an epic struggle to last that long.
2 ||| I forgot how terrible this movie was.
3 ||| The best part is playing "spot the cameo" with a generous double handful of guest actors. Not a fan and I still enjoyed it for the campiness.
3 ||| I saw this film for the first time in theaters with my aunt and a friend, at the time, bad move!(long story) I'm much more analytical now with movies, most of the time. Harrison Ford does a very good president who has a no-nonsense approach to terrorism, led by a cold and merciless terrorist Gary Oldman. The plot is fairly easy to follow, and composer Jerry Goldsmith, who I'd swear Saw composer Charlie Clouser took some tips from) once again has an excellent musical score. Even though I do enjoy this film, I do have a couple issues with it: first, I know Gary Oldman is the primary villian in this film, and the script makes him very easy to hate, more with actions and facial expressions. However, he isn't the only character I couldn't stand, Dean Stockwell as the Defense Secretary, how pathetic, in this case. Aside from Harrison Ford, Glenn Close, the wife played by Wendy Crewson from Good Son and daughter, some characters don't last long enough to even care about. And in movies like this, you have to know the villian has back-up, unfortunately, that cliche has gotten very old for me, along with the "kill the witness formula". All that aside, this also set the stage for two other similiar movies recently released in theaters, both that I watched and overall liked-Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down) This film however, seemed like a blueprint for those films, even though, obviously, the new ones, seemed a lot more intense. In those films, however, at least with White House Down, the media was as bad as the terrorists! When it comes to news reporters and tabloid reporters, whatever celebrities want to dish out at them, including violence, dare I say it? Bravo! Esp. when they are so relentless and don't care who they hurt to get their story, remember Princess Dianna? Don't even get me started!
2 ||| Not what I remember but as a kid loved this movie. Maybe you need to be a kid to enjoy?
3 ||| Loved the movie in the theater and love watching it again. Who doesn't want to see their president fighting back against the bad guys!? Just wish there was less profanity.
0 ||| It may have seemed pretty good when it came out but in retrospect this is one lousy movie. Clearly high raters are rah rah Americans. Much overacting on almost everyone's part. Harrison is just horrible. Actually he's never been very good has he?
0 ||| Impeccable production of a wildly absurd story. . .  The US president single-handedly (or nearly so) takes on a half-dozen extremely well-armed terrorists, carrying out feats worthy Bond, James Bond. But everytime he gives in when the leading terrorist threatens the president's wife or daughter. In addition to the absurdities, i also find it unpleasant to see the US president being tortured and degraded by the terrorists. Also, the director seems to use the movie to promote his personal politics.
3 ||| Any resemblance between President Bill Clinton and the Harrison Ford Chief Executive in Wolfgang Petersen's far-fetched, entertaining, but woefully predictable skyjacking saga "Air Force One" ends when Ford's fantastic First Guy starts knocking off the villains. Nevertheless, the parallels between Clinton and Marshall appear clearly obvious. Harrison Ford's President James Marshall is married to a tenacious, headstrong wife in the Hilary mode, and they have a 12-year old daughter. (So was Bill Pullman's president in "Independence Day.") Unlike Clinton, President Marshall flew helicopter rescue missions in Vietnam and received a Medal of Honor. No, the filmmakers refuse to identify President James Marshall's party affiliation, which make "Air Force One" impartially political, while it trumpets America's anti-terrorist stance.  Andrew W. Marlowe's melodramatic screenplay shows more agility than innovation. While his characters emerge as largely one-dimensional stick figures, the dimensions of their predicaments assume nothing less than cataclysmic proportions. Marlowe's script keeps Harrison Ford leaping through enough flaming hoops to fill three movies. Like several other summer blockbusters, Marlowe's script does not know when to throw in the towel. Just about everything that can happen aboard "Air Force One" occurs. Presumably, with the recent spate of skyjacking movies, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood appropriated both Air Force One and the President as the pulp of their fictional escapade.  The movie opens in slam-bang style with an elite American commando team parachuting into Kazakhstan at night. Using the latest hi-tech gear, they kill the palace guards and abduct an adversarial Russian leader, General Radek (Jurgen Prochnow of "Das Boot"), who is promptly incarcerated in a Soviet hoosegow. Three weeks later in Moscow, President Marshall stipulates that the U.S. refuses to negotiate with terrorists. Meanwhile, a ruthless ultra-nationalist Radek zealot, Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman of "True Romance"), succeeds in smuggling his bogus TV news crew aboard the most secure plane in the world. A disgruntled Secret Service agent, Gibbs (Xander Berkeley of "L.A. Takedown"), as we later learn, helped these guys obtain their security clearance. Once the plane is airborne, Korshunov and his men commandeer it, kill the pilots, and watch helplessly s the president ejects in his escape pod. (Does anybody remember "Escape from New York?") Ivan contacts the Vice President (Glenn Close) and vows to kill a hostage every half-hour until Radek walks away from prison. According to Defense Secretary Walter Dean (Dean Stockwell), Radek's release would bring down the pro-American regime in the Kremlin and bring back the Cold War, so the Russians are reluctant to set him free unless President Marshall makes the request personally for Radek's release.  The filmmakers cannibalize in typical Hollywood fashion every neat idea from all the other skyjacking thrillers. Generally, "Air Force One" follows the formula of the Kurt Russell hit "Executive Decision." Both movies start with a commando raid and then shift to terrorists hijacking a jetliner before an unconventional hero makes his entry. You can tell that Marlow evidently watch the Wesley Snipes thriller "Passenger 57" for one scene. Another scene features a stunt that appeared in both "Airport 75" and "Cliffhanger." The president here imitates the action heroes from the Bruce Willis "Die Hard" franchise and the Steven Seagal "Under Siege" movies. Finally, the "Air Force One" ending should come as no surprise to any "Star Trek" movie veterans. Anybody who thrives on movies like an insomniac will spot these plot elements. Although "Air Force One" borrows heavily from other epics, the staging of the action and some new scenes in the skyjacking formula boost this opus over the rough spots.  Anybody familiar with German director Wolfgang Petersen will recognize the affinity between "Air Force One" and his earlier classic U-boat thriller "Das Boot"/"The Boat" (1981). The casting of "Das Boot" star Jurgen Prochnow as the heinous General Radek aids in this comparison. Moreover, Petersen sends his highly mobile and energetic cameras plunging about the corridors of "Air Force One" with the same dexterity that they swept through the hull of the sub in "Das Boot." Despite a connect-the-dots plot, Petersen makes every dot a fire storm of intensity. The scene where the President's jet careens wildly across the airfield in Germany and nearly crashes is pretty harrowing.  Ford's presidential protagonist is basically Indiana Jones in a suit and tie. The filmmakers rely on Ford's action hero charisma to compensate for the lack of depth in his inadequately sketched head of state. Shrewdly, they shift gears to the parental side of the chief executive. Ford's best scenes occur before take-off when he asks about his favorite football game. Although Marshall emerges as a cardboard politician, it's his "Die Hard" courage that wreathes him with laurels. Unlike those wimpy Jack Ryan movies "Patriot Games" and "A Clear and Present Danger," Harrison Ford's hero here kills the villains. The bad guys don't slip out of Marshall's clutches and conveniently impale themselves on sharp objects. (Remember the way the "Patriot Games" villain died?) Marshall runs up a body count, kills with a machine gun, snaps necks, and slugs it out with rough and tumble adversaries. Ford is one of the few male box office stars who can shed tears (when Ivan threatens to pull the trigger on his daughter) and not make it look schmaltzy. Ford manages to maintain a stiff upper lip throughout "Air Force One" and his scenes with bad guy Gary Oldman crackle with electricity. Ultimately, however, Ford's performance qualifies as serviceable, nothing truly special like the cop the played in "The Devil's Own" (1997).  The real casting coup in "Air Force One" is Glenn Close as Vice President Kathryn Bennett. Close manages to hold her own in a room packed with veteran male character actors like "Quantum Leap's" Dean Stockwell who constantly bullies Close to usurp presidential authority. Although certainly not the most original skyjacking melodrama, "Air Force One" manages to add elements to the formula and boasts enough visceral R-rated violence to keep you distracted throughout its 124-minute running time.
1 ||| I'm just tired of movies that have no individuality.  They don't even try to attempt something remotely original, and that seems down into their casting decisions.  How many times do we need to see Gary Oldman play a creepy villain?  Honestly, how many times do we need to see Harrison Ford play a Presidential figure of some sort?  Even Glenn Close gets type casted in those `women who wish they were as powerful as men' roles.  That is the big issue with `Air Force One', there is nothing original here.  The story is preposterous and pretty straightforward with no real stimulation.  It doesn't make a lot of sense and yet it is forgivable action fluff for the most part really.  The action scenes are effective and some of the visuals are nicely constructed, but the tension just doesn't live up upon multiple viewings, and really with a film this redundant in basically everything it isn't worth watching more than once.
3 ||| Yeah, I'd vote for Harrison Ford for president. President James Marshall, to be exact. He's not only the president, he's a first class hero, as this story makes clear. Brief sketch, so as not to ruin all the surprises: there are dozens.  Air Force One, with the First Lady and First Daughter (age 12) aboard, is highjacked by a group of fanatical communists who want to restore the Soviet Union. Key to their plans is the release of their favorite general from Russian prison. One clue -- just one -- to the whole thing is pretty clear early on in the highjacking: one of the Secret Service agents guarding the president is helping the terrorists.  The leader of the terrorist highjackers is Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) who is clearly insane, and has no qualms about killing in cold blood. Back in the White House Situation Room sits Vice-President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) trying to cope with it all. Her advisers can't agree, the military folks present various pretty drastic alternatives, and the highjackers have said they will execute one hostage every half hour until their General is released from prison and they have confirmation of the fact.  OK, there's your tip of the iceberg. The rest is simply too unpredictable for me to want to spoil anything for you. See this film!
3 ||| One of the most memorable scenes for me was when Harrison Ford hid behind one seat but turned the neighboring seat to make it look like he was crouched there instead. So when he jumped out and attacked the hijacker I got a nice jolt. This masculine thriller has good pacing and acting but there were a few amateurish special effects that detracted from its realism.
2 ||| AIR FORCE ONE is a fun movie. It's the kind of action movie where you can suspend your disbelief and just sit back and enjoy. And at the same time this film depicts a President that many of us really wish we actually had in the Oval Office: a politician who can literally kick some ass. Harrison Ford demonstrates that he is still a really good action hero, and is also a great actor. That acting talent goes for the opposite side of the coin in Gary Oldman. Both actors make their performances believable in this movie. Good action movies have to have a great villain. And Oldman definitely provides that in his role.  After the successful capture of Radek: a rogue Russian General who has committed genocide on his country's people, U.S. President James Marshall announces to the world in Moscow that America will not tolerate any terrorist organizations. "It's your turn to live in fear," he says to the world. His National Security Advisor (Tom Everett), and Chief of Staff (Paul Guilfoyle) are not happy with this change of policy, but the president doesn't back down. Fortunately, his wife (Wendy Crewson), and his daughter (Liesel Matthews) stand by him on this belief.  Air Force One takes off from Moscow, heading back to Washington. On board is a Russian news crew who were invited on the trip. But then, everything turns to hell when one of the Secret Service agents (Xander Berkeley) kills his fellow men and unlocks a weapons cache. The news crew reveal themselves to be terrorists and quickly hijack the plane. The Secret Service manage to get the President down to an escape pod, which is jettisoned from the plane before they are killed. The terrorists believe that Marshall had escaped in the pod, and then reveal what they want. They tell the Vice President (Glenn Close) to release Radek, or the hostages will be slaughtered one by one.  It turns out that President Marshall released the pod himself and hid himself away. He understands that it is up to him to save the day. And he fights back against the terrorists one by one. Yes, at this point, AIR FORCE ONE has recycled the same plot as CON AIR, DIE HARD, and UNDER SEIGE: terrorists overpower everyone in a specific place, except for one man, who has to save the day. On top of that, it also borrows from the old AIRPORT disaster films of the 70's: something goes wrong, and now we have to get the plane back on the ground.  These kind of plots are certainly a cliche. That is true. Done wrong, they can be so incredibly ridiculous as to invite the MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 style wise-cracks. But it's not what kind of plot you use for a movie, it's what you do with it. With AIR FORCE ONE, director Wolfgang Peterson brings in a cast of very gifted actors. Harrison Ford is a great choice as the president. Gary Oldman is not only believable as a villain, he is even given some dialogue that expands on this character. After he shoots a hostage and is called a cold-blooded murderer, he retorts back with this quote: "You murdered 100,000 Iraqis just so that you could save on a gallon of gas, and you call me a murderer?" It's also a delight to watch Glenn Close as Vice President Bennett in the Situation Room, along with the great character-actors Dean Stockwell as the Secretary of Defense, and Philip Baker Hall as an Attorney General who advices them on what the Constitution says on the issue.  Wolfgang Peterson was determined to make the film as realistic as possible. The other terrorists are played by real Russian actors. I recognized one of them: Elya Baskin, from MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON. In that film he was the fellow circus performer and best friend to Robin Williams. (You may also remember him in the SPIDER MAN movies as Peter Parker's landlord.) In the production notes of AIR FORCE ONE the director, production designer, and Harrison Ford all went on a tour of the real plane. This film depicts the jet in almost complete accuracy. Some creative liberties were taken, of course. But for the most part, we can believe that this is what Air Force One looks like. And on top of this, Harrison Ford does all of his own stunts. He was in his mid-fifties when this film came out in 1997, but he was still in great shape. The United States Air Force actually gave full co-operation in making this film, since it's a very positive kind of movie for this military branch.  As I said before in the beginning of my review, AIR FORCE ONE is a fun movie. Then-president Bill Clinton loved it. He actually encouraged Glenn Close to play the Vice President before she was cast. I like her, and the other performances. Could such a scenario actually occur on Air Force One? I seriously doubt it. The plane does not have an emergency pod or parachutes in the back. These parts of the film are almost laughable, but it still makes for good entertainment. After seeing this movie, I began to wonder, what if we elected a war hero and Medal Of Honor winner as the President, and ended up with a beautiful woman as The Vice President?
2 ||| ... whether you view it as a serious film or a comedy. As a serious film, one star. As a comedy, 5. For me, it's definitely a comedy.  See the President of the United States engaging in mortal, hand-to-hand combat with armed terrorists! Sure, he's clearly in his fifties, and going up against young, strong, trained combatants; but he's a Fighting President! And nobody, but nobody, is going to take over his plane! (He makes it clear at one point that it's "my plane!". Funny, I thought the plane, and the White House, etc., belonged to the people. Guess that's an outdated concept).  Meanwhile, watch the determined Vice President get off the helicopter (not sure why she was flying around in it in the first place) and whirl into action, issuing orders and taking command of the situation. Because she's a Fighting Vice President! Oh, we have a minute or two of the obligatory scene where she and the Secretary of Defense argue about who is in charge, but that's just for show. In the next scene, the Fighting Vice President is still running the show. And doing so brilliantly! Because she's not a figurehead VP, as most are; no, it's made clear that she and the president are good friends and close partners (yep -- that's realistic). Also, she looks exactly like George Washington, so she has that added gravitas. (Don't know what I'm talking about? Go to google images and enter "glenn close air force one". Find the picture where she's standing in front of the "White House" logo in the press room. Put it next to the image of Washington from a dollar bill. Compare the hair, the eyes, the nose, the lips. They could be twins).  To fully appreciate the absurdity of this movie, imagine it with our real president and veep. Look, I'll be non-partisan about it -- imagine either Obama or Bush in hand-to-hand combat with armed terrorists and killing them. My own choice would be Clinton and Gore, who were in office when the movie was made. I think "Air Force One" is a great comedy; but if someone would use CGI to replace Harrison Ford and Glenn Close with computer-generated Bill Clinton and Al Gore, and dub their voices in -- well, that would be, by far, the greatest comedy film of all time.
3 ||| I am not a big fan of Harrison Ford's work but there have been a few films that I have enjoyed with him in it.  Air Force One is very entertaining with a lot of action and suspense.  The special effects are quite good as well with a lot of different and neat tricks to them.  Overall, if you enjoy action/suspense type movies be sure to give it a view.  Peter J. Miller
3 ||| The film is reminiscent of many an airplane, ship, railroad and, probably, even ferry boat, terror-hostage-'noted individual at risk' film; however, making it the President, gives it an extra bit of  pizzazz. Of course, Harrison Ford does his usual professional job, the nasty guys are suitably nasty, the good ones are suitably heroic, and one forgives them their excesses in the name of thriller necessity. Thriller it is, and, a good one. Lovers of the genre, accustomed to forsaking reality for the sake of enjoying a film, will like this one. I liked it. The only thing which marred it for me, occasionally was the lurking thought which would rise to the  surface before I firmly repressed it; what if we really had a President in a crisis who also ignored his oath of office so readily, had no sense of his duty to the country, what if we really had a Vice-President so unwilling to do the hard but necessary things. Never fear, President Harrison Ford will triumph as will V.P. Close. Never fear, the United States does not collapse into anarchy.
0 ||| The one star is for the blu-ray edition of this movie, not for the movie itself (which otherwise I consider to be one of the best action movies I have ever seen).  The blu-ray edition is too grainy and has very bad color saturation and low contrast. Worst of all, the digital scenes of air combat with Soviet (Ukrainian) jet fighters are just horrible: blurred sores on screen.  It is a shame that an otherwise fine film like this was released in Blu-ray without making the necessary upgrades to ensure that some scenes would not look like crap when viewed in high definition.  Save your money and wait for a future version of this movie that is properly transferred to a high definition format.
3 ||| Excellent. Fast delivery and just as described
3 ||| Director Wolfgang Petersen had previously focused on the life of the President in his film, In the Line of Fire (1993), and he returns to that subject in Air Force One (1997), a big budget, over the edge thriller, that had the cooperation of the US Government, and the personal support of President Bill Clinton.  Although Kevin Costner was originally in mind to play the President, it would be hard to imagine anyone better suited to this role at the time, than Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones).  President James Marshall (Ford) is returning from the Soviet Union, travelling with his staff and family on Air Force One, the President's custom modified 747.  While in flight, terrorists disguised as journalists, take over the plane, led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldham).  Secret service agents rush the President to the escape pod in the lower section of the plane.  The pod is launched, so the terrorists believe that the President has escaped, but he remains hidden aboard.  Back in Washington, Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close), is in charge of the negotiations with Korshunov, who is demanding the release of General Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), a criminal being held in a Soviet prison.  US fighters arrive to escort AF1.  As the Government works to recover the pod, Korshunov begins to execute hostages.  The President communicates with Washington via satellite phone, restating his policy of non-negotiation with terrorists.  This signals Marshall's transition from Commander In Chief, to chief buttkicker.  Finishing as one of the top five grossing films of 1997, AF1 is a classic late 90's mainstream Hollywood blockbuster.  With a huge budget, big stars, special effects, and tons of studio backing, it is Grade A entertainment for the masses, where lovable action hero type, Harrison Ford, dons a superhero cape, and against impossible odds, Marshall saves the day.  For the film's key element, the producers researched the real AF1, as much as they could, but much about the craft remained classified.  Within that pseudo-realistic framework however, reality is seriously mangled, as Marshall travels with relative ease, and the hull is never breached by a bullet.  The terrorists are terribly inefficient, failing to take immediate control of the cockpit, and letting the President escape.  Oldman's Korshunov, is quite the patriot, when threatening women and a child, but isn't much as commander of men.  The cast also includes William H. Macy (Sahara), Wendy Crewson, Xander Berkley, Paul Guilfoyle (CSI) Dean Stockwell (Quantum Leap), Liesel Mathews (A Little Princess), and Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot).  Wolfgang Petersen is a storyteller, that understands the effective use of action, and he provides an enthusiastic, and informative commentary.  He marvels at the amazing things that were done in the special effects department, which by today's standards, appear quite dated.  Air Force One is an overdramatic, pretentious, but fun fantasy, with a patriotic streak.  It is too bad that today's real problems can't be dealt with so simply.
3 ||| This is a movie that's nothing more than good, silly fun.  Like any "Die Hardish" movie, you just need to relax, enjoy the ride and not think about logic. This is certainly Harrison Ford's last, really watchable movie (don't get me started on "Crystal Skull"!) and there should've been more scenes with Harrison and the always excellent Gary Oldman.  It's fast paced and never dull. If you enjoy over the top action movies where it seems like no matter how bad the situation is, it gets worse, this is one for your collection.  The good: The picture and sound are clean and spectacular, although the special effects show some rough edges.  The sound of the F-16s (?) flying in circles is a great way to show off your surround sound.  Now the bad: The Blu-Ray version doesn't have any extras except for Director's Commentary (which was on the DVD) and "Blu-Ray Live."  A serious disappointment for me! I subtracted a star for this. Otherwise it'd be a 5-star.  Also, the Blu-Ray came with a Wal-Mart price sticker on it.  Whaaaat?
2 ||| Pssst.  Quiet.  The whispering President (Harrison Ford) has spoken.  Upon boarding Air Force One, with the hope of catching a few precious hours to himself and his T.V., the whispering President comes under attack in an attempted hijacking by Russian strong men (led by superb actor Gary Oldman).  The plot thickens as Air Force One is taken by force and makes a remarkable series of 20 wheel drifts through Rammstein Air Base Slalom Course in West Germany.  Shortly thereafter, the George Washington hair-doed Vice President (Glenn Close- I always get her mixed up with Merryl Streep!) tries to negotiate with the hijackers, but to no avail.  Since no other man will step up to the job (bloody wimps), the rubbery-faced President has to defeat the hijackers on his own.  Despite constantly looking dazed and confused, especially after kissing his robust secretary in exchange for sending a FAX, the whispering President manages to usurp the hijackers and kill their esteemed leader.  I was saddened to see the former German U-boat commander, now a General by the name of Radek, die only footsteps from freedom from a Russian prison.  William H. Macy offers to upgrade the exterior of Air Force One with a nice Tru-Coat, but Wade doesn't think it's a good deal.  But hey, it's a good action flick and is worth a watch.  Over and out.
2 ||| *** SPOILER in the 2nd paragraph ***  I'll be honest: I didn't expect a whole lot out of this save-the-president film; though I like Harrison Ford well enough, I won't say I'm exactly a fan, and the plot seemed really hackneyed.  Why'd I watch it, then?  I guess I was in the mood for this kind of techno-thriller, in which the President's plane is hijacked by terrorists, and our middle-aged President (Ford) who was formerly a Vietnam combat pilot gets to play hero and almost single-handedly take out the Russian bad guys headed up by nasty psycho Gary Oldman and prevent them from returning evil commie Jurgen Prochnow back to power in Kazakhstan.  Complications include the President's wife and daughter being on board, and disagreements between principal cabinet members (chiefly Glenn Close as the VP and Dean Stockwell as the Secretary of Defense) on how best to handle the situation on the ground; the latter element never builds up to anything convincingly suspenseful.  Like a great many of these kinds of films, AIR FORCE ONE started out pretty well and went downhill both in believability and interest in the second half, but it never fell apart completely despite one really annoying plot hole that apparently the producers, screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe and/or director Wolfgang Petersen thought we'd be too stupid to think about:  namely that there's a spy on board in the form of a Secret Service agent, we know about him and the people on the ground know about him, but very little if any effort is made to clue the President in about him - and he basically gets ignored by both the terrorists and everyone else until the very end.  And his motives are never mentioned at all - he just turns rogue because, uh, he thought it would be fun, perhaps?  Not good enough, sorry.  Still, this was more lively and intelligent than it could have been; Ford is OK and the rest of the cast is game enough, if not quite enthusiastic except for the always manic Oldman - who is playing basically the same role he's played a dozen times now.  Worth a watch if you like these sorts of things; better than DIE HARD 2 or 4, EXECUTIVE DECISION, or the UNDER SIEGE films, I'd say, to name some movies with comparable plots from the era.  Petersen is never IMO less than a competent director, and he keeps things moving along OK.  The ra-ra patriotic Jerry Goldsmith score got old and pretty overbearing after a half hour.  A time waster, then, but a reasonably enjoyable one.  The standard DVD doesn't have too much in the way of extras, nothing really of substance besides the director's commentary, which I haven't listened to.
3 ||| I should start out by confessing how I've always been partial to Posh Spice Victoria Beckham (<nee> Adams back then).  Like others have said, this film takes its basic premise from "A Hard Day's Night", then goes wild. This thing covers a couple of days in the life of the girls and leads up to a monumental concert at the Albert Hall in London. It begins at the end of one concert in one town, at the end of which they board their Union Jack-covered tour bus and move on. Thing is, the bus is more than ten times bigger on the inside than the outside, a tribute to "Doctor Who", I gather. That's when the fun really starts.  If you want a serious documentary like one about the Beatles, or the Rolling Stones or the Who, that tries to discuss the more serious influences the Spice Girls have made on our culture, you can fergitabutet, although one of the film's character's is a documentary-maker trying to do just that. Like the Girls themselves, this film is never meant to be taken seriously.  It pokes fun at everything in true British Spike-Mulligan "Monty Python" style. It kids VIP parties, publicity photo sessions, girls being girls, "Charlie's Angels", haunted house themes, army sergeant-majors, news happenings, and the BBC.  There's a newspaper magnate so tired of the group that he's willing to jump on anything that may cause them to disband. There's George Wendt as a Hollywood producer eager to make some sort of film about the Girls and is full of daffy ideas for it. There's Richard Grant as the Girls' hysterical road manager.  There are cameos by Sir Elton John, Sir Elvis Costello ( interesting the amount of knighthoods handed out to major entertainers during the Tony Blair premiership), Stephan Fry, Hugh Laurie, Bob Hoskins, and Jennifer Saunders ("Absolutely Fabulous"), among others.  And there's Sir Roger Moore as the Girl's All-Highest Manager, kidding his own James Bond image. Though I'd agree with other reviewers that the "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" take-off is perhaps a bit much. Is this to show how the appeal of the Spice Girls is truly "universal"  or something?  The Spice Girls themselves are sporting enough to put themselves through any sort of gag. They always kid themselves and each other and preach "Gil Powah," while Posh herself already shows her interest in clothes. And of course they sing their greatest hits, which aren't too bad, though the lyrics being subtitled means you could risk having those syrupy-sweet songs being stuck in your head for some time.  The Spice Girls' fad seems to be over now, but it looked like they had a great time while they were around. And "Spice World", while certainly not nearly as great a film as "A Hard Day's Night," tells it all.

3 ||| Back in the summer of 1997 there was a hit movie called Air Force One, with Harrison Ford&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Clear-and-Present-Danger-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00008K76V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Clear and Present Danger (Special Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;as the President who formulated a plan to stop a terrorist dictator in Kazakhstan.  Praised by the Russians, the President declares he will not back down or negotiate with terrorists.  Those words would haunt him.  A group of Russian reporters (a.k.a. the terrorists from Kazakhstan) get on board and with the help of a mole get into a gunfight on Air Force One.  Now I don't know how realistic any of this really is:  bullets flying all over the plane and the plane apparently puncture-proof.  Or people jumping from a plane at 15000 feet without too much fear like they grew up jumping out of planes.  Even so, with its faults, it was exciting entertainment.  Ford did get beat up a bit and as the body count rose and the hostages were getting eliminated, you began to wonder if he would ever prevail.  The movie slowed considerably after the last terrorist got strangled by the President.  Yuk.  The whole "plane is falling apart" and "I'll go instead of you" got kinda old fast.

3 ||| Harrison Ford plays a US President that has traveled to Russia to make a deal with the Russians to fight terrorism, and to seal the fate of a rogue ultranationalist, former Soviet general.  When terrorists supporting that general slip aboard and then take over Airforce One, the president and his family are in danger.  The action is good, and the bravado of Ford as the US president is exciting. I have to admit, however, that the believability of the entire story is pretty sketchy.  There are quite a few holes in the plot, the largest being the lack of an explanation about why a top secret service agent, the one over the President's security detail, would ever help terrorists.  Even so, the drama and action are good.  Those things together make for a good, but not completely outstanding show.  4-stars...that's it...and perhaps a rather weak 4 stars at that.
3 ||| This is a great film, and it will be even better on Blu-Ray. I am excited that this is finally being released on Blu-Ray in the US.  Harrison Ford turns in a great role as the President.  The TrueHD Audio should sound awesome - especially the action scenes. I highly recommend.  EDIT: I have now seen this movie and it is AWESOME! The video and audio are superb.
2 ||| Air Force One (1997) Harrison Ford is the President of the United States. Gary Oldman is a hardliner Russian who has just hijacked the title vehicle, and off we go in the new thriller from director Wolfgang Petersen (In the Line of Fire). Although it obviously has echoes of a Die Hard movie, with ex-Special Forces Prez Ford playing cat and mouse throughout the plane with Oldman's minions, this one stays sharp, smart, and entertaining, thanks to a good script and sure footed direction. Also helping is a fantastic cast, including Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, William H. Macy (Fargo), Xander Berkeley (Terminator 2: Judgment Day), Dean Stockwell (Blue Velvet), Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot) and Timothy Carhart (Beverly Hills Cop III). The action and suspense are plentiful, though it possibly goes on slightly too long, maybe sticking in one crisis too many before the end credits. Still in all, that's a minor quibble, and this is still a fine flick to check out!
3 ||| great movie, worth the price.... classic
2 ||| As I said with Xanadu this is a fun movie with a set of adorable girls and its nice to have G movies still around that aren't horrible dumbed down affairs.
3 ||| Of course "AF1" has more plot holes than a Jerry Bruckheimer film, but watching this movie back in 1997 was one of the biggest cinema joys in recent years! "AF1" is a MUST for all Ford fans, as well as fans of action. Wolf Petersen is one of my favorite directors, he makes this movie 'take off' and really 'fly' with excitement. I also should say, Gary Oldman is probably the greatest working film actor today who has never been nominated for an Oscar, (as far as I know). I'm not saying "AF1" is 'Oscar material' but I'd rather watch this than something like "The Last Emperor". "AF1" may go down in my book as Harrison Ford's last great action role, so what if it's unbelievable? Almost a classic. It has it's flaws but is an otherwise very memorable film."
3 ||| As action thrillers, go, AIR FORCE ONE has enough of a plot to keep you watching closely as terrorists take over the presidential plane, a sleek beauty of a craft that makes a gleaming set piece for this kind of adventure in the sky. And who is better qualified to take care of things than HARRISON FORD, somewhat less impressive without that hat and familiar stubble as Indiana Jones. (Well, maybe KEVIN COSTNER who was originally slated for the role).  GLENN CLOSE makes a very commanding presence as the Vice President, seemingly never at a loss in moments of distress, and GARY OLDMAN handles his Russian accent and menacing villainy with his usual aplomb. It's just that if you stop long enough to take a breath while all the action is going on, you might see that underneath all the fancy pinnings this is regulation stuff that's been time countless times before--and sometimes with better results.  The cast is impressive with WILLIAM H. MACY and DEAN STOCKWELL on the prez's team and Jerry Goldsmith providing another one of his dependable, if unmemorable, action scores.  And although Wolfgang Petersen does a nifty job of directing, turning the president of the U.S. into an action hero performing stunts that seasoned stuntmen must have been hired for, does stretch credibility a good deal for the climactic moments when airborne peril is at the max for a cliffhanger ending.  Not bad as an action thriller, but just don't expect it to be any more substantial than a sleek new video game.
3 ||| Just as Dr. Strangelove bordered on the impossible (or did it?), this movie follows an implausible track and makes one feel more unsafe by the day. No Peter Sellers black comedy here. Remember also that this film was issued 4 years prior to 9/11. The true irony is that today in 2007, many people,I suspect, would feel safer with Harrison Ford in the Oval Office and having George Bush and Dick Cheney in a mid-air shootout with subversives over the European plain. In any kind of gunfight, take a Texan and a Wyoming man every time.
3 ||| This is one of my favorite Harrison Ford Movies!! If you like action movies, you'll like this one!! I would rate this movie a 4 of 5 stars!!
0 ||| Not for me..but my daughter was happy
3 ||| Loved this movie as a young gal and wanted it for my kids!
3 ||| Harrison Ford should have been a President... He is great in this movie and could save the world....
3 ||| There are some unrealistic elements to this movie, but only when you stop and think about it.  It's an action movie and there will always be some stretches of reality.  Harrison Ford delivers as does his supporting cast.  It will pull you into the story without any real trouble, you will find yourself routing for the President and telling the evil guys "take that".  In the end, you will feel good about it and you may even be inspired by it.  Enjoy!
3 ||| This is a good movie and will keep you watching all the way through. Harrison Ford is excellent in this and the supporting cast is good as well.  The plot is revelent with all the current world situations. The ending makes you want to cheer!
2 ||| ... USA was the only country in the world where this kind of story (although farfetched) could be happening. Especially when you remember the JFK's fighting history (maybe it's one of the reasons why he was assassinated). But now, when you see the Bush family history, the only war record of the grandfather (at the same time JFK was patrolling in the Pacific) shows his best achievement was building the family's fortune by catering for the Third Reich's financial needs. And I can imagine the present Bush pounding Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on the head with a bible (to show him it's better than the coran), and telling him "Get out of my world". As well, USA lost all credibility when he got RE-elected : One mistake might be understandable, but, as the Romans said "Errare humanum est, sed perseverare diabolicum" (to err is human, but to persist is diabolical).
3 ||| This movie came out a couple years ago, but still today it's a great action movie.  After watching this it makes you feel good about being an american.  Anyways, Harrison Ford said he's ready for another Indiana Jones films.  I'm not sure if or when that will happen.  This is a great movie still.  Its worth buying, no question...
3 ||| This is not great art. It is just a silly, fun, lighthearted movie. If you take it for what it is, it's a pleasant way to pass the time.
2 ||| Marshall is the kind of President alluded to a change in the U.S. foreign policy... He took a great risk when he stated that America will no longer tolerate any terrorist government... His policy is soon put in practice when he boards his plane on his way home...  Once 'Air Force One' is in the sky, it is hijacked and currently controlled by Russian radicals who ask for the release of their leader or they'll execute the hostages on board...  While in Washington the vice president and the president's advisers, deliberate how to answer to the terrorists' demands, the president apparently is deployed in an emergency pod, but, in reality, he's determined to bravely confront the hijackers and retake his plane...  Harrison Ford plays with courage and charisma the commander in chief who has already played his cards, there's no turning back...  Gary Oldman who steals the show as the evil Ivan Korshunov, reminds the President that he is holding 'his wife, his daughter, his chief of staff, his national security adviser, his classified papers and his baseball glove!'  Beautifully shot by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, Petersen builds the challenge with nice sequences from every compartment of 'Air Force One' to the White House contingent in Washington...
2 ||| I really enjoyed this movie when I first saw it, and although I do still like it, my subsequent viewings have found my love of this movie diminishing. Why? It has become too violent for me. I do like action movies like Die Hard, Braveheart, and Under Siege, but for some reason I find some of the violence disturbing and a bit gratuitous and that is not entertaining. Maybe Gary Oldman plays his character too well! There are too many scenes of summary executions and the unfairness of which leave me feeling a bit angry. The best example of that is when the President's Deputy Press Secretary Melanie Mitchel, played by Donna Bullock, is killed in cold blood in front of the Presidents wife and daughter. It is a very disturbing scene and a bit too much.  Despite the violence the movie was a summer popcorn type of film that takes you on an adrenaline filled roller coaster ride of thrills and terror, and in that way it does succeed. Harrison Ford is excellent as the action-hero President. He is a strong yet human character who responds in heroic fashion under extraordinary circumstances. Gary Oldman plays the evil Ivan Korshunov only too well. The one performance that I find annoying is Dean Stockwell's portrayal of Defense Secretary Walter Dean. He doesn't come across as authoritative but rather almost childishly whinny. The movie does also go on a bit too long when the ending rescue is dragged out. Despite its flaws it is still a good action movie made even better by the performance of Harrison Ford.
3 ||| I don't know why I like this movie, but I do. It is mildly amusing and I like to put it on the tv while I am doing housework.
3 ||| When Air Force One, carrying President James Marshall and his family, is taken over by terrorists, the President makes it to the escape pod on the plane, but he refuses to leave while his family is still on board. With all members of the Secret Service dead and the terrorists threatening to kill a hostage every half-hour until a prisoner is released from a Russian jail, it is up to Marshall to stop the terrorists. Will he be able to stop the terrorists and save his family?  Okay, in this type of film viewers know from the beginning that the good guys are going to win and the bad guys are going to lose, badly, but not before lots of people die. But, while somewhat predictable, and highly implausible, this is still a good thriller, with plenty of edge of your seat chills. There's just enough twist on the action adventure formula to keep the viewer from guessing what will happen next.  Director Wolfgang Petersen deserves most of the credit for making this film work as well as it does. There are plenty of thrilling action sequences, especially the one that closes out the movie. Harrison Ford is a bit stiff as the President at the beginning of the film, but loosens up and does fine once he gets into action hero mode. Gary Oldman is wonderfully creepy as the main terrorist. Glenn Close and Dean Stockwell do fine as the Vice President and Defense Secretary. William H. Macy is, as always, perfect in a supporting role. Wendy Crewson is also good as the First Lady.  This is a good action adventure film.
2 ||| But despite that, I have to say I loved this film, and if the ending hadn't kept going on & on, I would have definitely given this movie four stars. It's an amazing film, and I was practically sitting on the edge of my seat, talking (yes, I was) to the TV, saying "don't do that" and other such nonsense.  I've never been a big fan of Harrison Ford, but I'm not sure why. Gary Oldman also gives me the creeps! But I find that films on planes are always filled with suspense, and lots of action. It's probably cos it's all filmed in a confined space. Hey I like these kinda films. And I have to say that Gary Oldman did brilliantly speaking in Russian. He probably wasn't speaking what was coming up on the screen in the subtitles ;) but it didn't come across as forced, or unrealistic, like some actors would do an accent.  My problem with this was the ending. It's one of those films, where just as you think it's about to end, something else happens, and by the very end, it was starting to feel a bit dragged out, and just a bit OTT.  I did find the movie quite realistic in a way, as with Harrison Ford playing the president, and not knowing the number to phone through to the White House (someone else must do all this stuff for the presidents.) And it was good stuff having the vice president as a women. Very un-Hollywood. And they also had Glenn Close not bowing under pressure as her character, when she was being pressured to do other things, give in to the Russians etc.  This soundtrack is really good, and the main theme is a really feel good theme. Although I didn't recognise the theme being played to me straight afterwards - I thought that was just too easy! Randy Newman's score was cut late in post-production by director Wolfgang Petersen for being "too loud and blatty." Jerry Goldsmith was brought in to do the score in TWO weeks. Can you imagine doing a score in two weeks? He was so daunted by the amount of time he had to write the score that he began requesting that his assignments be given to him months in advance of the finishing of a film's final cut.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film, despite the drawn-out ending, and would most likely watch it again. Gary Oldman still scares me however.
1 ||| Who decided to write this plot? Its boring! Although I am not expert, wouldn't the President's plane just have a bit more security? I mean, this is the president where talking about. Everything in this movie just seems so pat and set, there's always going to be an out, and surprise! Guess who's going to do it! Yes! Harrison Ford! Our president is going to kick (...)!  Doesn't that bother anyone? This movie screams Hollywood and follows it so faithfully its scary. In real life, for that is what we are trying to portray, would the president jump out of a falling plane, try to save his rogue commander or any of the other numerous things that never stop happening? Maybe...maybe not. Obviously on Air Force One he's a superman, because he is able to do all these things.  Air Force One needs to come down out of the clouds and have some reality shot into it. Other than that, this movie is a rather decent action thriller. Just for action mind you. That, and fans of Harrison Ford should apreciate his superhuman role.  I didn't, but there's no saying you won't.
0 ||| I got this movie when it came out I have it on vhs the acting is dumb really chressy movie there singing is good but not a good movie there dumb in it I love the spice girl but this movie is not really movie I did not like it
0 ||| This is the kind of movie that should have never gotten to a studio once the script was written. It's so fake and it would never happen.  Harrison Ford is the president and he's kidnapped aboard his plane by a terrorist Gary Oldman. He's negotating for the release of some of his comrades to the vice president played by Glen Close. Ford won't give up without a fight and he's determined to save his family and friends without Oldmans plans being met.  The movie is so fake it's sad. The plane would have been destroyed by pressure. It gets laced with 100's of rounds of ammo. Come on you have to make is somewhat believable. Wolfgang Peterson should be slapped upside the head for putting something like that in a movie.  Glen Close is horrible. Her dramatics are over the top. The fact that her character negotiates for the president is stupid. We don't negotiate with terrorists and the fact that they put that in his dumb. It's so fake.  The refueling plane blowing up is dumb. There are so many saftey devices in place that would never happen like that. You have to mkae a movie at look least real if your trying to make an action drama like this and it's not.  Russia would never give up dangerous men either. They'd tell us they felt bad for the president being in danger and would tell us to shove are demands where the sun don't shine.  This movie is way to fake. I couldn't enjoy it because it would never happen. I enjoy action dramas and this is one of the worst ones I've ever seen. If they had decided to make this more a drama and not so much action I might have been able to go along with it. The cast is awesome for the movie and a drama could have worked. The cast and talents are wasted. Why this made so much money I don't know. I guess people are stupid enough to follow the story. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
2 ||| This film is so over the top it's hilarious, this is POTUS as super hero, you almost wonder why he needs the plane I'm assuming the only reason he didn't reveal his true identity of US PRESIDENT MAN the masked avenger is that he couldn't find a convenient phone booth to change into his star spangled leotard. I enjoyed the film, but I feel a little dash of realism would have made it much better, just a bit believable maybe.
0 ||| On this derivative, by-the-numbers thriller we are forced to believe that an US president (played by Harrison Ford) could actually take down a russian (what else?) group of terrorists, as if he was 007 or McGyver. The beginning of the movie is somewhat credible, but soon presents us with one-dimensional characters and motivations, a lame and predictable plot and wooden, tepid acting. There are some twists, but they are so ridiculous and unbelievable that I stopped caring about it halfway through, given that the resolution has no surprises at all since the "good" guys always win. Despite some competent action sequences, this is brain-dead, mind-numbing material, cartoonish at best and completly disposable. There`s no force to be found here.
0 ||| I rewatched this movie just last night (April 13th, 2003), to see what messages it actually uses to play on people's fears and misconceptions about the world around America. At times embarassing, at times eerily in tune with current events, and at all times constantly questioning one's own common sense. Hollywood is always seeking to entertain and distract its audience, but putting such political issues in focus without any thought or plausibility insults those with any mind to question. Let's just say this is a theatre piece, and dramatic elements have to be employed to add to the plot or sequence of events. That this, and so many movies of its kind employ the use of Russians as the enemy (usually using a British actor to supply the villainy) perpetuates stereotypes and misinformation that has existed since the Cold War's birth. I loved the fact that America was seen as a bastion of technology, with blinking lights and computer screens, and intercoms, technology at the helm, while Russia and its leader had a little red phone and a bear on his table. Fantastic. It automatically sets up a perception that Russia is weaker on all fronts, and the victor will always be America, so the whole premise of the film being America in danger is compromised by its visualisation of its power as compared to Eastern Europe. It throws the whole plot out the window by default. Apart from its Nationalistic stance, the dialogue of the film borders on the ludicrous to outright childlike. The only bite that is heard in this film is from the actual enemy (portrayed by Gary Oldman) when questioning the President's (Harrison Ford) moral constitute when dealing with his Oldman's homeland. The points raised were the only plausible or believeable lines in this movie, but it all too quickly falls into the 'remake Rambo' style of filmmaking too many times. This is just entertainment for the masses, and does not ask any questions of moral fortitude or revenge, or anything actually relevant to anything in any real world situation. Should I take this movie just as it is, entertainment, or for what it represents, 'Horse Blinker' propaganda aimed at the public. I cannot guess why films like this get made???? All that money wasted on a piece of junk. The CGI throughout is quite weak, especially the 'crash' at the end which pays no heed to what a plane would actually do when hitting the water, which WOULD have been far more dramatic a conclusion, if they just paid attention to physics. It was actually hilarious. I think the scariest bit had to be the speech at the beginning of the film by Harrison Ford. I've heard it before somewhere.... Don't waste your time, money, patience, eyesight, hearing or mind on this huge waste of finances. I can't believe some of the actors actually did.
0 ||| I tried to return this item and have to obtain permission from the overseas supplier.  So far it has been over a week and no response.  I thought my daughter would enjoy this movie put she showed no interest and asked me to return it.
2 ||| If you like the Spice Girls, and you don't mind movies with poor story lines, then you'll probably enjoy this.  However, if you try to follow the storyline, which I did, it will give you a headache, like it gave me. There are way too many bad guys in the film, who are plotting various things for the Spice Girls. In the end, we realize they're all good people, and this movie all leads up to a live concert, which is somewhat ironic, because the biggest thing I wondered after watching this film is if the Spice Girls actually recorded any of their own music.  Why do they sound like heavy smokers when they're talking, but that completely goes away when they're singing?  Pros: +Fun, jovial movie +It has the Spice Girls +It has almost all of the Spice Girls' songs +It kind of indirectly hints at the origins of the Spice Girls' nicknames  Cons: -They lip sync all of their songs, and it really shows -Bad sound editing -The tour bus is about three times wider on the inside than on the outside, and since they spend so much time in here, it's really distracting -Way too many extra bad guy story lines going on in the background
1 ||| Just because The Beatles&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/have-done-it/dp/B0000542D2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">have done it</a>, that doesn't mean the Spice Girls should do the same.  It's a heavy risk for music artists to sell their name on to the big screen, and believe me,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/this-could-go-very-wrong/dp/6302261589/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">this could go very wrong</a>.  Some make it out okay with just the bio-pics, other played it safe and just make theirs a concert movie, but "Spice World" took a completely alternate step.  It's a Spice Girls power hour where a lot of zany antics occur, and nothing makes sense.  I might be completely biased with this movie, because much like my unholy memories with Tom Green, the Spice Girls were also a devistating memory of youth; the thing is I used to like Tom Green while I was strongly indifferent with the girl band.  But for most of my middle school years, I'm surround by many fangirls in support of this group who play their music loudly and constantly, and I had to be the butt of a ongoing ridicule just because I made a simple comment that Ginger Spice was cute (and Geri Haliwell still looks pretty good).  My adolescent years was damaged because of the band, so reopening this mental wound does lead to personal spite.  But there are objective things to legitimately castrate this movie.  The biggest problem with the movie is that it's aimless.  The Spice Girls were setting up for a concert, they had a convenient pregnant best friend to chat with, their agent was pushing them to work hard and not have fun, and a tabloit journalist hired a sleazy paparazzo to tarnish the band because he's bored.  Everything else is practically plotless, just random scenarios that segue into other random scenarios.  They sing in different places, they meet celebrity cameos, they go on a photo shoot, two American studio execs are pitching a Spice Girls movie out of the blue, they ride on sport boats with their contest-winning fangirls, they were in a military dance camp with a stern gestappo instructor, and they were discovered by an alien race who loved their music.  There's no connection with each of these scenarios, the randomness of the goofball situations is akin to "Family Guy".  It also means these situations are practically idiotic in direction, if not just wordy whenever the girls just run their months about stuff only pre-teens would get into.  Just to hide the fact that the Spice Girls have no acting talent, the rest of the actors have to be completely bonkers. Their agent acts like if Ari Gold popped some speed and drank a pack of red bull, the tabloit guy is pontifically British, and the studio execs are so desperately perverse when they pitch the worst ideas ever in a film, almost like a parallel to this film; the execs even ripped-off an idea from a show pilot in "Pulp Fiction" (Spice Force Five, get it?). Neither of them are funny, they're just pretentious, much like the movie's gags.  Again, I'm being biased.  I am not the film's audience, the audience are young impressionable girls who loved the band's songs.  This movie understood its intended audience, that's why the Spice Girls went on an S&M club, they let their pregnant friend drink alcohol, they wear revealing outfits, an alien nearly copped a feel on Scary Spice, and their agent threatened to hang himself live in concert if the band didn't show up.  But seriously, the audience for this movie is limited at this point.  It wasn't long after the movie's release that Ginger Spice followed her own independent example and left the band, which cause the foundation to crumble and the fans had to move on.  I could say the Spice Girls are gone for good (and no, I'm not counting their world tour stunt a few years back that lasted only a week), but something life has a funny way of turning things around.  If New Kids on the Block manage to get together&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/and-release-an-album-not-too-long-ago/dp/B001LN2W38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">and release an album not too long ago</a>, it's possible that this girl group would rekindle their friendship.  Regardless, this movie is a nonsensical publicity stunt.
2 ||| Well, I remember this being my favorite show when I was 11 or 12. Couldn't believe they have this movie on DVD so I had to buy it.  It's pretty much a joke of a movie but because I still have some love for the Spice Girls I was glad I'm able to have this for my collection.  It's one of those movies that you get a bunch of your girlfriends together and remember the hype of the Spice Girl era and have a pretty good laugh.
2 ||| Ten years after they first become famous, the Spice Girls recently toured again. It's all over now until they start to run low again on funds, but with their tour came a re-release of Spice World, the movie. Now I can honestly say, this film is no classic. But hey, it's good classic fun, with lots of British celebrity cameos, and bad acting (from all the Spice Girls but especially from Victoria), but it provides a few laughs.  The story is quite complicated, cos it seems to jump around quite a bit, and is extremely jumbled. Basically every plot they could think about they threw in.  I was a Spice Girls fan. I wasn't broken hearted when they 'broke up', and followed Geri when she went solo, but they were still good poppy songs, and I had all their albums. I think I still do. This was done before Geri went skinny, blonder, and didn't want to be known as a former Spice Girl. Mel B was still loud & brash, Victoria was in the early beginnings of her romance with a certain footballer, before she would take over the world (it seems that way), and Emma & Mel C seemed to have stayed remarkably the same.  There's a whole host of famous British faces in this. Gary Glitter was supposed to have a cameo, but that was quickly cut from the film when he was arrested. (But they kept in the song "Do You Want To Be In My Gang?") Other famous faces are Michael Barrymore, Meatloaf, Elvis Costello, Alan Cumming, Neil Fox (in voice only thank God), Stephen Fry, Bob Geldof, Richard E Grant, Jools Holland, Bob Hoskins, Elton John, Hugh Laurie, Roger Moore, Naoko Mori (now in Torchwood), Richard O'Brien, Jonathan Ross, Jennifer Saunders ... Phew. I bet I've missed someone out.  Spice World is one of those films that you will be embarrassed to admit you own, but it's joined by many more in my DVD collection, so I'm not embarrassed in the slightest. It's harmless fun.
2 ||| This is a highly entertaining film in which Harrison Ford plays an American president who puts his money where his mouth his. Russian dissidents who believe in the old order seize control of Air Force One, hoping that the hostages will force the Americans to persuade the Russian premier to release a prominent Russian soldier. Once released, the threat of another cold war can only be the blink of an eye away. While the White House ponders on how to deal with the situation, the president has remained on board Air Force One, determined to rescue the hostages. This is a very good fil, well-paced and well acted. The commentary by Wolfgand Peterson reveals many interesting facts about the film including the professionalism of Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman. My only complaint is about two sequences involving Air Force One - this is a personal thing. I hate action or stunt scenes which stretch credibility. The first scene, when Air Force One has just landed but the hijackers take off again is a little bit unbelievable. The second scene, at the end, is not only ridiculous and laughable, it is a very poor effect - looking as if the budget has just run out. Ironically, Wolfgang Peterson states that a lot of money was spent on this and he was impressed. Still, if you enjoy a good action film which is also an edge-of-the-seat thriller, this is a good choice.
2 ||| This movie has an interesting, action-filled plot as well as a good, but it fizzles, perhaps because the screen time lavished on the action scenes robs screen time that could have been spent on character development. Even so, in the small screen time they get, Glenn Close is convincing as the tight-jawed Vice President and Wendy Crewson scores points as a dignified First Lady, compassionate mother and loving wife.  Harrison Ford, appealingly macho as ever, occasionally distances himself from his character with a lapse into tongue-in-cheek line-readings or facial expression.  Otherwise, he is properly presidential.  As the first daughter, Liesel Matthews displays a range of emotion that many of the more seasoned supporting actors lack. One viewing will probably be enough for most people.
2 ||| This action blockbuster is a pretty fun romp. It's a little far stretched, but who says it can't be?. Director Wolfgang Petersen delivers a top notch, high octane action film that will definitley please any action film fan. Harrison Ford stars as the President Of The United States whose plane, Air Force One, is taken over in mid-air by russian terrorists. The always excellent Gary Oldman plays the lead villain, and he does it with complete scene stealing bravado. Glenn Close co-stars as the Vice President who tries to communicate with Oldman from Washington D.C. headquarters. We've seen this before, but this is a million times better than most action films that involve hostages and planes. The action is pretty high once it gets going, and the violence is all over the place. Ford is, once again, cinema's leading hero. He can be a space pirate, adventurous professor, or the President. He can make it work every time. Even if the script doesn't always hold up to his excellence. This is one of those. If you realize that this is just pure 100% adrenaline fun, then you will have a grand time watching this fun ride. Afterwards, you'll definitley be thinking 'Harrison For President!'.
0 ||| The worst film I have ever seen.  Absolutely terrible!  You can't care about any of the characters, especially those who are shot within minutes of their first appearance, and the countless explosions and bad one-liners leave you with a headache to beat the band.  After suffering through this dreck, the only thought in your head that is still audible will be, "Why, Harrison, why?"
2 ||| ...because he is one mean-old President when he gets his Irish up! When terrorists take over AirForce One, it's up to the President himself to subdue the enemy. Suspenseful from start to finish, although feminists should take umbrage at the indecisiveness displayed by the female Vice President who's willing to placate the evil-doers. Notwithstanding that, just the kind of patriotic movie to fire up every red-blooded American.
0 ||| Little more than an excuse to exploit the success of the Spice Girls, Spice World is a grossly lacking film, even for those who enjoy the music. Essentially a ripoff of The Beatles "A Hard Days Night", the Spice Girls are unfortunately not nearly as famous and their music not nearly as universally recognized. A slew of cameos and familiar supporting cast members can't save the film from its own bad dialogue, poor choreography and painful lip-syncing. Apparently everyone was in it for the paycheck.  Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth (Alan Cumming) is a documentarian desperately trying to obtain footage for his latest project, a look at the popular five-girl singing group The Spice Girls: Ginger (Geri Halliwell), Baby (Emma Bunton), Posh (Victoria Beckham), Sporty (Melanie Chisholm) and Scary (Melanie Brown). While he struggles to sneak into parties and onto sets where they practice, the girls themselves prepare for a big stage show in England. Meanwhile, their eccentric manager is in cahoots with Chief (Roger Moore) the man who feels he is responsible for their success and can take it away with a snap of his fingers, or a caress of his squealing bovine. And if that isn't enough, a mysterious paparazzi spy gets carried away snapping pictures of the fivesome and pasting it all over the headlines. To top it all off, a pair of filmmakers pitch their idea of a Spice Girl movie to studio executives, which as it turns out, is basically the very movie we're watching.  Since the story of the film is largely pointless, and little else really holds attention spans, it is easy to pick out inaccuracies and bits of concepts that don't quite add up. For starters, the girls drive around in the Spice Bus, a blue and red monstrosity that has an impossibly large interior. So impossibly large in fact, that it doesn't even pretend to make sense. Workout equipment, couches, beds and all sorts of other furniture are scattered throughout the inside of the bus, in shots that are clearly not capable of being inside the bus. And yet the filmmakers go so far as to show the flashing lights of other vehicles zipping by the bus windows, even though the realism has long since been abandoned.  While each Spice Girl physically embodies stereotypical fashions, physiques and attitudes, those characteristics don't translate over to their personalities. Either they were all scripted to be ditzy, or they're just naturally that way. Through constant daydream sequences they act out various scenarios, most of which are intended as comedy relief, despite the blatant absence of humor. Similarly, the dance and song segments arise from nonsensical situations, and they're choreographed with little self-respect, and with obnoxious elements such as an Army dance instructor and poor lip-syncing. Alan Cumming plays a character very much like we envision him to be in his everyday life, and Roger Moore embarrassingly plays a villain who strokes various furry animals and speaks in riddles, an obvious farce of his own James Bond evildoers.  With brief appearances by Elton John, Bob Hoskins and other well-known Brits, a wholeheartedly unexciting speedboat adventure, and countless attempts at failed humor, Spice World is still unable to create entertainment that reaches beyond diehard fans of the all-girl group. And even entertaining those fans is debatable. When the group revives an unconscious sick kid by suggesting that Ginger Spice take her top off, it's apparent that their true talents are not in the music.  - Mike Massie
1 ||| Britain, circa 1997.  Tony Blair is elected P.M.  Princess Di perishes.  And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public.  This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what "A Hard Days' Night" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' "Head" than I was of "A Hard Days' Night".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.  On to "From Justin to Kelly".
2 ||| Harrison Ford has always & will be one of my favorite actors,but this film is not him, I mean could terrorist actually hijack Air Force One??, & if so, wouldn't the Secret Service take out half if not all of them??? this film makes the Secret Service look like idiots, I mean coming from the director of "In the line of fire" you would think they would at least kick a**, but they are taken out very quickly, & Ford who is the president has to fend for his self,this film is disturbing in that it comes off as a way to make the viewer think that Ford is one president who can take on terrorist by his self, despite that his wife & daughter are being held hostage, Glenn Close realisticly portrays the Vice President, but comes off as a reluctant leader, the only one who is the most convincing is Gary Oldman who gives a chilling performance as the lead terrorist who has an agenda & will kill without hesitation, Ford does his best with what he has to work with, but his president is tooo perfect, which makes this film unrealistic, there has never been a perfect president, & I not sure there will ever be, what is even more disturbing is that this film borrows to heavily on the first DIE HARD, I know many films have tried to repeat the success of DIE HARD, but this one does way toooo much, not a bad film, just a worn out concept & certainly not Ford's best work.
0 ||| Compared to '97's other action smashes Con Air and Tommorow Never Dies , this meandering nonsense is the definable example of studio overbearing. It's slightly better than Face/Off maybe,but it still very poor. The action itself is slow moving and uninvolving,and nothing that hasn't been done ten times better and to more exciting effect in earlier highjack features like Passenger 57 and Under Siege. Harrison Ford is nauseatingly mundane,routine in his leading man role,doing the usual mumbling act he's done in previous action roles. He's showing his age really badly too (but he still should have got the role as Jack Ryan in The Sum of All Fears instead of Ben Affleck,dagnammit!)Meanwhile,Gary Oldman is laughably OTT as the rashan terrorist ,while Glen Close and William H. Macy are totally wasted in their roles. The story itself is completely unbelievable and insults the viewer's intelligence beyond breaking point. For one example out of many others,in one scene,Ford uses a mobile phone to make contact with Close and we all know that in real life,this would cause the plane to crash. And towards the end,it doesn't half drag on like anything,just when I thought this dire mess was coming to and end,it just went on more and more until I was close to just turning it off and walking out. For an impressive instance of Ford's action man status,check out his turns as Jack Ryan in Clear and Present Danger and Patriot Games. And sign a petition to get him as the lead in the new film,not Aptless Affleck.
1 ||| I bought this DVD in Oct./'05 for someone who ia a fan (!?!).Her B/day was just last week. She was mortified; I was pissed that even though it was/STILL IS advertised as 1.85:1 the DIC IS ONLY 1.33:1. i personally don't care but the little girl was shattered. FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!!

0 ||| Could it be the worst film ever? Possibly.  Could it be used to extract information from even the most dangerous of spies? Definitely.  Sheet torture does not even begin to explain this film. Obviously you should like the Spice Girls if you hope to enjoy this movie, but how can any sane person appericate such a contrived group of utter fakes? Those who are manipulated by our society's every whim, that's who.
2 ||| If you want to see a fun movie, that has your favorite music group on it, go right ahead. Because on a regular movie list, this is nothing but stupidity. But on a fun level, it is way up there. Because i'm sure the producers knew it wasn't going to be a hit. I'm sure the Spice Girls knew it wasn't going to be a hit. But in a way it was a hit, because it just looked like the type of movie where the makers had fun making it. Overall, if you just want something to eat popcorn to and have a few laughs, go right ahead.
0 ||| I hope they make a sequel so that Harry could go to Mars and get'em all.
0 ||| Spiceworld: The Movie is a movie starring the Spice Girls.  What....you want a plot? Sorry, there just isn't one. Well, nothing that could be coherently described as a plot, anyway. The target audience of this movie won't realize this, but what we get is a collection of music videos very very loosely tied together around a number of dismal subplots.  To give you some idea of the looseness of the subplots, some of them involved;  A snooty bumbling reporter, Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth (Alan Cumming) filming a documentary on the "real" Spice Girls. He wanders about with his moronic crew, bumping into things and falling over a lot.  A spitulous newspaper mogul, Kevin McMaxford (Barry Humphreys) whose goal is to break up the Spice Girls so that he can sell more newspapers, and his associated super sleazy press photographer.  An impotent, stressed out manager - Clifford (Richard E. Grant).  A bizarre quoter of nonsense played by Roger Moore who is supposedly the big Chief.  A very pregnant friend of the Spice Girls who goes into labour whilst dancing at a nightclub.  A movie producer (George Wendt)and writer following Clifford around pitching Spice Girl movie ideas at him which he keeps rejecting until, surprise, surprise, they pitch the idea for this movie to him, and he agrees.  Aliens that have heard of the Spice Girls and want their autographs (whilst they are in the bush looking for a place to pee). I'm not making this one up, honestly.  The movie also featured a bus with a Union Jack plastered all over it which was the Spiceworld tour bus. They must have put Dr Who's Tardis somewhere in this bus, since it was an awful lot bigger inside than outside, but never mind about that. Meatloaf drove the bus.
1 ||| This dvd was below average and we could not even watch the whole thing. It seems totally dated now.
0 ||| God! What was I thinking when I decidedto watch this movie. Oh yeah! I was a big fan of Spice Girls and I wasn't really thinking. Seriously, I expected more than this. I Thought they could have done better...MUCH BETTER! Before this movie came out, I thought it owuld be brilliant but, I am so god damn disappointed! This came out more of a stereotype of the worse movie ever. The word WHYYYYYYYY comes to mind. They have the potential to be great actress and they have blew it here! They should have gotten a better script.
2 ||| Everybody has something that they enjoy and just can't explain.  They might even be a little embarassed to admit that they like it.  Well, I'm not embarassed to admit that the Spice Girls are one of my guilty pleasures.  Granted, their music may be a little hokey, but they sure are fun to listen to.  In "Spice World," the girls take on a world tour with Bond-esque style.  This movie isn't fantastic, but it is fun enough for the whole family to watch.  It's silly, it's goofy, and, at times, it is brilliant.  You get a feel of what these ladies had to put up with on a daily basis, albeit in a grand and over-the-top style.  There are cameos abound in this flick as well.  The acting isn't that bad and the girls seemed to enjoy making the movie. Funny moments abound in this flick, but some of my personal favorites are when the girls first get on their tour bus and they complain about how hot it is.  They say that they could use a fan and, in perfect British comedic style, a young, pre-teen girl comes through the door screaming with glee and then runs back out the door.  The girls sigh with comfortable relief.  Another funny moment is the expensive, special-effects laden tour-bus jumping a draw-bridge with Posh behind the wheel scene.  Finally, in the end credits, the girls "interact" with the audience. They remark on people making out, wonder why folks watching their video can't find anything good on the "telly" and audience member clothes.  The entire movie is just a fun little trip. Alan Cumming(X-Men 2, Josey and the Pussycats) takes a turn as a reporter attempting to document the lives of these ladies.  George Wendt(Norm, of 'Cheers' fame)is a movie producer looking for a film to put the girls in and cash in on their fame.  Meatloaf is the bus driver for the girls.  Some of the better-known cameos that American audiences will recognize are Elton John, Bob Hoskins and Roger Moore.  If you're a die-hard fan of British film and television, you'll recognize many of the other cameos as well. The only reason I'm giving this movie three stars is because,obviously, this movie isn't for everyone.  In fact, many people might think that this movie is just too silly to watch.  On my personal scale, I would give this flick four stars for the simple fact that I love to watch it and because the Spice Girls don't take themselves too seriously in the movie. Overall, this is a silly, blatantly cheesy movie that lets you laugh at and with the Spice Girls.  They poke fun at themselves and have a good time doing it.  A good movie to watch when you have a little time to kill or just want to forget about the world(but not the 'Spice World') for awhile.
0 ||| One of the most important aspects of a movie like this is for the  film to make you actually care about the people who are held hostage.  This film failed miserably in this endevour.  If they'd killed everyone onboard, including Ford, I couldn't have cared less.  You may get the idea I didn't like this film... and you would be mistaken.  It's not that I didn't like it... ...it's that I DESPISED it. Complete TRIPE, with final "cliffhanging" sequence that is so hilariously moronic it had me laughing uncontrollably.
0 ||| This film is a real dissapointment.  Harrison Ford gives a credible performance as the President and Gary Oldman pulls off his villain role with panache.  But this movie simply doesn't work.  Overall the film is completely illogical and frankly a bit too patriotic, especially for someone who comes from Europe.  Maybe logic isn't exactly what people are looking for when they watch a "no-brainer", but this film is really too much.
1 ||| I still don't understand why everybody seems to love Air Force One so much.  First of all, the ground-based subplot with Glenn Close as the vice president is boring and just detracts from the movie's momentum.  Also, it's kind of interesting that the evil Secret Service agent tries to kill Harrison Ford at the end, even though none of the other villains are left to expose him and he could walk away without ever being suspected.  There was some scene that actually explained WHY that guy was betraying the president, but thanks to some boneheaded editing it was cut out of the movie and that character was reduced to just another stock villain.  In addition, almost all of the action sequences are sick mockeries of reality.  Granted, I can sort of go along with having that much random automatic gunfire on an airplane without losing cabin pressure.  But it's just ridiculous when the characters stand next to a big open hatch without getting sucked out into the sky and their hair just blows in the wind like they're standing in front of a movie studio fan.  And the most unintentionally funny moment has to be when the plane crashes-- the whole shot, one of the most awful CG effects I've seen in a big studio movie, is pathetic and kind of sad.  I don't understand why this film has been so successful and popular, especially since we've all seen MUCH better action movies from directors like James Cameron and John McTiernan.  Cameron could make a better movie than this standing on his head.  Sure the DVD is a nice way to show off your sound system, but there's something seriously wrong if you consider that reason enough to go out and buy this movie...
2 ||| To look at "Air Force One" at surface value would do it justice.  There is no deeper meaning, hidden emotion, political statement, or anything along the lines of what makes a movie great.  Above all, it is far  from showing the directing talent Peterson proved in "Das Boot."  AFO isn't a BAD movie.  It's just not a GOOD movie either.  "Das  Boot" was a classic.  "In the Line of Fire" was a pretty  good movie.  AFO comes in last.  The movie was filled with impressive  action sequences, but that is not the reason people go out to see movies  anymore.  Take "Wild Wild West" for a recent example.  On the  defense for the movie, Gary Oldman does a good job as a POed pro-Soviet  Russian idealist tyring to free a profound Soviet officer from a Russian  prison.  That part is not far fetched.  There are quite a few profound  pro-Soviet factions in Russia.  Many of them have high powers in the  government.  The idea that the next in command leader of one of them can  manage to hijack Air Force One with the mysterious help of the Secret  Service (hmm...maybe his reason for joining them will be in the Special  Edition) is where the plot becomes ridiculous.  As always, Harrison Ford  plays...Han Solo.  How he manages to be one of my favorite actors still  puts me at awe.  Despite its obvious flaws, AFO has its moments of  intensity and remains action-packed throughout.  I wouldn't rush out to buy  this one, but it is definitely a good rental.
0 ||| My amazon friend Mr Buckeley just wrote a great 1-star review for this, so I just felt like it too... Needless to say, in 97-98,, i don't think I could've lived through a worst fad than THIS one... i mean it was like you didn't have to be anywhere NEAR a TV or radio and you would still hear the hellish sound of "If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends" or "Stop right now, thank you very much".... god it was horrid... This was back when I was around 13-14, when I wasn't really into music as much as I am now, but I did like Rob Zombie a lot, and he was just PERFECT to get that trash out of my head! Onto this movie... If you want a movie about a GOOD British band, check out "This IS Spinal Tap" well at least the Spice Girls didn't call theirselves 'punk', unlike another band that rhymes with Hood Farlette.... and ill admit that Ginger was hottt... and smart to leave the group....
0 ||| ...but not enough to be able to stand this mind-numbing, annoying, ditzy, unintellegent, preposterous, discreditable throw-away of a movie that was no more than an attempt to cash in on a pointless late '90s fad. (I admit I had a crush on Baby Spice, but other that that, BLEECCCCHHHHH.) Right about when these talentless hacks became popular, I was in fifth grade, and every girl in my class (plus a couple of guys...) had to have EVERYTHING with their stupid faces on it. Me and my friends were starting to get into nu-metal like KoRn and Wimp Bizkit (hey, we were in fifth grade, give us a break), and everywhere you went, you got attacked by a bunch of prissy peabrains running around going "GIRL POWER!!!!" Oy vey. Well, that's okay. Thank god that these mental midgets are no longer around to sully the media any further. This garbage, along with those ever-annoying Hansons, get my vote for the worst fads of the late '90s. Both "acts" are illogical, dull-witted, implausible, unreasoned, muddled, stupid, cloddish, thickheaded, nettlesome, maddening, harassing, and just plain flat out a waste of some perfectly good blank DVD's/CD's. Nobody likes/cares about them anymore (no, not even the girls in my class), so now they are out of sight, and out of mind forever. But all kidding aside, what are we going to do with J. Lo??
2 ||| When a group that's the real flavour of the moment decides to make a movie, it'll either be a total success or a total flop, depending upon how universally-loved the group is.  The Beatles are hands down the most successful (Hard Day's Night, Help!) due to their immortalized status.  Others have not been so, e.g. Herman's Hermits, Bill Haley.  The Spice Girls kind of fall inbetween the two. The primary influence is probably A Hard Day's Night.  Spiceworld is, after all, a day in the life of the Girls, and includes  musical numbers, an uptight manager, and a triumphant concert number.  Needless to say, it will never stand side-by-side with the Beatles' groundbreaking classic. One credit in their favour is the scene where they parody their own personalities.  Victoria, for example, can't decide whether to wear the black Gucci dress, the black Gucci dress, or the black Gucci dress in her closet.  To which Emma successfully suggests, "why don't you wear the black Gucci dress?"  Emma's baby-like innocence is also parodied.  And Geri's misquote on the Pope is a parody of what John Lennon said about Jesus. They seem to have the most fun trying on different costumes in the "Saturday Night Divas" number.  Geri as Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch and Wonder Woman shines out in particular, as do Mel C. and Geri as Danny and Sandy from Grease, and Victoria as Honey Rider in Dr. No.  But the best is when some of them dress up as each other. There are some subplots along the way, such as a documentary team following the Girls, the Girls' very pregnant friend Nicola who pops up every now and then, and a tabloid publisher who hates the girls so much, he hatches a plot to tarnish their image.  The tensions between the girls and their uptight manager Clifford, and an American film producer (George Wendt of Cheers) who consults Clifford to discuss a movie deal involving the girls.  Their Spice Force Five idea (think Spice Girls as Charlie's Angels) is actually a good segment. There are amusing guest cameos from well-known British actors and singers, such as Richard Briers, Hugh Laurie (Wooster in Jeeves and Wooster), Stephen Fry (Jeeves in J and W), Bob Geldof, Elvis Costello, Elton John, and AbFab's Jennifer Saunders. I doubt if Roger Moore would consider this movie as his best performance, but he seems to be enjoying himself as the Girls' behind-the-scenes handler, with some really hideous lines:  "The drummer without sticks has no backbeat."  Richard E. Grant though gets noteworthy mention as Clifford.  The scene of him having a real fit at seeing tabloid headlines bashing the girls is funny, but the girls laugh it off and even make fun of him, which makes him even madder.  Meat Loaf is Dennis, the Girls' loyal bus driver, and there's an in-joke when he's asked to add repairing the bus-toilet to his list of duties.  "I love those girls.  I'll do anything for them, but I won't do that."  Hint:  his last hit single. The performances in this movie may depend upon which Spice Girl is your favourite.  In my case, it's Geri, Emma, and Mel C. in that order, but love or hate the movie, all the Spice Girls are still very charming and lovable.  Songs done in this movie in order:  "Too Much", "Do It", "Say You Will Be There", "Mama", "Denying", "Saturday Night Divas", "Stop", "2 Become 1", "Leader Of The Gang", "Never Give Up On The Good Times", "My Boy Lollipop", "Wannabe", "Viva Forever", "Who Do You Think You Are", "Spice Up Your Life", and "The Lady Is A Vamp." Had I reviewed this in the throes of my Spice-induced euphoria of 1998, I would have given this the max.  Time though, has not been so generous, but at least the quintet left behind a movie showing them at their peak.
2 ||| Do you like cheese? If yes the movies for you.  Air Force one has all the action you need for a saturday night but it is just to cheesy.  Think I'm overexagerating you're right I am the only really cheesy thing is when  Mr. Ford says "Get off my plane". The movie was great until then  and I'm thinkin (sarcastically) that's the best way to highlight a climax.  Let us face it, that is a cheesy line. If you said no to the cheese  factor.  Its still a good movie that teaches an important lesson about  caring for your family more than anything (the spread of communism for  example). If you don't like sensitive messages then see it because it has  got some violence you will enjoy.
0 ||| I hated the Spice Girls before this movie and then I hated them even more after I saw it. Stupid,boring and dull only a child under the age of 10 would like this huge mess.
2 ||| If you are a fan of the Spice Girls your may like this movie.  The script is kind of boring and the acting performance of the girls are not great, just okay, well they acting like themself but Geri (Ginger Spice) My God she CAN'T act!  She can't sing also, what she's doing in a girls band and now in an movie???  Well she do have charisma and good stage presence, she is an interesting person, I guess that mostly why she is in the Spice Girls, she is driven but she sure can't sing, I sing better then her and I think I sing bad.lol:)  Well like I said if you like the Spice Girls you may like this movie, it got funny part in it but it's not the movie of the year.
2 ||| Air Force One!  Typical blockbuster movie with material that everyone would've seen one time or another.  The one thing that pulls it through however is the fact that they have Harrison Ford in the lead.  Unfortunately, this doesn't help the Devil's Own!   Are we actually  meant to feel sorry for the plight of a terrorist?  Even though it's a  fellow country man, no-one would condone the killing of innocent people.  This appears to be what Harrison's character struggles with in this movie  as he has a dilema of wethering to kill Pitt or not.   This movie may  go down well in America due to strong Irish roots, but in Britain, where  these acts of terrorism were faced on a weekly basis, it will bomb.   This double pack is good value for money and I can see it going down really  well with Harrison Ford fans.  The sad fact is though, these two movies,  just like Seven Days, Seven Nights' are designed for the cinema.  Good on  the big screen, wouldn't want to own them though!
1 ||| In a grand attempt to instill a healthy dose of national fear during these glory days of booming economy and virtual peace, Air Force One puts Harrison Ford in the only good guy-type role he has left to play--dream President of the U.S. of A. AFO, like those Clancy-based  political-actioners, is technically pretty snazzy. But it also suffers from  a ham-fisted arrogance.  I mean, who would have thought we'd actually see a  movie where the prez himself becomes the super-dude (Bilbo Clinton would  need to cut down on the cheeseburgers, lose the gray, and run four million  laps around the White House to be up to such a task). The minor  cleverness of AFO stems from director Wolfgang Peterson's ability to set an  unbelievable situation squarely in the realm of the possible, kind of.  Sometimes it works, but the apple pie propaganda gets pretty gooey,  especially toward the end.  A Presidential sounding horn section plays in  the background every time Marshall kicks a vodka-drinking scuzball in the  groin, and the brow-beating of the first family becomes a melodramatic  hoot. That's AFO in a nutshell: simple-minded jingoism masked as  escapist adventure.
0 ||| This movie sucks, simple as that.  There's no reason to watch and only god know's why it even made a dollar at the box office.  Completely useless.  I would go on, but it upsets me even thinking about that god-awefull movie again.
0 ||| Spice world is nothing but a waste of time. I will not reccomend it. So go out and do somethingwith your time. Don't watch this super-stupid movie!
0 ||| If it's not then it's got be be close to it.  This is just horrible!  There is nothing more to say about it.
2 ||| Starring the British girl-power band formerly known as the Spice Girls, Spice World is better than anyone has any right to expect. Even the most hardened Spice-hater (of which I am definitely one) should find something to like. The tongue-in-cheek approach taken by Spice World is what makes the movie work. The Spice Girls, while not Oscar-caliber actresses, do manage to pull off their roles with relative panache. (It helps that they're playing themselves.) However, there are frequent musical numbers, which (unless you're a fan of the Spice Girls' music) are painful to listen to. Times like this are what the mute button is made for. All in all, an amusing, if forgettable movie.
0 ||| The Spice Girls have proved all critics wrong and although individually their vocals are thin and lack range and power, they have made some instantly memroable recordings and likewise their solo releases have been fairly good too given to prove that you don't really seem to have to have much singing power these days. This film is little more than extended concert footage with silly and painfully unfunny sequences linked to them. None of the girls could act their way out of a wet paper bag but i'm sure they don't care as they certainly made lots of money from this. Fans will be delighted whilst others will just gauge at how dross like this can be made and earn big money.
2 ||| I admit that this movie was good but it is no "Hard Days Night". Spice Girls tried to copy many things that were in HDN, for example, lateness for a concert. They made it seem as if they were trying to do the same thing that the Beatles did over thirty years earlier.
0 ||| The schlockmeisters, from Hollywood, have surpassed themselves with this offering. It needs more than suspension of disbelief to be entertained here, a full-frontal lobotomy is almost a prerequisite.  It is so over-the-top and patently absurd in its action sequences that it actually can't rate as a movie in the genre of a thriller; it's more like a self-parody of an action movie. What's missing is the canned laughter to give this movie some form of legitimacy and classification as to what the producer had in mind when he dished this up to the public.  Yes, every respectable critic has alluded to the spraying of hundreds of rounds machinegun fire inside a pressurised cabin of a 747, but what we have here is a President who's a  master of armed and unarmed combat; an Avionics Engineer -  a man adept at doing anything in a crisis situation. We can also add: the perfect, caring and reassuring father and husband; maybe, we can include gynaecologist to his rather impressive list of credentials as well.  This guy can hang outside a plane flying at 550mph at 38,000ft in -60 degrees Centigrade - if you're not impressed with that, we also see him standing upright on the plane's wing.  Gary Oldman has played the arch villain once too often, his  acting is becoming banal, predictable and synthetic; it's almost as if he doesn't believe in his character anymore - he's simply bored by the  monotonous, one-dimensional, stereotyped role of the baddie.  As for the role of Glenn Close as V.P. - she should know better. The scenes in the war room with the false sentiments of angst, anticipation, anxiety and, finally, overwhelming relief and joy...... it was cringingly awful.  Somehow, I can't help but think, that those viewers who raved  about this movie spend their vacation in the Grand Canyon searching for  conclusive proof that the coyote is still chasing after the Roadrunner.
0 ||| I'm begining to understand why The Beatles left England.  This movie is the cinematic equivilant of watching paint dry.  Here, at last, is a movie where one can miss 30 minutes of it and not miss any plot points.  It's the  kind of movie you shouldn't buy snacks for because there's no telling how  long they'll stay down.  This flick is as contrived and mindless as their  music.  But I suppose the point is that they made lots of money -- they  certainly got my brother's [money].  I suppose it's my own fault for  watching it. A good veiwing tip would be a full-frontal lobotomy.  Spice up  your life....
2 ||| It's not on my fave list or anything, but it is my type of movie!  I guess I was a closet fan or something, but I just love the campness of them and the outfits!  There were some really fun parts in the film, like when they  swapped roles, and dressed up as their favourite idols. (Nothing like  playing dress-ups!) I loved it when they sang the old Gary Glitter song.  They made fun of themselves a little, which is always a good thing.  They  may not be the most talented or gorgeous beings in the world, but at least  they don't make you want to die of sadness like a lot of acts today do  (well, depending on who you are!)  There's a need for more musicals in the  world, I think, and this is the closest we've gotten to one in the last  fifteen years...
2 ||| Spice World is actually a very hilarious film. It makes fun of the Spice Girls and the world they live in. It's also done in the spirit of A Hard Day's Night. Everyone in the film is great, and it's a nice surprise to see  some notable Brits like Elton John and Jennifer Saunders in the film. Don't  take the movie seriously, it's meant to be fun and silly. Also, this is one  of the rare momments you will see Geri Halliwell with the group. It is  definately a guilty pleasure, and fun to watch!
2 ||| Although the film is a bit dated, it is worth watching for Kim Basinger's performance as an illiterate bayou girl.  Compare this performance with the super smart callgirl in LA Confidential -- she does have range.  Buy it used at the cheapest price -- you won't be disappointed.
2 ||| Richard Gere is the tough Chicago cop who goes to the Big Easy to track down the killer of his partner. This killer is a much feared hood in New Orleans named Losado. While down there Gere runs into Kim Basinger, a "slave" of Losado's, and he becomes determined to free her as well as kill Losado. This is all very typical thriller fare, although it can be pretty suspenseful at times--especially in the bayous and, of course, the big ending where Gere gets his man in a nail-biting shoot out and fire. But after you've seen this, ask yourself the next day how much you can remember. Note: There's a scene in the picture that's stolen directly from Hitchcock's "The 39 Steps": Gere and Basinger are handcuffed together as they make their escape through the swamps.
1 ||| No Mercy is one of those films that is not really that bad, but it leaves you wondering how did they get big stars to do it.  In the film Richard Gere plays a tough New York cop with a drinking habit, an ex-wife, and a bad rep.  So what happens to him?  Well his good natured partner (you know the one with the with the wife and kids and a good reputation a.k.a has everything to lose) gets murdered when Gere takes a tip from a local hood that a hit is about to go down.  So the film turns into the rouge cop on the revenge trail story.  This will bring him to New Oreans(that whole "fish-out-of-water" thing), and to Kim Basinger.  Along the way Gere will encounter lots of bad guys, bullets, cops who don't like him, swamps, crawfish, and cajons(sp?) all to a hip 80's soundtrack. This film was the first pairing of Richard Gere and Kim Basinger together and to it's credit it is better than there second film, Final Analysis.  However there really isn't much going on here.  The plot was as predictable as traffic at five o'clock.  Neither Gere nor Basinger is very good which is Richard Pearce's(the director) fault because they fall in and out of their accents.  I have to say though there is something about Richard Gere that even in his weaker films, like this one, he is still fun to watch.  The same can be said for Basinger who is always delightful on the eyes even when she is hard on the ears. This film has it's momments, but they are pretty sparse.  Maybe Richard and Kim will get it right on the third try since they seem to like doing this type of film together. If you're out there looking for some steamy action you might want to look elsewhere.
2 ||| Good
2 ||| The initial idea is not bad but the story fails to really engage because the main character is not a moral man. He is basically a jerk who only cares about taking REVENGE for his murdered partner. It's NOT about saving a woman from slavery or protecting society from a dangerous murderer/criminal. And the attraction towards him by Kim Basinger's character is just sad - he slaps her, says nasty rude things that only an abused woman like her would be willing to overlook. Hence I don't want to root for him to get her, he does not deserve it in the slightest. As for the action part of the movie, it's OK but not great. Early on I had to cringe at a glaring faux pas of the film makers - he puts hand-cuffs on his LEFT hand and her RIGHT hand but when they get into a car she is sitting on his right side and yet he is able to drive completely unencumbered! Come on - could've made some effort to make it more realistic! Bottom line - action is ok, acting is not bad (Jeroen Krabbe is great as a villain) but the story itself does not fully engage and falls flat at the end. It's important to have a hero at the core of such a genre - think Lethal Weapon or Die Hard. The main reason we love these characters and are willing to forgive their unconventional methods is because they fight the GOOD fight and check their egos at the door. But this does not happen in "No Mercy".
1 ||| As seeing the title, I expected a really tough action movie but it wasn't. It was a tapid action movie. Either actors are not charming enough to rule the running time and the soundtrack was old and just noisy. The chemistry between two actors are almost none. I don't know why I spent almost 10$ plus shipping cost for this DVD. i feel regret.
2 ||| It was a little gloomy, but I liked it anyway.  Richard Gere is one of my favorites.
2 ||| Good movie.
2 ||| I liked this movie. Basinger is, as always, good at playing what appears to be a weak victim who gains her strength. Gear is good, as usual.
2 ||| Ok
1 ||| Did not care for this movie.  The parts of Bassinger and Gere were okay, however I didn't care for the story.
0 ||| I was going to get this to see it again for nostalgia. After reading the reviews it seems Amazon is having us pay for lesser quality viewing. After reading the reviews I also realized that many of the digital purchases we have made on Amazon are also horrible quality as we rate the quality when asked. Why does a money monster like Amazon have to stick it to its customers like this?  Because clearly, we are taking it lying down and we give Amazon loads of money for bootleg quality products. Maybe Jeff Bezos should get the same "invitation" Zuckerberg just got to answer some questions under oath.
2 ||| Bought as a Xmas gift.
1 ||| This review is NOT about the movie as it is five plus stars. It is about the blu ray from Twilight Time. I have the DVD and just received the blu ray. For some unknown reason Columbia Pictures never issued this as a blu ray, so Twilight Time did. Normally I have been pleased with Twilight Time releases (HINT: all their releases are far far cheaper on their website, as I just found) as well as Criterion Collection releases. Honestly, Criterion is the best of all of them...Criterion, Twilight, Shout! Factory and Scream! Factory.  This is FAR FAR from a blu ray. I still own the DVD release and will continue to do so. There is absolutely NO difference between the blu ray and the Columbia DVD both in video and audio. I mean NONE. In fact, the blu ray is darker in tone then is the DVD. The darker tone does not account for a richer deeper picture, it is just dark. The DVD has a much brighter picture and the color at times appears sharper.  Perhaps there is a reason why Columbia never issued this as a blu ray. If their reason was because the negative would not transfer well, I certainly understand--as it clearly does not.
2 ||| Review of "Steel Magnolias" Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017  There are so many reasons to watch Steel Magnolias, and once youve watched it, you can cross it off your classics to watch list and move on to the next one.  Youll appreciate the large cast (Shirley MacLaine, Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis, Sally Field, Daryl Hannah, Tom Skerritt, Sam Shepard, Dylan McDermott) and youll get a kick out seeing Julia Roberts in the movie just before she donned knee high boots for Pretty Woman. And yes, youll laugh and shed a tear, but then youll survive. This isn't Terms of Endearment.  Steel Magnolias will appeal to the Fried Green Tomatoes, Crimes of the Heart, and August: Osage County. In other words, its a movie about a bunch of Southern women muddling through life, with a little tragedy, a few chuckles, and a sweet tea or two. If you like those types of movies, add this to your weekend watch list and start popping that corn!
2 ||| Good stars, predictable plot.
2 ||| got as a gift for some one good price
2 ||| Ok
2 ||| A Classic Movie !
2 ||| Good movie.
0 ||| Like others have said, I've heard a lot about this movie but have never seen it. Well, it was on cable last night and I couldn't make it past the first 35 minutes - quite possibly the worst 'movie' that I've ever seen.  Not the "dope" (though they smoke it enough), just dopey beyond words. It is terrible in every production, script, and acting category that you can think of.  This is the only 'film' I'd rate a zero if I could.
2 ||| did not care for it, was too drawn out. the only good part was the ending though was sad.
2 ||| An A-list cast and sleek Hollywood production values can't overcome the fact this film adaptation sucks a good deal of the life and feeling out of the play on which it is based.  Attempts to "open up" the story by leaving the beauty parlor set which was the location of the play and adding male characters only dilute the material.  The most egregious mistake is showing the death of one of the characters, rather than allowing us to experience it though the originally powerful final monologue of another character.  This makes that monologue (significantly cut) anticlimactic.  A tacked-on feel good "the cycle of life continues" coda  only makes the petering out of energy more pronounced.  Performances range from good (Sally Field) to phoned in (Olympia Dukakis) to perfectly dreadful (Shirley McLaine).  A good example of how "the industry" can botch good material.
2 ||| It was OK
0 ||| Disappointed in the entire movie. I thought I would be watching a classic. I could barely make it through to the end.  The only good part was the few minutes that Jack Nicholson appeared in the film.  Again,  I was very disappointed in this movie.  It was a total waste of money.
2 ||| Its an old low budget cult movie............
0 ||| The streaming was horrible.
1 ||| It must have been a slow year for movies because I do not see what people saw in this one.  Music, for the most part was good
0 ||| Had to watch a lot of fluff to get to anything with content  Just not my kind of show. Acting was good
0 ||| My whole life (I'm over 50) I've read about how great this movie was supposed to be. I never really thought about it till after I watched this but not once in my lifetime had I ever actually heard somebody I know say they liked this movie. Now I know why.  I already know what all the fans of the movie would say to me. How they don't even want to waste their breath on somebody as ignorant as me or I had to be alive during the times. Well that argument isn't going to hold any water with me. I admit my favorite genre is science fiction but one of my favorite genre's is also drive-in movies of the 50's, 60's and 70's to which this movie belongs along with many Roger Corman movies.  I don't know how much I can say that hasn't already been said both by lovers of the movie and critics. I don't know what the movie critics were thinking. There is no way that today a movie like this would garner positive reviews. Not with the internet being what it is. I suppose many movie critics of the time were part of the hippie generation and were liberal minded. Even so, I don't know how you can possibly think this was a good movie.  After the first 5 minutes it was all downhill from there. There is nothing exceptional about this movie. I've seen much better biker movies or better movies of any genre you want to classify this as. The direction is poor. There is a reason nobody would give Dennis Hopper a job for a long time after this. His next movie was a bomb and I think Hollywood realized he just go lucky with the reviews. The editing is poor also. There are several inconsisticies. The acting is well below average also. Not to mention the 'locals' they used didn't help matters. While I was watching it I said to myself "I'll bet they just used local people, these people can't act" and sure enough I learned that's exactly what they did. It ends terribly and I learned nothing other than the hippie movement was a waste of time. There is nothing in this movie that stands the test of time. It appears to be a movie about a bunch of losers who did nothing with their lives. I don't want to make this sound like a political discussion but what good is all this 'freedom' they talk about so for you if you do nothing with it other than to live like an animal. Then again I don't spend my life smoking weed either so I guess I'll never understand.  The movie is boring, poorly acted, poorly directed, poorly edited, plot starts OK and slowly goes nowhere. In a way it reminded me of 'The Incredible Shrinking Man.' Eventually the main protagonist shrinks to nothingness. Same as this movie.  Unless they find all that lost footage and make this into a better movie, I will never watch it again and consider it a lesson learned. I have no idea what the AFI was thinking when they included this in their 100 greatest movies.  This opinion is not coming from the younger generation who just want to see action. I actually like slow movies, independent movies....low budget movies in particular. But this one is just ridiculous. I'll admit that movies sometimes seem worse when you have expectations (opposite is true too) but this one is just flat out ridiculously boring and it teaches you nothing despite it's pretentiousness. Just look at Dennis Hopper. Typical from the generation and he is just a burn out. Listen to the commentary on the additional making of feature. They talk about him ranting and raving about the government and how they knew what they were doing when making the movie. He sounds like a raving idiot.  The only good thing that came out of this was that Jack Nicholson got himself recognized. The only decent actor in the movie.  I couldn't be more disappointed when watching a movie.  Recommended for people who just have to see every movie on AFI's 100 greatest films. There is no other reason to watch this other than to use this movie as an example of the saying, "opinion's are like ........ everybody has one."
2 ||| Classic!!!!
1 ||| Very average and way to sad for me
2 ||| I quit watching before it was over.  There wasn't enough substance to keep my interest.
1 ||| It starts off very slowly, and, of course, due to the timeframe when it was made would not be understood by young people today.  I skipped ahead towards the end to see if it would improve before watching the entire movie, and it has a terrible ending, so I didn't watch the whole movie.  It was donated to a thrift store.
0 ||| Had to watch for a college research paper assignment.  Would have never watched if not required.  Is considered to be a great movie but I hated it.  The acting is sub par and the hippies are awkward camera tricks are not impressive although maybe for LSD times they were considered cool.
0 ||| Most boring movie I have seen in tears. Could hardly understand the actors southern accents. What a waste of good talent.
0 ||| Do yourself a favor and don't lose your time with a low quality movie.
0 ||| I never was able to watch this movie.  I kept getting error messages.
0 ||| don't show this to any one especially your kids lots of drugs and sex
2 ||| not up todays standards
1 ||| if your a collector  you will want this; idem. but as far as entertaining.  its actually poorly done
2 ||| A reminder of what the drug culture is like.
2 ||| Ok for the time and definitely at the top end for the genre. I was disappointed by the ending when it first came out and all these years later it's still a disappointment. There are good scenes in the movie and the cast is excellent. The storyline wanders quite a bit. The sound track is filled with classics of the time.
1 ||| Bored
2 ||| I never saw this movie when it came out.  It was ok but I was not that impressed.  I remember people talking about this movie but it was not as good as I remember them saying it was.  I might have liked it better back in wilder times.
2 ||| I really thought I would enjoy this movie, as I had seen it years ago when I was a pothead, But with all the cussing in it, it was a disappointment.
1 ||| Not the classic I thought it would be
2 ||| Recently I've been catching up on some cult movies that I haven't seen. This was one of them.  Like some others, this reminded me of why I hadn't seen it before. Cult movie, or not, it's only so-so.  This was too self-absorbed for me. I can't quite put a finger on it. It's just like fingernails slowly scraped against a chalkboard. I kept wanting to yell "stop!" at them.  I expected much better cinematography. Given the locations, it should have been easy to do.  The ending was somewhat predictable, but it was done third-rate. Given the gravity of the situation, seems like more effort would have been put into making it realistic.
0 ||| B movie at its best
2 ||| Good storyline, but it's very fluffy. Sally Field does much better acting than Julia Roberts, proving that experience counts. Tom Skerrit's character is a very stupid husband/father and not realistic at all. It was fun to watch.
0 ||| I saw this movie when it first came out - 1969.  I thought it was vapid/self absorbed and just plain dopey.  2 losers set out on their idiotic Capt. America harleys - after their drug deal-  on a half witted soul search.  There's a scene with a "commune"- a commune of bunch of nit wits.  Stinks.  The sound track is good and that's about it.  By the way as you watch the idealistic commune life- remember about 2 months after the release of this movie there was another famous hippie commune in 1969 - led by Charles Manson.
0 ||| No comment
2 ||| A bunch of women in Louisiana interact as one of their daughters is getting married. They continue to interact after the daughter dies. It is supposed to be one of those "southern themed" shows of the late 80s/90s that was pretty persistent in American culture then for whatever reason. Anyway, it was almost as if this movie tried to make being southern "hip"/"cool". They were portrayed as foul, immoral, eccentric air heads. Dunno. Maybe there was still some of the typical US socio-economic put down in there. Who knows? Anyway, the movie is over the top with this drama and sensationalism. I mean I have known people with diabetes before. Some who died from it as they had a horrific life with it--uncontrollable. But I have never seen any take a fit smacking at their new hair do like the Roberts character did. Just goofy. Kinda laugh out loud. Anyway, the one "Christian" in the movie was of course just an "embarrassment annoyance" designed to frame such people as such. We of course get to see Sally Field cry AGAIN. We get to see the tear jerking moment of when a husband signs away his wife's life by consenting to have her "unplugged"--we humans sure do have such hard choices in life don't we--at least according to liberals.
2 ||| Had heard and read references to this movie for years. Was kind'a disappointed . Didn't have much of a story line and I didn't think the acting was all that great. But, that's just me.
1 ||| Okay flic if you yourself are a stonner or newage-hippie, but overall I was far from impressed with the quality of its story-line. The ending was even worse. What is the meaning of the whole thing don't go riding in hillbilly hoods, karma, bad things happen to everyone who doesn't obey cookie cutter suburban life, or s*** happens only look out for yourself?
0 ||| This is not a legit Blu Ray release. The picture and sound quality are both very poor. I should have done my research. It seriously looks like some one burned the DVD to a Bluray. VERY DISAPPOINTED.
2 ||| I recently watched the flick again after not seeing it for many years. I did see when it first came out. It was the movie to see if you were of a certain age. But I didn't like it much then, and I feel about the same now. However, I did like the scenes of the American southwest as it is my favorite place to vacation. But the central theme of the movie: freedom? Uh, no thanks. Living that kind of life is just as deadening as any traditional way of life you can think of. Constantly getting high and saying "groovy man" ? Sorry. And the two main characters, Wyatt and Billy, are actually criminal drug-smugglers. But of course to the geniuses at Rolling Stone and other leftist, counter-culture outlets, they were "heroes" who were thumbing their noses at  America and the man. The South really takes it on the chin with the climax of the movie and all the scenes in-between. Jack Nicholson's career was kick-started (ha, ha) by this flick, but his oft-quoted line about people hating Wyatt and Billy because they represented freedom is a crock. Most adults looked at hippies as drug-addled lunatics who were wasting their lives. Which they were. Another myth left over from the sixties is that most kids were hippies like the dolts in the commune. The fact is only a tiny percentage of kids (less than 5%) were hippies. So as an entertaining medium Easy Rider barely satisfies. It's interesting to me for reasons other than being a realistic movie. Which it isn't.  But as far as being a great flick...no way MAAAAAAAAN!!!
2 ||| Sound on the disk was not good.
2 ||| It was an okay film. I not mad that I watched it. I was a little surprised that so many people feel as though it is a classic. I felt that the production value was really kind of low and the editing was terrible. The story was interesting but  enough because it showed a glimpse of what the 60's counter culture was like. And I assume it was accurate because people that spent their formative years in the 60's seem to enjoy this film. Over all I can just say that it was just okay.
1 ||| I remember watching this at the drive in when I was a teen.  Thought it was the coolest ever.  Although I still love the premiss of crossing the country on cycles, this seemed like a much better movie in the 60's.
2 ||| This movie was originally released when I was around 12 years old, my parents took me to see it, back then I didn't really understand much of the movie, to this day, I kind of get the intended message, but in spite of a great cast of young actors it just sort of went about it's still semi-convoluted message of personal freedoms and generational conflict in a round about way.  Some of the music was awesome, the music really tied the scenes together, but seeing a young Jack Nicholson and Dennis Hopper was a rush.  Again, it's okay, maybe serious baby boomers and Vietnam era guys will have a different read than I do.  The music was great and some of the cinematography was good.  Honestly, the soundtrack was the best part for me, maybe I'm still that 12 year old kid looking at that era from the outside.
2 ||| It's what you expect.  Young Jack Nicholson.  Doesn't end well.  Ten more words are required so I'm adding this sentence.
1 ||| I loved this movie when it was first released so I thought I would love it again.  It is so dated I don't know that younger people would "get it".  Watching it now a good deal of it seemed...well, silly for a lack of a better word.  I am torn between giving it a 2 or a 3 but I had to rate in on my impression now.
1 ||| They say this is a classic. I guess I can see why, but I truly did not like this movie. Way too indie for me. Too many artsy undertones. And it was like one big music video.
2 ||| this movie really gets much more credit than it deserves but does offer some entertainment value. hippies and motorcycles never really mixed well and this movie is an example. the saving grace of the music is the music soundtrack. the plot is weak, predictable and as non sensible as the very stoned jack nicholson.
0 ||| I don't have too much to say about this movie, mostly because I already wasted too much time simply watching it - I'm not going to waste even more time detailing out the many reasons why I hated it. I just wanted to add my 1-star rating in the hopes of lowering the average. Hopper and Nicholson have performed better on their respective crappers. (I'm not a fan of Fonda's.) This movie was about as bad as watching a stranger's home video of their toddler's first trip to the petting zoo.
2 ||| I have mixed feelings. It's an interesting movie. Positives are beautiful country and good music and some entertaining parts. negatives are nothing really happens. it drags on...
2 ||| I was eager to see the movie again but time has not been kind to it.  Jack Nicholson's performance was still great and a lot of fun to watch but his time is brief in the movie.  The sensibility of the movie is not timely but the style in which it is portraited is dated which makes it just okay.  If it wasn't for Jack the movie would not be a classic.
1 ||| Unlike fine wine, Easy Rider has not aged well. This drug-fueled 1969 effort was hugely disappointing, which is saying something, given my well-known appreciation for New Hollywood cinema. Fonda and Hopper are weak sauce as leads. I was reminded of James Taylor and Dennis Wilson from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Two-Lane-Blacktop/dp/B00001ODI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Two Lane Blacktop</a>, but at least they were singers, not actors.

0 ||| The American Film Institute rated this movie #88 of the 100 best movies of all time.  While I tend to agree with the institute on their picks, I believe the Institute was likely stoned when they rated this film.  I understand the concept of the film: disillusioned anti-establishment pothead youths dropping out to find true freedom and true expression, but the filmatic means used to reach this end go absolutely nowhere.  The director, Dennis Hopper, (also a costar in this monument to the sixties), loads at least a third of the film with mostly meaningless, boring footage of the two cyclists touring through the American west using drug-culture inspired music from the 60's as the soundtrack. Honestly, I could have filmed better footage through my childhood super-8 camera. And with perhaps the exception of one or two songs (Born to Be Wild), the music is dreadfully dated, the lyrics incomprehensible, and incredibly boring.  It seems Peter Fonda's main role is to look cool, and he does this quite well, but he does little else in the entire film. His emotional range does not register on the Richter scale.  Dennis Hopper's character is one-dimensional as well - we know all about him in the first 15 minutes of the film.  Only Jack Nicholson's character lends any acting credence to the film.  Nicholson shines as the lawyer who seeks the freedom to throw off society's restraints, but even Nicholson cannot save this sinking ship.  There is a climatic scene at the end of the film when the duo reach New Orleans and celebrate Mardi Gras. They have a LSD drug trip and the camera tries to capture the "trip" experience.  Again, the sequence is poorly filmed, poorly edited, and is far too long.  The photographic special effects used are hopelessly antiquated and I am sure high school film students of today could surpass this effort.  As I compare this film to the great classics: Gone With the Wind, The Graduate, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, To Kill a Mockingbird, Easy Rider truly has no wheels to ride on.  It is not a film for the ages, on the contrary, it is a film for 1969, and it belongs buried in the failed American era that was the sixties.  kone
2 ||| I saw the play for this and it was great! The movie was a disappointment for me. The story line was not as touching as it should have been. It was not believable.
2 ||| A dated movie from the late sixties. The acting was poor and not well written as well as produce. Save your money.
2 ||| 'Easy Rider' tells of two bikers (Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper) traveling through the Southwest and South set in the 1960s. Hippies and drug use are explored, as well as the general antagonism towards 'long-hairs.' Fonda dresses in a leather jacket with an American flag on the back, while Hopper wears Native American-style buckskin pants and shirts. Fonda is appreciative of others, while Hopper is often hostile and leery of outsiders. Money is provided from the sale of cocaine from Mexico in L.A.  The two are given some LSD after leaving a commune, and told to share it with 'the right people.' Jokingly riding within a small-town parade, the two are arrested and meet ACLU lawyer/local drunk Jack Nicholson who helps get them out of jail. Later the trio are beaten at night by locals; Nicholson is killed and the other two suffer minor injuries. The two then make it to Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and later Fonda realizes their 'freedom' isn't that rewarding.  The movie ends when two other rednecks spot them, decide to 'scare the hell out of them' with a shotgun, and end up killing both after Hopper gives the one the finger.  Overall, the dialogue is minimal, and the acting even worse - except for Nicholson. On the one hand, the movie was totally boring and centers around lifestyles I dislike. On the other hand, it does a fair job of depicting the counter-culture lifestyle. Regardless, Peter Fonda looks as much like a motorcyclist as I look like Mr. T.
2 ||| What kind of capitalist plot is that?  Guess I'll wait for it to come around to pay-cable again! BTW, the scene where they can't get a room at a motel?  It's not because they were long-haired hippy bikers, but because they were F**ING rude!
2 ||| I remember being blown away by this movie when it first came out in 1969. Just the bikers in the final scene, especially, left me breathless. I remember leaving the theater feeling depressed because the conflict between the hippy bikers and the rednecks who finally shoot them dead seemed so emblematic of the bigger divide in society then between the straights and the hippies. Of course, I was only 16 then. What did I know? Today, this film plays a little differently. You have to look at it in its own context. Yes, the dialogue is ridiculous. And there is really no plot, to speak of. The soundtrack, which was very cool and original in its day, has, of course, been superceeded many times over by newer films that make more sophisticated use of music. The New Orleans cemetery scene is the weakest section. It was shot out of context from the rest of the film, and was something done first as a way for the filmmakers to try to get some money to make this movie. Dennis Hopper was a Hollywood pariah at the time. No one wanted to work with him because of his crazed drugging and drinking. Jack Nicholson was largely unknown, then a star of many obscure B-movies. Peter Fonda was the big man then, ironic because today he is the most forgotten of the three, never having made much in the way of other hit movies. See this as a piece of history, and maybe even entertainment, if you are nostalgic for the 60s.
0 ||| One of the worst movies I have ever seen. This film has virtually no story just some guys ride motorcycles and then get shot. If you like movies with completley irrelavent scenes that are inconsequential, this a movie for you.
0 ||| Overrated,boring and long,It stars Two Pseudo-Commie And Poseur Actors:Fonda and Nicholson(Hopper is good though). The movie does not represent True Bikers. Bikers Are not Hippies,They Are Tough,they were TRUE Counter-Culture,Realists And Reactionary like myself. Sure There are bad apples and racists, but it isn't liberal fascist like most hippies. The best Biker Film is Hells Angels 69' and it actually has them in it!
1 ||| Two hippies, Wyatt and Billy, drive cross country on their motorcycles in order to blow a lot of money at Mardi gras.  In the process they meet a slew of strange yet vital characters in their eventual understanding of their own existence.  The problem I have with `Easy Rider' is that it doesn't go anywhere for nearly half the film.  I usually adore this freelance style of filmmaking, but `Easy Rider' does not sit well with me at all.  In fact, the film is one gigantic fail for me until Jack Nicholson enters the story.  His performance is outstanding, but I'll get to that in a minute.  The film seems to just hang there, serving as a longwinded music video for some great classic rock tunes and some stunning (yet unrefined) cinematography.  The `profound' statement that this film is trying to make gets lost along the way, only unveiling itself in small doses (like when Nicholson gets preachy in a sleeping bag).  `Easy Rider' is sort of boring.  Dennis Hooper's direction can be distracting at times (the way he splices his scenes together is creative yet unnecessary) and the tonal shift of his film towards the end is rather questionable.  In fact, the whole Mardi gras sequence (that psychedelic cemetery trip scene) is staggeringly brilliant yet completely mind-numbing in that it is so out of place it becomes a deterrent to the film, not an aid.  The eventual ending, while wholly prolific and steeped in profound insight, is more of a head-scratcher than anything else.  I think that is my biggest complaint with the films second half (which is far better than the droned out first half).  It is entirely inconsistent and winds up lacking any cohesive feeling.  But, there is always Jack Nicholson.  His performance is one of the best supporting performances of all time.  It is slick with wit, intelligence, bravado and profound sentiment.  He ties together a lot of loose ends about the `meaning' here, without ever feeling out of place or forced.  His charisma is in tact and his humor is just what this film needed.  I won't demean him by using the phrase `comic relief', but I will say that he spices up a film in dire need of some `spice'.  Jack playing Jack to perfection.  In the end, I have to say that I am NOT impressed with this one.  I was really excited about seeing this, but halfway through I was aching to turn it off.  The only reason I watched it through to completion was the fact that I wanted to see what Nicholson did here, and I'm glad I witnessed that performance.  So, if you are a fan of Jack then see this, for it is one of his best turns (he should have won the Oscar for this), but the film as a whole is not only outdated but uninspired, clumsy and boring.  This is the definition of a missed opportunity.
2 ||| Sitting in a USC screening room with Peter Fonda, I remember seeing this iconic film before it was released.  At the time, I was dealing with my application for Conscientious Objector status with the draft board.  I was also being hassled by the FBI as an outspoken critic of the Viet Nam war.  The movie poster of Fonda as Captain America with a flag-embossed jacket riding on a big bike with the caption "A man went looking for American and couldn't find it anywhere" resonated with me.  SPOILER ALERT: And at the end, when the redneck in the pickup with the bulging tumor shoots "Billy" and "Wyatt (Fonda and Dennis Hopper)" I was incensed.  I felt I was the victim! This was the same world I was in.  The same prejudice.  The same hate.  Reel life was real life. END SPOILER ALERT.  This film was the first big "youth movie" that perfectly targeted its already alienated audience.  It was a bulls-eye.  For me, it was a brave movie because I knew that the creative team of writer Terry Southern, director Dennis Hopper, actors Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda truly believed what they put on the screen.  This movie empowered me.  I realized I was not alone in how I saw the world, the war and America.  As a film student, I was not just interested in film as propaganda, but also in how the film was shot.  I knew it was shot for cheap - less than $500K.  (Recently, I ran into Fonda and he told me the actual cost was $250,000!)  I liked ow the movie broke some cinematic rules, like the law of "consistent screen direction" by having the bikes go in all directions.  There was the innovative use of music I actually listened too.  Wow, the Electric Prunes!  How did they know?  I wondered if the dope they smoked on screen was real and I asked Fonda.  He smiled and said, "Of course."  I liked that.  I liked the stoned "Freedom" speech from Jack Nicholson.  I believed what Jack said.  Those were my words too!  This movie made Jack Nicholson a star, and with the perfect audience that identified with him from the start.  I still love the joyful, free, wide-angle moving shots of the bikes on the open road with Steppenwolf's "Born to be Wild" pulsating on the soundtrack.  "Get your motor running..."  Oh yeah.  Watching the movie today with the hindsight of alleged maturity(?), I now see an amateurish film.  Indulgent and sloppy.  Silly in places.  But the core question of What Is America? rings truer than ever.  Look for ward-of-the-state, convicted murderer and former record producer Phil Spector as a dope dealer in the opening scenes.  (R, widescreen, 95 minutes)
0 ||| Two men on motorcycles stop at a bar in a rural area. They test the powder they are buying. [No arms for security?] Back in the States they resell the powder to a very rich man. They hide their money and start on a long journey. No concern about time? There is no room at the inn for them. They stop to fix a flat, and are fed at a farm. Then the trip continues. When will they get to the Mardi Gras? "Porky Pig"? They arrive at a settlement. [How successful will they be?] Do they dine on bread and beans? Do the inmates run this asylum?  There is a parade in the next town. Do they have a permit? They meet a local character in the jail. Will he go to the Mardi Gras? Is there another society that is highly evolved? Is this just pretentious babbling to pad out the movie? They stop at a small town. People make comments, and they leave. Will somebody come after them? They arrive at that house of blue light. Then they go to the Mardi Gras to see even stranger sights. We see a New Orleans cemetery (people are buried in vaults). The picture drags on as they pass around a bottle. The scenes suggest intoxication. They leave the next morning. "We blew it." Then there is an end to their journey due to an accidental meeting with a pick-up truck. [Do you find this a credible ending?]  This film was a popular success due to its unusual story and the many songs, which masked a poor story. Today it is not worth watching. Could it be called "The Days of the Living Dead"?
2 ||| This is certainly the best independent film ever made and is also one of the best films ever.  This film succeeds in documenting the 60s counter-culture a.k.a. hippy generation very well and explores even deeper issues in addressing questions such as what is freedom and does it really exist in the "land of the free and the home of the brave?"  Fonda and Hopper play a couple of bikers who ironically in trying to live a free life become hated by the mainstream who fear what this freedom represents.  This eventually results in their persecution and destruction.  I really enjoyed all the symbolism that inundates throughout the film from the insertion of the money into the gas tank painted with the Stars and Stripes symbolising how drug money obtained from drug pushing is effectively screwing the nation for example to the murderous scenes at the end symbolising the hypocrisy of a nation that espouses freedom that kills the very citizens that strive to practice it in its purest form.  Jack Nicholson is excellent here as the drunken lawyer who is sympathetic to the bikers at the ultimate personal cost although the entire cast I thought was very good.  This film also must contain what must be one of the best ever movie soundtracks which has been very well remastered into Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound quality.  The only unfortunate thing about this dvd version though is the poor picture quality which is full of imperfections such as white spots throughout.  Here's hoping the future Blu-ray release will address this issue.  Otherwise, this is an excellent film that attempts to hide nothing and to fully show life in a certain period of the 60s warts and all.  No film buff's dvd library should be without this title but wait for a properly restored version perhaps on Blu-ray to surface and give this version a miss.  Inspired film-making that rewards repeated viewing.  Updated 29 May 2011:  As Amazon will not allow me to review this separately the Blu-Ray version of this film is a little of a mixed bag as both the picture and sound qualities although an improvement over the dvd version are only slightly so.  As this was a low budget affair I suspect the 16 mm film can only look so much better even on 1080p without a proper restoration which hasn't been done here.  Still, if you haven't already got this film then this blu-ray version is the best there is to date but if you already have the dvd, it's tough to justify the double dip.  Maybe you will want to wait to see if a proper full-scale restoration is done on the picture quality for every frame and if they will provide a proper DTS HD MA 5.1 surround option as well as the Dolby True HD and PCM Surround options for some reason are not much better than the dvd version.
0 ||| Jack Nicholson and the great soundtrack are really the only interesting or entertaining aspects of this film. I found myself fighting the urge to sleep, which was especially annoying after reading over and over again for years about what a classic, epochal movie ER was. If you want excitement, great story and script, great acting danger and an even better soundtrack from the same era, go for Performance or Get Carter. Avoid this snore.
2 ||| Ok so in 35 years there is still no director's cut? I've heard that this version we all know and love of easy rider is only about 40% of what was the original director's cut. If someone is going to put out a special edition, then supposing we finally see a second disk with the 3 or so hours of deleted scenes? And I mean- a director's cut movie, not just a bunch of isolated deleted scenes. Also, if you're going to add bonus soundtrack items, how about including the Hendrix tune from the movie, which I think is about the only one i remember from the movie that is not in the original movie soundtrack lp. But.. besides me wanting to know what the other 3 hours was like, this movie is all time classic independent american cinema and highly recommended to anyone over 18. It has great performances by many folks down to the louisiana locals who were used to make the movie more authentic. The trip scene was bizare for its time and arguably even for today, but very relatable, if you are 'experienced'. The scenery is absolutely stunning (watch it in WIDEscreen). And it's a great look at a country polarized by cultures and an unpopular war (sound familiar?) Buy the movie but save on the 'extras' till the 'extras' means the whole 4+ hours movie.
1 ||| This is one of those movies that is on the AFI's "Top 100 films of all time" list. In my opinion that list is bogus. Only about a quarter of the films on that list deserve to be there. I don't think Easy Rider is anywhere close to one of the top 100 films of all time. Easy Rider seems fairly pointless. Billy(Dennis Hopper) and Wyatt (Peter Fonda) drive around on their choppers, pick up a hippie, and drive around some more. That sums up the first half of the film. Don't get me wrong, it isn't exactly boring, but it isn't exactly a great story either. To be honest this movie doesn't really have a story.  Dennis Hopper directed this film and the word is that he was completely stoned out of his mind. I can believe that. There is a scene at the end where the Billy and Wyatt drop some acid and go on a little trip with two hookers in a cemetary. To me it seems pretty easy to shoot an acid trip. Just shoot random stuff, cut it together randomly and voila! You have your scene. Or better yet, give the camera to a monkey. The out of focus shots and frenetic animal jerkiness will only add to the overall aesthetic of the scene. Its ok for the first 20 seconds, but anything longer than that gets monotonous.  Jack Nicholson is amazing as usual. He is so good, so convincing, and has such presence that he completely steals every scene that he is in. The other actors are good too in their own ways; Dennis Hopper made me laugh several times, but then again watching stoned guys do stupid things will usually make you laugh anyway.  The cinematography is very good. Lszl Kovcs does good work and he captures the scenery very well. God knows there is plenty of time for that during the course of the movie. There is a little incongruity towards the end when they try to match 16mm footage with the rest of the 35mm film, but other than that the picture is good. There are some weird things done with the editing that I didn't really understand or care for. There is a reoccuring theme of stuttering images before cutting to a new scene. It kind of seems like a film student experiment that was left in the film accidently.  I'll bet this movie was great back in the days of hippies and woodstock, but now it just comes off flat. It does give some insight into that time period, but there are many other better films that can do the same thing and tell you a story at the same time.  My rating: 2 of 5
2 ||| I was 11 years old when this came out. So of course I heard a lot about it but didn't see this movie. So when I had a chance to watch it I decided to see what the fuss was about. Well, considering the times it was made, it was a radical departure from the norm. Nudity, pot smoking and perhaps other no-nos of that period.  The story is kinda boring. Two motorcycle enthusiasts take a trip to New Orleans to go to Mardi Gras. There is tragedy because of prejudice and so there is a sad quality to this film. Still, it's not a great movie just ahead of it's time...maybe. Plus it introduced the great actor Jack Nicholson.
0 ||| Well, it may have been representative of its day, but as of 12/27/05, it's grown pretty tedious.  It has one thing to say, that could be said in about 10 minutes, but it spreads the "message" out over way too long. The ending is truly shocking, and somewhat redeems the tedium of the earlier parts of the film that tend to drag, drag, drag.  Jack Nicholson is, of course, the bright spot in the film, but he's in waaaaay to little of it.
1 ||| I can't help, but ask that question. I really wasn't that impressed with this movie. I feel that it really didn't explain what the 60's were all about. I feel that what it did was tell everyone "Party, and you'll be alright." It just didn't gel together enough for me as I feel that the 60's may have been just a complete waste of time. I know one scene that really gripped me was when the main characters go to this hippie commune, and we see a guy who's is obviously stoned out of his mind holding a little baby who's crying, and while it makes the guy disturbed he doesn't do anything about it; Let's face it to me what the father of that baby was wanting was to have someone take that baby away from him so he can get back to the free sex, and the drugs. You see I feel that the movie would've sold me better if it was more geared towards the values the people were trying to hold to back then. I know that the decade was about equality, and world peace, and how everybody wanted them so bad, but the movie looks more on the selfish side of the hippies. With the main characters scoring alot of money from a drug buy, and the carefree style of just traveling along the country without a care in the world. The only character I feel was worth something was played by Jack Nicholson. A lawyer who seemed so dissilousioned with the way things were that he joins Hopper and Fonda for awhile on the trip. I know that during this decade everyone was wondering what's going on? Was the way our parents raised us, and the values they tried to instill in us wrong? This is understandable considering everybody was starting to think more broader. I can't say if it was because of the drugs, or not that caused everyone to start challenging the values of thier parents, but that's where the movie should've been centered. I just can't help, but feel that Fonda's character was right "We Blew It." I know that's what happened with this movie here. A somewhat decent soundtrack, but it's not the masterpiece that everyone feels that it is. I know that this is tough stuff, but I've kept silent about it for 16 years, and it was time to release my feelings on this movie. I feel that it revealed to me that this hippie culture is one of self-indulgence, and escaping responsibilities. It's not about peace, or love. Now there is no resolution as the former hippies have gone on to represent the people they hated, and they've developed a callous attitude that the people they hated had, so what are we to believe? Are we to accept this on blind faith? Well some people may say yes as once again the movie left me feeling with one of the songs from the Blind Faith album "Do What You Like".
0 ||| This is another work of liberal propoganda from the sixtys  designed to encourage children to turn on their country,  drop out and use drugs.  The story (if you can call it that) has two drug dealers riding  motorcycles across the american west.  They are smuggling drugs  the whole way.  Its less a movie than a music video because  nobody in the film can really act.  Endless motocycle panoramas  set to music followed by a seemingly endless trip-out scene  where our boys play around in a graveyard with whores and  mock the idea of religion.  The film is full of the liberal paranoid view of America.  That  Americans who work, have families, have jobs, are clean and  don't do drugs sit around all day plotting how to kill everyone  else.  Its always news to them, but real Americans are far too  busy working and living their lives to care much about what  a bunch of deadbeats are up to.  Peter Fonda spends the whole film in love with himself.  I can  imagine after every take him pulling out a mirror and grooming  himself.  The other guy (Hopper) is a dirtball.  He must have  been out of it nearly the whole time because they go out of their  way to reduce his lines down to nothing.  Nicholson is the only  person in the movie who can half-way act, and at best he gives  a B-grade supporing character actor performance.  And by hippie-liberal logic, since Nicolson is the only actor  here, he gets the least screen time and gets killed off real  quick.  As is always the case under socialism, the punishment  for showing that your better than other people is severe.  At the end of the film, our druggie heros get shot to death  out on the road by regular america for no reason.  The day  before they get shot, Fonda tells the dirty guy "we blew it"  forshadowing that they were going to be punished and killed.  By liberal logic, Hopper and Fonda blew it (and brought death  on themselves) because as noble as liberals consider drug  smuggling, it also could be considered work.  Work for  these kind of guys is the ultimate crime against nature.  This film and its two dirtballs turn the concept of freedom  around.  Freedom was never about freedom from work or freedom  to use lots of drugs.  Freedom is about opportunity, not  being a parasite.
2 ||| Finally got around to seeing this... Meh. It was okay. Considering the buzz from female friends and family members, I was expecting more. It holds up well as a film from the eighties, but not entirely for me.
2 ||| "Easy Rider" is the 60s counter-culture classic that seems to wreak slightly of formaldehyde today. It stars Peter Fonda (Wyatt) and Dennis Hopper (Bill) as a pair of drugged out loners who trade a formidable amount of cocaine to `Connection' (Phil Specter) for a sizable amount of cash. Unfortunately, the best that either Wyatt or Bill can think of doing with their new found wealth is to mount a pair of truly sweet cycles and roam the countryside - looking for trouble and, ultimately finding more than they bargained for.  Along the way they enter into an on again off again tempestuous relationship with loose canon George Hanson (Jack Nicholson). Together the boys go through a heap of money, a string of hookers and more than a few ounces of psychedelic trippin'. Nothing seems to help cleanse these reprobates of their rebel without a clue - little boys lost - syndrome. Fueled by a soundtrack that features Steppenwolf's classic "Born to Be Wild," "Easy Rider" is anything but, and perhaps, the closest realization of the decade's hippy counterculture ever put on film. That it today seems quaint in its hostility toward authority only serves to reflect just how lost contemporary film culture is.  Previously, "Easy Rider" had been made available through Columbia Tristar in a moderately pleasing DVD transfer. If you're thinking of upgrading to this new 35th Anniversary edition for a better print of the film don't bother. This is the exact same transfer and extras previously made available. The only pluses to this edition are an extra CD of the film's soundtrack and a nicely put together pocket book on the making of the film. But the DVD quality remains the same. As for the quality of the transfer - beginning as it does with several long shots of the boys on their bikes, there is a remarkable amount of resolution to be had in the image. Fine details are nicely realized for the most part and colors, while slightly dated, exhibit a fairly accurate level of contrast and balance. Unfortunately, roughly mid-way through this transfer some strange digital happenings begin to occur, beginning with the flashback sequence in which Wyatt and Bill pick up a pair of hookers. Designed to reflect to an audience that the sequence is going on in the mind of the boys, its exceptionally grainy and slightly out of focus with a bleached out color scheme that is unflattering to say the least. On top of the inherent grain in the print we get an exceptional amount of digital grit which generally makes for a very harsh looking image. Also, the print quality after the flashback - which until its insertion had been moderately pleasing to very nicely done - is increasingly riddled with age related artifacts and grain which degrades the final third of the film's image quality. I really am unable to account for the reason this occurs but it does and is distracting. The audio is 5.1 and, as expected, dated. Dialogue is never natural sounding, obviously manufactured post production studio recordings that are tinny at best. The one kick that the audio gets is in its throbbing rock score that jumps to life with an explosive bass and vibrating treble.
2 ||| The specificiations listed say there's the soundtrack and this 80 page booklet. How poor. Check out the british Edition to come. The REgion 2 edition will have great packaging, the same booklet, but instead of just the soundtrack, it will include a new master of the film and the documentary "easy riders, raging bulls", which is also avaible as a paperback novel best seller by Biskind.   so I still hope this version will be updated with that documentary in a great package, otherwise we true fans just have to pick the British DVD
2 ||| I watched this movie again last night after not having seen it for about 25 years.  I had almost completely forgotten the plot, except for the ending.  I did not grow up here, but I have lived in the deep south all of my adult life, and as usual the actors in this film have the stereotypical phony Southern "accents" -- even Dolly Parton has been too long in Tinseltown.  And even here the accents change somewhat (NC being different from GA, which is again different from an LA parish).  I understand that the rest of America cannot hear it, but native southerners pick right up on the forced sound of the actors.  The other thing that bothered me this go-round was the obvious change of seasons in the story (Easter, Halloween, Christmas, and back to Easter over several years) -- all while the native foliage is in the full bloom of summer.  We do have the four distinct seasons here, and our deciduous trees all turn colors and are then bare by late Fall every year.  However, I don't remember one outdoor scene where the trees were anything but fully green.  It gives the impression to the viewer that the entire movie was shot start-to-finish in about eight weeks.  The IMdB website of this film lists at least 34 shots where there was some flub or mis-continuity, but never mentions the obvious lack of outdoor seasons.  Other than that, a sad and funny film, with a wonderful title theme from Georges Delerue.
2 ||| As good as Easy Rider is, it is not the type of movie that is going to pull in younger crowds.. The message of peacefulness and community with its underlying criticism of those who take this concept to brain-dead stages is one that stands the test of time. Unfortunately, the mechanics of the movie itself simply do not. Nicholson, Hopper and Fonda all give great performances. However, this movie is always going to appeal more to the peace and flower power crowd than the [chemical] genre crowd.. For the latter, this movie simply cannot compete with Trainspotting, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, etc..
2 ||| I did not love this movie to death but did not dislike it intently either.  Sort of middle of the road.  I actually like Jack Nicolson's character.  Easily the least sleazy between him, Fonda, and Hopper ... Truthfully the story line is quite annoying. The ... haze isn't really my style but I wanted to see what all the hype was about.  Liked the scenery of the guys riding through America.  The film sets a mood for the 60's biker ... culture and I can relate to what its trying to say. People who grew up in the sixties or who can related to the ... counterculture will like this film.  Nonetheless, I cannot agree that Easy Rider is the universal all time classic that it is reverred as by all these film societies.
1 ||| "Easy Rider" (1969) "A classic...a great film for its day...everyone is sure to love it", those were the comments I had been hearing about Easy Rider before I rented it. I expected this movie to be great because it was called a counterculture classic and topped many people's lists of the best film of the 1960's. In my opinion, Easy Rider is a case of don't believe everything you read. Sure, the movie has its good points. The music is fantastic. The songs are all very memorable and suit the road theme, styles of the film and the time in which it is set very well. Many of the songs of the movie have become classics since the films release. Easy Rider is also shot gorgeously, with heaps of great sunset shots and motorcycle journeys. The performances in the movie are also very good. Jack Nicholson is the stand out as the innocent comic relief Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda meet when they go to jail. Nicholson deserved another Oscar for this role! Hopper clearly put a lot of effort into the film being a writer, director and lead actor, but his continuous "man's" and hippie references annoyed the heck out of me, as did his monologues about what he "sees" after he takes drugs. Peter Fonda was hailed as the leading actor of the movie but he really doesn't say that much and he has very little facial expression. His acting definitely got better. There was also way too many drugs in this movie. In the film, this is basically the story: these 2 guys take drugs, encounter people, take drugs, make the people they encounter take drugs, take some drugs, sleep, take a couple more drugs, have sex, and then take drugs. And apparently this story is all about "freedom" according to Dennis Hopper. Yeah right. Also, Easy Rider doesn't present any ideas why or why not the characters should be doing this. Why are they doing it in the first place? Is taking drugs a way to make people free and express freedom? No. I found the use of drugs both pointless and excruciatingly unrealistic in this film. So, the movie does have its good points - the cinematography, bikes and Jack Nicholson - but not enough to overcome the whole pointlessness of the entire production. This is one big disappointment for me, and I can't believe such a film that was hailed as a "classic" could be so banal and stupid. MY GRADE: C-
2 ||| I think this is a good movie for ladies.  It has a lot of different emotions in it...sad, happy, funny, etc.
0 ||| A somewhat interesting movie due to the time period this movie was filmed. Basically, this movie was nothing special and pretty much like a million other movies out there. The movie is totally overrated mostly due to the cast, Fonda, Hopper, and Jack Nicolas.
2 ||| I am 25 years old right now, and the first time I saw this movie, I had no clue what they were trying to get across. Now I am fascinated by it, and its controvery is far more apparent to me. My best recomendation to anyone who is going to see this for the first time and did not live in the 60s is to learn more about the time period first. That way, when you see Henry Fonda stuffing money into his gas tank so he can buy drugs on his road trip, you will realize that the mainstream reaction was "Oh my lord, how can someone do such a thing, like actually plan out that they know that they will want drugs in the near future." And there is even more to that shot besides what I have tried to articulate. So there is no sure fire way to explain this movie to anyone too young to remember when it first came out. However, if one makes the effort (and not an extreme one is needed) the times and feelings of the 60s can become intelligible. I can honestly say that now being able to watch this movie and understand it is a most rewarding experience for me, so all I can say is I hope it can be for others like myself.
2 ||| Easy Rider is a counterculture touchstone.  It also was a trailblazer in the independent film market.  There had other hippie movies before, but they were mostly bad films about drug use.  Easy Rider tells the story of two hippies, played by Dennis Hopper & Peter Fonda, who motorcycle across the country from California to New Orleans for Mardi Gras.  They had just made a big drug score and are using that money for the trip.  Along the way, they stay at a commune in the desert, get caught up in a dispute in a small town and of course take alot of drugs.  There is a scene in a New Orleans graveyard that visualizes an acid trip.  Jack Nicholson shows up as a drunk who is constantly being jailed.  He rides along with Mr. Hopper & Mr. Fonda and meets an untimely death. The role garnered Mr. Nicholson an Oscar nomination and catapulted him to stardom.  The film is visually pretty and well shot and they make great use of rock songs as no other movie had beforehand. The film was also a commentary by hippies about hippies.  It is supposed to show that hippies are just peace loving people who embody the freedom America is supposed to give people.  They are unfairly persecuted by small-minded people who judge them by the length of their hair.  At the time, this was all groundbreaking stuff.  The problem is that the film hasn't aged well in the 30 years since it's release.  It is still cemented back in 1969 and now is just a relic from that time.  The film's power should be more judged for the doors it opened up for other maverick film makers like Martin Scorcese, Peter Bogdanovich and other later ones like Quentin Tarantino and Spike Lee.  Before Easy Rider, you had to play within the system.  After it became a huge success, you could go underground and get daring pictures released.
2 ||| "Easy Rider" is one of those movies that took me forever to see  and when I finally did I was dissapointed somewhat.  True, it launched the  careers of Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and Jack Nicholson.  It featured  some of the best rock music of the time in the soundtrack. The  cinematography is wonderful as well.  So what's the problem?  Well for one  thing the characters are not developed well at all.  By the film's end I  knew little more about them than I did when I started.  It was also fairly  boring too.  It did not move fast at all.  But it is worth a watch if you  want to see some great actors before they hit their prime.  And who can  argue with the famous credit sequence when Fonda and Hopper are riding  their bikes listening to "Born To Be Wild"?  It's good for a  viewing or two.  But don't expect anything magnificent.
0 ||| From the bizarre editing to the lame dialogue, from the horrible sound track (before my time!) to the glorification of drug use--of which I definitely do not approve--I can easily say that "Easy Rider" is  among the five WORST films I have ever seen in my life!  The American  Film Institute includes this bomb in its list of 100 greatest American  films, so I thought I'd check it out.  This film is so bad that I can't  even think of four other films to insult by including them in the same  list.  Sad to say, but by the end of the film, I was actually rooting for  the rednecks--and wasn't disappointed!
1 ||| Easy Rider is a legendary movie. This ofcourse is due to its cultural and box office impact rather then the quality of the film itself. Today the film is merely a curio-item, but as a film, it just doesn't work. Witness  for example the ludicrous dialogue, when a farmer invites Fonda and Hopper  to eat with his family, there is a close-up of Fonda's face as he says  "Its great thing for a man to live off the land, you should be  proud." Please, this sounds like a public service commercial for some  farmers union. Hopper as a director has this highly annoying gimmick of  falshing frames of the next scene twice before actually moving onto it, and  he doesn't do it once but throughout the film. Now I'm aware that this  gimmickry might have been revolutionary back in the sixties, but now it  only breaks the flow of a film that is already hard to sit through. The  movie consists of endless shots of Fonda and Hopper on their bike, and not  much else, but it does however recieve a major jolt with Jack Nicholson's  arrival, he briefly awakens this movie out of its slumber. Unfortunatly  he's not on for long, and we're back to Fonda and Hopper on bikes. The  movie then ends in an extended acid trip which despite being completely  pointless is far more entertaining then the rest of this tepid film. Watch  this if you're a serious film buff and want to know what the hoopla is  about, but once you've gotten through it once, I doubt you'll have it in  you to sit through it again.
0 ||| This poorly made, boring flick is nothing if not profoundly patriarchal. The main story line revolves around a young woman who is willing to risk her life and die in order to produce a baby. Because the central goal of a woman's life is to make babies. Unless you can fulfill this goal, you are incomplete. So of course, the only reasonable thing to do is for a woman literally to kill herself in an attempt to produce a baby.  There are many other female characters who are mainly dedicated to endless hen-like clucking around the protagonist's attempts to have a baby, as well as interminable conversations about hair-styles, weddings, husbands, etc. In Steel Magnolias, we see women of all generations inhabiting a world of their own. It's a world of babies, beauty, and homemaking. It's a world of things that the patriarchal societies always mark as exclusively female. Men are supposed to be detached from these "womanly" interests and concerns, while women have no interest in the pursuits of men. The view of genders as profoundly divided by an unbridgeable chasm of difference is patriarchal.  Why this film has been hailed as a feminist classic and has become a perennial staple of "Feminist Film" courses is beyond me.
2 ||| I'll never understand the male stereotype that says you cannot admit to liking anything that doesn't involve bloodshed, sports or nudity.  Sure, as a guy I can understand why those three things are appealing to my gender (although I am far from a sports fan) but I have never been one to hide my deeper feelings or emotions.  I cry whenever I want to; I have deep and meaningful conversations with my male friends and I definitely watch whatever it is that I want to regardless of the intended fan base.  I say this, not because I think that this is a particularly good movie but because this seems to be a popular movie that men feel unabashedly ashamed in either watching or enjoying or, god forbid, crying at.  The film tells the story of a group of women who frequent the same hair salon and become a central part of each others lives over the years.  There is M'Lynn, the kind hearted mother who only wants what is best for her daughter Shelby, who just so happens to be a serious diabetic.  There is Truvy, who owns the salon, and Annelle, her new employee with a background no one is too sure about.  There is the loudmouthed Ouiser and her loyal friend Clairee.  Together they make for one lively bunch.  The film mostly focuses on M'Lynn and Shelby as they struggle to come to terms with Shelby's growing independence.  Shelby wants to get married and have children, but the doctors have warned her that childbirth will not be a smart move for someone in her condition.  M'Lynn wants to allow her daughter to live her own life, but she also is the mother and mothers always know what is best for their children; right?  The film is tragically clich&eacute;d, which probably adds to the memorable factor, since we've seen it all before, but it takes away from the originality and my personal overall appreciation of the film.  It's also very heavy handed, and it's not always smooth about it either.  The acting is a bit spotty, sometimes so over the top it's annoying and other times so grounded in itself that it is stunningly superb.  Let's look at the two opposite ends of the spectrum; Shirley MacLaine and Sally Field.  Two of my favorite actresses of all time spar off and only one is the victor; Field.  Sally Field delivers what may be her finest performance ever, delving deep into the maternal spectrum of this woman's very being.  M'Lynn aches to see her daughter live a full life, but she cannot look past the fact that a full life may very well kill her.  It's heartbreaking to say the least.  Shirley MacLaine, who may even be a better actress as a whole, is ridiculously overacting throughout this film.  Her mannerisms are all over the place and her characters comedic timing borders on annoying.  It's shameful, which is sad, because I love her.  Olympia Dukakis is stunning here, Dolly Parton is fun and Daryl Hannah is effectively nave, even if neither do a whole lot to be remembered for.  Julia Roberts was nominated for an Oscar for her performance, and was the favorite to win (although she lost) but her performance is decent at best, never really investing itself as deeply as Field's.  She does a fine job, but nothing spectacular.  So, did this movie make me cry?  Yes, it did, and I am not ashamed to say that.  The ending is such a heartbreaker, and Field is so convincing in her tragic portrayal that anyone who doesn't cry is made of stone, really.  Is the movie really as amazing as many make it out to be?  No, not really.  It works to an extent and sports a beautiful performance but its own clich&eacute;s and spotty collective ensemble tear it down a few notches and keep it from being the classic many want it to be.  See it for Field, for she is heaven-sent, but don't expect too much from the film as a whole.
1 ||| In 2005, we took a weekend trip from Baton Rouge, LA to Natchitoches, LA, where fifteen years earlier the filming of Steel Magnolias in 1989 remains about the biggest thing that ever happened. Having never seen the movie, we rented it as soon as we got back home. Everyone had a reason for watching it in two segments--mine was my sense that this was one of the "cutest" movies I'd ever seen, and I'd had quite enough "cute" lately, especially after sitting through Will Smith in "Hitch". The accents and the caricatures of the characters were all so thick that it reminded me of The Beverly Hillbillies, though more embarrassing than funny. One "Hillbillies-like" moment that pretty funny was the few non-female characters' effort to shoot some "crows" out of a tree so that they won't "**** all over the reception". Their creative use of a crossbow is a classic.  Sad to say there isn't much else classic in a story that is at the same time saccharine and maudlin. There was also some choppiness between scenes (as the movie was adapted from a play that never left the beauty shop). I can think of two scenes in particular--one where the town-big wig Clairee (played by the noted-Southern belle Olympia Dukasis) buys the local radio station so that she can do the color commentary on the local football games (the scene features the same guy filmed bare from the back waist-and-lower view as he walks in front camera in the locker room three times.) In another scene, the Darryl Hannah (hard to recognize) committed Christian character argues with her boyfriend over his repeated taking of the Lord's name in vain. Neither scene has any impact on the rest of the story.  Dolly Parton is her usual big hair, big smile, big **** self as the lead hairdresser. Shirley MacLaine has a very unsympathetic character as the Eatonton's (Julie and Sally, and family) ill-tempered neighbor. The male characters are more or less wasted, especially the estimable Sam Shepard, who spends most of the film underneath a car, or sitting lifelessly in front of a TV.  The movie improved from the seemingly endless wedding prep and wedding of the first half to the second half, which became more dramatic. Sally Field has a pretty good scene near the end, she and the story make you think a little about the motives of the main character (Julia Roberts as Shelby).  Overall, I thought that Steel Magnolias was a relatively embarrassing depiction of life in the beautiful town of Natchitoches, LA. Given that the locals seemed not to mind too much, I may be overreacting. They even showed us where the truck made an illegal left turn in the final scene.
2 ||| Some pretty big talent (Sally Field, Dolly Parton, Julia Roberts, Darryl Hannah, Shirley MaClaine) and a good story lead me to recommend this film.  Shelby (Julia Roberts)is a head-strong diabetic who, against doctor's orders, decides to get pregnant and have a child.  Based on a true story, "Steel Magnolias" concerns itself with the group of strong Southern women who become Shelby's insulated comfort zone during her time of need. Some of the aspects of the film, including dialogue references, costume design and overall set design, has pegged the movie as a product of the 80's.  That isn't to say that it's not a good film.  But it just doesn't hold up quite as well as say, "Fried Green Tomatoes". Columbia has given us a rather worn looking print of this movie.  Colors are slightly faded or off balance and there is some smearing of background details that comes from the overuse of noise reduction equipment in the DVD mastering process. No pixelization, some slight edge enhancement and a bit of fine detail shimmering also present.  The sound is amply presented but exhibits an equally dated characteristic.  The documentary that accompanies this feature is rather disappointing.  Although we learn why the film was written, there are virtually NO INTERVIEWS with principle cast members and very little in the way of background on how the film was made.  Also incl. theatrical trailer.  BOTTOM LINE: Still a good reason to stay home on a rainy night.  Just remember to bring Kleenex.
0 ||| Hey i'm a guy.  And guess what... I loved Thelma and Louise, A Leaugue of their own, The Color Purple, Somewhere in Time... and I could go on but why. I saw absolutely nothing and I do mean nothing special about this film.  I just don't get it.
0 ||| This movie really borders on absurd. The play was simple, heart-felt and centered more on the goings on in the beauty salon. This movie is so overproduced that it diminishes the story and the performances.  Sally  Field gives a credible performance. Shirley McLaine and Olympia Dukakis  play their characters like a cartoon. And Dolly Parton proves she is really  sweet but can't act her way out of a paper bag.  As for Julia  Roberts...well she has screen presence, but she just can't act. Forget this  super-size cotton candy film.
2 ||| The first time watching the movie is ok.  Not that good each time after.
0 ||| With  'Close Encounters', simply surviving the opening scenes at Roy and Ronnie Neary's home, with their psycho-children doing as they wish, with no one acting as an adult - Ronnie, presumably, solely a baby-breeder, and Roy the uncontrolled sperm - who doesn't want the script have these wretched people taken away by aliens - forever.  (Did Terri Garr ever get to portray a woman anyone could stand being around).  Top world-scientists surrounded by computers, and slide rules,  have to rip a large globe from its pedestal in order fix latitude and longitude?  Now, there's a piece of needless and embarrassing  action.  I like the concept of the film.  I like that it is mathematics, including music, that creates a universal language..  It is reasonable that, as portrayed, the government would do everything in its power to deny the arrival of extra-terrestrials, not because I believe they exist, but because governments are historically fearful of a knowledgeable public.  Even on the VHS tape of this movie, there is an interview following the movie.  Just why would there not have been air conditioning brought in to the hangar in Alabama, so that the crew and actors were not sweltering.  What was the point?  I mean, they went to India.  This is why I can't even be an extra.  I'm working.  I get fed.  I don't get exposed to conditions that could land me in the hospital.  This is all very sado-masochistic.  Very unnecessary.  Seeing Devil's Tower in real life, without a script, or special effects, has far more impact than any movie.
2 ||| Somewhat corny at times.  Does not hold up to 80's/90's flics.
0 ||| It was better than 2001 A Space Odyssey, but it still stunk.
2 ||| When I was younger this movie was amazing. The effects were mind blowing. They simply don't hold up. Sitting through this again I realized that almost nothing actually happens and the spectacle of space ships and aliens doesn't really drive much action or story, basically only some conflict with the wife. The aliens play some tones and have all the effect on the planet of a man leaving the toilet seat up.
1 ||| Only good thing was the musical conversation. The rest SUCKED and made me sad.
0 ||| Good acting, and there's some suspenseful parts that keep you on the edge of your seat, but overall I wasn't impressed. I didn't even finish watching this movie. I only watched about half of it, then turned it off because I was getting so bored. Would not recommend.
2 ||| CE3K is nice to have on Blu-Ray, whether it's the "essentials" or "anniversary" edition, but you should also keep your DVD handy. The Blu-Ray puts all three versions of the film on one disc, using "seamless branching" to automatically edit together whichever cut you choose. But the seamless branching isn't so seamless. The transitions are very obvious, with glitches in the audio. This is especially evident during the model-making scene in Roy's living room while his TV is on. The Blu-Ray picture is of course beautifully sharp, so it is worth having. I just recommend keeping your DVD edition too, so you can choose which is more important whenever you decide watch the film - a sharp picture, or smooth audio transitions. Because you can't have both!
0 ||| terrible...absolutely terrible, there are 3 disc's....the first one is the original, B.S. @ 15 min., dad shows son math problem by using a toy train set- not this one, only a train wreck....@ 30 min.,scene shifts to the desert where a ship has been found- not this one; disc 3 is the directors cut, it shows these 2 scenes but also cuts out a couple parts from the original.....had I known this, I wouldn't have bought it...don't waste your money on this one
2 ||| Did not see the old version, I was simply interested in seeing this movie since a known person that has dedicated his life to the research of Alien encounters vs fake government projects which also mimic Alien encounters to scare people...He briefly recommended the movie during one of his videos and it was a good movie that goes against the main stream idea of Alien wanting to destroy the world. I wouldn't watch it twice since only the plot was interesting to me and the story line is good but not something that will make you amazed. I would only recommend it to people interested in the whole debate about Aliens etc..I skipped through a lot of parts that were stretched out and didn't show anything really. The idea was simple and I just wanted to know what will happen in the end and what the encounter was like. Everything else was kind of dull. It wasn't this amazing story about the government vs society and secret organizations being able to find the truth for ex..etc..it was really simple and unrealistic in the way our society/government would behave (or possibly already has) if something like this happened.
2 ||| Wasen't what I espected.
1 ||| Watched this after watching Contact for the first time, and there is no contest about which one is better. The positive reviews for this movie mention "a sense of wonder an awe" a lot, Ebert included, and I just don't see it. The main character is an awful person that I didn't want to root for BEFORE he starting losing his mind, let alone after. The pacing is dreadful and the motivations of the characters and the government is poorly sketched, so it's just hard to care about what's happening on screen. Possibly worse, they kept trying to add suspense with mysteries and spooky happenings that the movie had already let the audience in on 10 minutes ago.  The only redeeming factor was some good thematic moviemaking. People struggling to communicate and have relationships with each other, giving a dim view of the almost impossible communication with another species. It's a shame those themes don't get resolved in the script and that the main character doesn't appear to change himself or the plot by the finale.  Skip it.
2 ||| While the movie plot was still a classic "good story", I was seriously unimpressed with the film's print qualty. This is billed as an HD copy,  with no obvious work done to it. Still as a Spielberg product,  it is not to be missed. Buy the Blu-ray for $10- 15....!
2 ||| Good movie for the 1970"s I always wanted to see this movie. after visiting Devils Tower in WY this summer I decided to watch it. Thanks for having it available Amazon
2 ||| As expected.  Very Nice.
0 ||| This film is boring. In 1977 these special effects with all the electronics activating themselves and the giant spaceship coming down must of been earth shattering but viewed now it is a slow, disjointed mess. I know the guy playing the Frenchman is a legendary director but having the character be French means nothing, and is especially confusing to follow. Why is a French UFO hunter investigating missing American WWII planes? What?!? It goes on from the as we transition from one drawn out scene to the next. The characters are all flat, Dreyfuss is underwhelming and after his encounter, he has visions which cause his wife and family to split. I never cared about any of the characters, they were one dimensional and stereotypical. It just goes on too long. This is a slow plodding film with no rhyme or reason that just doesn't hold up. Save yourself 2 and 1/2 hours and skip this. After Jaws, Spielberg was the it boy and they gave him carte blanche and he gave them an alien encounter movie. He did much better with E.T. but this one not so much.
2 ||| People see lights in the sky in Indiana and develop a need to draw/sculpt a mountain. A child gets abducted. Electricity is affected. Then people go to Wyoming. The last 25 percent of the movie is people standing around saying little and looking at space ships. Visually pleasing but short on explaining.
2 ||| Good classic if you like classic movies.  Otherwise it's ok.
2 ||| A little silly by today's standards.
1 ||| I remember seeing this when DRIVE IN's were still a thing.. curled up in the back of my fathers AMC EAGLE Wagon.. figured i would watch it again.. was instantly annoyed by the constant screaming of everyone in the film and the kids.  Cant believe I liked it as a kid!
0 ||| Wow - this movie has aged badly, very, very, very badly.  SS is not that great a director at all...yuck.
1 ||| I got this as a present, but I don't really like it. I know others have loved it, but I couldn't get into it.
2 ||| Good movie, but it is a bit slow towards the end. Difficult to understand for an 8 year old. Thanks
1 ||| I have never understood what people saw in this nonsense. Richard Dreyfuss portrays a complete ass who abandons his family on an idiotic whim - this is a hero? What does he accomplish? Nothing. The movie is well filmed and produced but to me it is like covering an aging hooker with makeup and pretending you have anything other than an old hooker.
2 ||| Everyone alive has seen this movie by now, so there's no point in writing yet another review.  I just wanted to say something negative about Richard Dreyfus, who in my opinion is possibly one of the worst actors - ever.  And I mean that.  He's untalented, irritating and just terrible in every role.  I can't think of one role he's done where that whiny, abrasive, neurotic personality doesn't diminish the movie.  And I can't think of any movie he's been in that virtually ANY other actor could not have done better.  That includes Close Encounters, the Goodbye Girl, What About Bob, etc.  Honestly, I try to avoid his films at all costs - but a couple of these had good stories and other good actors.  This movie is one of those.  So I was compelled to watch it.  But it makes you wish at several points in the movie that they would have just killed off his character and gone in a different direction.  It was a mistake to try and build a great movie around him, and obviously, I'm still unhappy that they tried.  I don't know who's life he saved, or who he loaned money to - but somebody clearly was forced to put him in.  He, by himself, brought this movie down two full stars.  Still a good one, but it could have been really superb without him.  Well, there it is.  Richard, I hope you run across this review someday and understand how much I really despise the fact that you "made it" to the big screen when so many other deserving, talented actors did not.  You sir are living proof that there is no justice in this world.  Enjoy my review!
2 ||| This movie is a cult classic for sure, but not my cup of tea. Fortunately it was only a gift for someone else since I like watching movies that have a lot more engaging material and dialogue than this one.
0 ||| Be warned that if you buy the streaming video version of this movie (rent is not an option) you are not getting a film version of this movie, but the hacked up narrow screen version that is formatted for TV. It's also low resolution and essentially looks like someone recorded it off of their television on a DVD recorder 10 years ago.  It's a huge ripoff and there's no excuse for amazon to be selling this version. I am very disappointed. If this is what they're selling, they should lower the price and INFORM the customer that it's not actually the "movie" version.
2 ||| Entertaining and suspenseful on first viewing, a closer reading reveals the film's rather disturbing subtext, which effectively explains away what are, after all, crimes against people, as the understandable prerogatives of a Master Race:  i.e. too high above us to notice our "rights" and stuff.  Sig Heil! Mr. Spielberg?
2 ||| This is one of my all time favorites.  My expectations were a bit high for what to expect in the Blu-Ray format here.  The transfer is decent, at best.  Sounds was fantastic.  There was a lot of graininess in some of the low light shots.  Because there are three versions of the movie on one disk, my guess is that the compression may have been a bit higher.  This might explain the surprisingly low quality of the Blue-Ray version.
0 ||| This movie is a bit overhyped, I am not going to argue the movie has good acting and special effects,and that perhaps we may not be alone. I really like the scene on the highway near the train tracks and The chase,*SPOILER*but really "Roy" is such a jerk and leaves to join the mothership? I would hope they torture him up there for being such a bad father and husband. probe him good. I also dislike spielberg for commenting "If we can communicate with beings from another planet peacefully then why not The Reds during the Cold War?" something to that effect. Spielberg must be one helluva naive person to state something like that and believe it. I also believe that Aliens wouldn't come here, Humans are too dumb,why bother. And if they did come they would probably destroy us. I would never want to have an encounter, The movie itself is not bad,but you go back to one place(India) then another (Muncie,Indiana) why not focus on One place and one plot? I prefer Signs to this. And the end of this movie totally killed it for me. See for yourself whether you agree or disagree with my review.it's not a bad movie  but certainly could have been better.
2 ||| Idle Hands is a fun dark comedy about teenagers dealing with brutal murder, horrible curses and prom.  Absolutely worth the watch if you want a few good chuckles.
0 ||| the blu-ray print of this film is TERRIBLE!  no better than the older DVD copy i have owned for years.  i really don't think a film of this age is worthy of a blu-ray release unless the film has undergone a digital restoration specifically for the blu-ray print.  the sound is wonderful but the picture is very grainy and not crisp at all.  why waste your time and my money on releasing a new DVD that is no better than the old version?
0 ||| Stupid movie
2 ||| This movie has not aged well but its still fun, especially if you are watching it with someone who has never watched it. Definite Sunday afternoon wine and pop corn thing  to enjoy.
0 ||| The idea of an "everyman" confronting aliens is a great plot device, but Spielberg's ham fisted direction sinks this project. It COULD have been a classic. I was rather taken with it back when it played first-run, but now I can see that the effects work of Doug Trumbull and the music of John Williams were what really kept this afloat initially. Also, this blu-ray looks grainier than the theatrical presentation.

2 ||| This item is clearly stated by Amazon to be the DVD-Audio of the SOUNDTRACK, yet almost all the reviews treat it as if it were a DVD of the MOVIE.
0 ||| This is a joke of a movie. The plot (if you can call it like that) goes like this: guy sees some UFOs, gets a sunburn, goes berserk trying to re-create some kind of mound with mashed potatoes, dirt, etc. Guy tries to find the UFO. Woman loses her son to UFO. Both go to Devil's Tower to find the UFOs and aliens. Government says there is poisonous gas. There is no poisonous gas. Guy and woman find UFOs and aliens. Nothing happens.  Are you kidding me? This is a plot? And why do people give it 4 and 5 star ratings? What do you see that I don't? I am actually kind of a sci-fi fan, I like some of Spielberg's later movies (ET, Jurassic Park, A.I.), but this one? No way. It is just plain silly.
0 ||| ...I watched it at school, and everyone in my class was either sleeping or scratching their heads in confusion. I just don't understand why Spielberg made this movie...along the way, people started talking in random languages (pardon me for being vague, I don't remember WHICH languages) and, well...it was just weird. Why did they? I have no idea. The ending just baffled me...*spoiler* why did he walk onto the spaceship? HUH? Maybe I was just having a bad day, but it really made no sense to me. I was alternating between bored and frustrated at not understanding the 'plotline'.  Quite a poor effort, conclusively...this movie was weak.
2 ||| It's a classic.  Just a little outdated.  Wasn't very exciting, but overall a pretty good movie.
1 ||| Repeat "title" function is not available as is the case with alot of Blu ray dvds. My opinion is about the user convenience aspect of this release.
1 ||| The movie focuses primarily on Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), an electric line repairman who goes to work one night to fix a massive power outage and sees several low flying spacecraft.  Many others see these craft including Gillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon from A Christmas Story) whose son is later abducted by the aliens.  At the same time, a group of researchers who apparently work for the government travels around the world gathering information on various alien sightings and encounters.  All of this comes together when everyone converges on one spot to find... well, that's the question that plagues all of them.  The government researcher scenes tend to be chaotic and confusing.  It's not unusual to have to sit through a few minutes of incomprehensible material before you can finally understand what's going on at the very end of the scene.  They also didn't add a whole lot to the film, especially given the amount of time they take up.  The plot line involving Roy Neary is the most interesting.  After his encounter, he's driven by strange compulsions but he doesn't understand what they mean or how to deal with them.  His family gets pretty freaked out, especially his wife (Teri Garr).  If his wife wasn't screaming all the time, this would have been a great story, but she gets old very quickly.  The climax of the film involves a light show that lasts about twenty minutes as various alien ships dart around, hover, and finally land.  They then play a rousing tune for a few minutes to communicate even though they give the earthmen no way whatsoever to put the notes into any meaning or context.  It felt like an endless nightmare watching this scene drag on and on before it was finally over.  I'm fine with a peaceful encounter but this could have been done in one fourth the time with absolutely nothing lost.  It's difficult for me to recommend this movie.  For hard-core sci fi or Spielberg fans, you should see it once for yourself because it is one of the milestones in the genre.  Anyone else can safely skip it since there are far more entertaining films for you to choose from.
1 ||| I may be the lone hold out, but.... on my Samsung DLP , the transfer is terrible. I am of the opinion that the HD transfer is also enhancing the grain of a thirty year old movie. The DNIe engine in my Samsung is making that grain more enhanced. Any family scenes in the house look like they're  in a snow storm. Other than that the outdoor scenes are great, and the colors and sound are awesome. If you have a Samsung DLP, though, you will have to watch it with the DNIe off. The picture is not as sharp, but the snow is not as bad. By the way, I looked at the regular DVD version in the same Blu- Ray player and there was a little grain, but no snow... with the DNIe engaged.  32 dollars wasted? Hard to say at this point. Anybody else having this problem?
2 ||| Yes, the collection of 3 versions of Close Encounters is great.  Yes, the picture and sound is awesome.  And yes, I am still glad that I bought it, but What is up with the Cheap Packaging, Cardboard Sleeve?  We spend more money on Blu-ray and HD DVDs because we know we are receiving a higher quality product, and that should be including the cases!  With hundreds of titles purchased, and uniformally placed on my shelf, this disc sticks out like a sore thumb.  Let's hope Sony doesn't make this mistake again.  I will pay more attention to the packaging details in my future purchases.
0 ||| If I had a husband that lost his job, didn't look for new work to support his family, trashes my kitchen, argues with me in front of our three kids, runs off to passionately kiss a single mom, then hops aboard a UFO, GOOD RIDDANCE!  The ending of the film should have been the aliens harvasting his organs. They wanted to know what a lousy earth husband was made of.
0 ||| Who likes this movie?  How could you possibly make sense of a film like this?  Steven Spielberg really messed up this time around, making a movie about space and yet most of it takes place on earth.  Duh...what kind of science fiction movie takes place on Earth in the 1970s?  This one, I guess.  If you like to see movies about Richard Dreyfus playing with carbs, then you'll love Close Encounters.  And special effects?  I don't know why they're considered so revolutionary because they're not half as good as anything I saw in ID4 (that's what I call Independence Day) or MIB II (Men in Black II) or iRobot or even Wild Wild West.  Apparently in Steven Spielberg's mind all space aliens are going to terrorize our planet after they arrive in a big Simon (complete with flashing colored lights and the annoying four musical notes)  The best thing about this movie is that it ends (sadly after 6 1/2 hours of people climbing on mountains and staring into the sky).  Photosynthesis is more fun to watch than this movie.  He's lost his skills since Star Wars.
0 ||| I love Speilberg films, I really do, but the fact that he is a good director is no excuse for this crap. I just do not like it, its not my thing. I can't belive that Richard Dreyfuss turned down reprising his role in Jaws 2 because he was filming this nonsense. If you want to watch it, then go ahead, we all have different tastes. However, if you want to see a real Speilberg film, watch ones like Duel, Jaws, ET, Schindler's list, Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, and The Indiana Jones Trilogy.
2 ||| not as good i thought it would be it  had its moments though. not for kids, mistake. you will like it if you like to sit around and get high
0 ||| This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is long and boring.  The main character is so easy to hate which makes the movie even harder to watch, when you wish he was dead. Not to mention the ending left me with the taste of rotting fecal in my mouth.  Final Review -------------  -5,321 Spielburg Snacks
2 ||| I bought the very same product on VHS tape (in widescreen).  I had hoped that this would truly make it an enhanced viewing experience, since it was on DVD.  Yes, it comes in a 2-DVD package, although the container itself is stupid to say the least. A flip-flop tray that has to be pulled out of a sleeve.  The second DVD doesn't offer much more, than the specials already included at the end of the videotape.  Granted, the sound is a bit better than its VHS counterpart, but was it worth it? NO!  Let me just compare it with the "LEGEND - Special Edition" 2-DVD release.  What did you get in that one?  First of all, since there were two versions of the "LEGEND" movie (a Europen/International and a U.S. version), you got them both.  Same feature was included in the "ALIEN" superbox, in which one got the theatrical releases and the special/director's cuts, back to back and in the "X-MEN" superbox, in which you can easily "reintegrate" the cut scenes of the theatrical versions with a push on your remote control.  Here you just receive Steven Spielberg's original vision and the cut/additional scenes are left to a special by itself, included in DVD 2.  The special contents are the very same as the ones included, as said earlier, at the end of the tape.  The interview with Spielberg is tedious and disenchanting. A man consumed by too much success speaks out and seems almost bored with what seems to have been his masterpiece of all times.  A man that has lost his original vision and is disenchanted with his own ideals of yesteryear is not very interesting at all. He's just old.  To impose it then to his "fans???" is stupid to say the least.  Maybe he is tired, maybe he is just plainly being sarcastic, or so I hope, 'cause if it is what the man truly feels about producing and directing his own movies (and having an extreme amount of luck in being able to do so at all, while many never get a chance in their lifetimes), seems like a slap in the face to those who have admired his work and his talent.  I, having watched the interview felt personally offended by his reviewed vision of things. Maybe I lack the "maturity???" he has achieved?  Nevertheless, I bought this, let me say, junk of a movie.  I even attributed it 3 stars in memory of the old glory it represented, when I first went to a movie theatre to watch it.  It hasn't improved one bit, being transferred onto DVD.  It just sits there, in my shelf, gathering dust.  I wanted to buy "E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial" Special Edition, but having seen this, I suspect it's the same-o, same-o as the Laser Disc version I already have and the special VHS widescreen tape I bought some years ago.  Nor am I enthused to have, as a special, the score conducted live by John Williams either. I'll rather wait until the "live" score will appear on audio CD one day, and then again, the question will still remain, will I still be interested in anything Steven Spielberg did?  As said, the decision to include such a disillusioned interview with Spielberg on a movie I have learned to cherish for years, made me think, and when I think, it is not usually a good thing.  I sometimes wonder whether this movie was made out of passion or plain and simply with a taste for money in mind.  These are things that irritate me immensely. It is as if Shakespeare would have put down all the works he had written and had considered them plain "youth junk".  Sorry Mr. Spielberg, a man that loses faith in his own visions, after having founded a family or not, has either been badly burned by life (which doesn't really seem to be the case with you), or he is plainly tired of his life as it is, in which case my honest suggestion would be, to change activity altogether and allow somebody else ready to carry your burden to emerge.  I have always detested winers, especially when they have reached the top and had so much luck with it.  Please take a moment and think about it, Mr. Spielberg.  Who made you what you are?  The Studios? The Executives? The Backers?  Or we, the audience?  Think, and think hard!  Sorry, I cannot recommend this product and unless somebody with more inventiveness and loyalty toward the audience will dish up both versions (in their entirety), with more uplifting and more interesting specials, I don't see why anyone would do himself so much harm as to waste his/her money in a clever "rehash" of the very same product.  By the way, since I am already at it. Please studios, distributors, directors and producers, do us all a big, immense favor.  Stop reissuing the same products in a dozen of different packagings, when the product itself is always the same.  It's a waste of time, talent, taste, money and a complete lack of true intelligence, creativity and intuitiveness.  I can only suppose that you are all better than that, so why don't you push yourselves harder to finally give us, the audience, better and more thoroughly thought of products?  You only stand to gain from it.  Just remember what Abraham Lincoln said:  "You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time."  A bit of respect to those who buy your products should be in order.  Do not ever dare assume that the masses are only formed by illiterate and uncouth people.  Unfortunately for you, there are also people out there able to scrutinize and judge you by your deeds.  There are even some, able to read between the lines.  So, please, become a bit wiser and show us that we are not just buyers, but rather chosers of your fate.  Yes, because ultimately it is us, the customers, who decide whether you have another day in business or not, not your fancy peers, nor your elegant, Armani clad, shareholders.  Keep that in mind, and you will be in business forever.  Forget it, and your life may be drastically changed by the twists of fate, and as we all know, fate cannot be influenced by one man alone.  This is it.  Buy it, my fellow customers, if you feel you have money to throw to the dogs. Refrain, if every penny is dear to you.  There are far better movies around.  This is just an old myth and getting older by the minute.
2 ||| Apparently, Spielberg said he made War of the Worlds because it would be `fun' to do nasty aliens for a change. But just how `cuddly and benevolent' were these particular ET's? They terrorise a mother to within an inch of her life, pulling her child out of her own arms leaving her distraught and not knowing whether he is alive or dead. Why did they do that when they had dozens of adult abductees that had perfectly useful mature brains for study? Nasty aliens. And what about those adult abductees? Second World War guys, torn from wives or girlfriends. True love gone forever. Their parents probably dead in the interim. On top of that trauma they now have to adjust to a new world where they don't fit in. The result: depression and alcoholism, maybe even suicide. Nasty, nasty aliens. Then to cap it all off they come out of their mother ship naked and expose themselves to the reception committee. Sexual assault can be extremely traumatic, resulting in long term psychological problems. Except the French guy who no doubt treats that sort of thing with a Gallic shrug. Nasty, nasty, nasty aliens.  Spielberg is fooling nobody but himself. See War of the Worlds, by the way, it's great. There's no plot, though.
1 ||| Can you believe, I have never seen CEO3K until the other week.  I looked forward to seeing it, but unfortunately it did not measure up. After hearing mixed reviews (so many of them referred to it as 'boring'), I was prepared to give it a go.  Close Encounters is very slow moving, with the occassional interesting thing occurring, but it is not until the end where something interesting happens.  And even then, I expected more.  I was left thinking "is that it, after all that slow build-up?".  Many scenes during the film are just too stupid for words.  I have viewed the 2-Disc collector's edition which apparently is a combination of the Director's Cut and the original theatrical version. For a first timer to the film, it made no difference to me. However, as fans of the film have stated, the tampering by Spielberg for this special edition was not appreciated.  He re-edited the original version removing scenes that perhaps gave it its popularity (eg. Dreyfuss entering the mothership).  Spielberg has said he will never re-instate these scenes. Doesn't it annoy you when a Director refuses to let people see a film the way they originally remember?  It's almost a kick in the teeth for helping him make his millions.  Oh well, at least he had the decency to allow the original 'untouched' version of E.T. to be included on the 2002 digitally enhanced version DVD.  The second disc of CE3K contains the extras which I guess would be gold for fans of the film. The DVD overall is a limited edition and at a price too - I am surprised at the price considering the film isn't that great.  I wish someone could enlighten me on why this film is considered a classic.
1 ||| Idle hands is a poorly made teenage serial killer film, in which a slacker teenager's hand is possessed and kills other teenagers.  Jessica Alba has a small part as a girlfriend.  Skip this film
2 ||| The trailers for "Idle Hands" implied the film was a madcap horror comedy when, in reality, the filmmakers created something more along the lines of "An American Werewolf in London." Granted, they don't come near the high water mark of that film, or even the later "Fright Night" or "The Lost Boys," but "Idle Hands" has genuine moments of horror along with its comedy, although neither element is particularly memorable.  From the icky premise to the icky undead friends acting as Greek chorus to the hot babe inexplicably drawn to the protagonist to the dark finale, "Idle Hands" bears the mark of the creators watching "American Werewolf" over and over and over again while creating this film.  Of course, it's not as though "An American Werewolf in London" is difficult to find at your local video store. For those looking for those sorts of thrills, stick with the original, as well as "Fright Night" and "Lost Boys."  "Idle Hands" is a recommended rental for fans of Seth Green or Jessica Alba, but other horror fans should give it a miss.
1 ||| Which isn't a good thing. If you've seen any recent horror flicks within the past 10 years(Taking Lives, Wrong Turn, I Still Know What you Did Last Summer, Scream), then you know it's filled with the dummest imaginable good guys, cheesy plot and almost un-killable bad guys. And scenes that are supposed to thrill you and you just wonder when this is going to end. I almost fell asleep in a few of those movies, that's how lame, tiring and boring they are. Fortunately, for this film, it has Jessica Alba and Seth Green, who are two fantastic actors/actresses and are always delightful to see. Seth Green is hilarious as the main characters buddy, and Jessica Alba is more then sexy. However, the movie is beyond cheesy(like a hand jumping out a microwave through the window, smashing the glass in the mean time and landing in the bush, but it can't escape the microwave. Or, when the lady(played by Vivica A. Fox(Kill Bill)) is hit by a car, which is backing up, and then is sent 50 feet. Uh huh, that's realistic. Ends sarcasm.) Then there is tones of un-necessary gore and silly scenes like the guy losing his head. And how exactly did his buddies get back? They don't explain anything and assume everything is magical. It delivers the comedy pretty well, thanks to Seth Green for that, but is just too silly, far too cheesy and extremely lame(a hand that is possessed? Please, give me a break.)
2 ||| "Idle Hands" starts as a horror film, but after the opening 10 minutes, it's very obvious that this movie is also a comedy. This film features some spoofs to classic horror films like "The Shining", "The Evil Dead" or "The Night Of The Living Dead". As a matter of fact, "Idle Hands" works better as a comedy than as a horror film.   The cast includes a lot of young actors like Devon Sawa (Anton), Seth Green (Mick), Elden Hensen (Pnub) and Jessica Alba (Molly). We already know that Seth Green is very funny and Jessica Alba is charming, but the surprise in this movie is Devon Sawa. He uses a lot of physical tricks and shakes his hand in a funny and convincing way.   The plot is kinda silly and obviously has holes here and there, but the dialogues are the main attraction here, the characters talk in double sense, with irony and black humor, and they make a lot of funny references to Anton's hand, Pnub's severed head or the bottle inserted into Mick's head.   This an amusing movie, it's good enough to entertain the audience for 90+ minutes, the MTV 2 soundtrack features tracks performed by bands like The Offspring, Rancid and Rob Zombie. "Idle Hands" is a movie for young people looking for laughs, it's much better than the average teenager slasher flick. And by the way, Jessica Alba looks gorgeous in "Idle Hands".
0 ||| The film  "Close Encounters" is one of the best Spielberg ever directed,some would argue THE best and I would be hard pressed to counter that assertion. This is indeed a wonderful movie ,a film that works on multiple levels and on a grand scale that focuses on the people that have encountered UFOs up close and personal. Spielberg even gave the late Prof. Allen Hynek famed UFO researcher from North Western University a cameo role near the end of the picture to lend it an even more realistic touch. However Spielberg has stated more than once that he would NEVER release the movie as it was originally shown and true to his word he has so far stubbornly carried out his promise. His reasoning on this point totally baffles this reviewer. It IS a wonderful film,what is the problem Mr. Spielberg? Therefore if you  would like to see an uncut/original version of this film,NOTHNG at ths time of writing is available to satisfy your desire. Nor does it look promising for the forseeable future. What a pity. I have viewed every version released on video and DVD and each one changes the feel and direction of the movie in some way and none of them match the impact and intent of the original. Be patient and stay tuned...but don't buy yet!
1 ||| Let me be direct: 90% of the movie sucks. The acting and effects are decent. But the story, the direction, and well, pretty much everything else, are bad. A few minutes into the movie, I thought it was a horror movie. Even then I was disappointed because it's not nearly horrifying enough. Then a third of the movie gone by, the plot became more and more ridiculous, and only then did I realize that the filmmakers wanted to make it a black comedy. But just that the movie has the style of a black comedy doesn't mean that the filmmakers would feel obliged to offer you any laughs, witty dialouges or dark humor. The movie has none of those. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 star is some really really terrible movies deserve the lowest grade more than this one does. Not by a lot, though, I have to say.
2 ||| a stoner kids hand makes him start killing people.his 2 best friends return as zombies.eventualy he chops it off and it runs loose killing people.a whole bunch of nobodies are in it.it is low budget.doesnt anyone spend money on a horror film?it is really good though.there are a few ladies running about.a mexican chick next door,[ok people christineaguliera is yesterdays news and just because shes hot doesnt mean every spanish chick in the world is}.then theres this crazy jewish-black priestess chick who wants to kill everything and finaly the only hot chick in the movie is a chick whose in the film long enough to take off her shirt and get murdered.the priestess is obnoxious.this movie is a lot more entertaining than any sell outs and phonies will admit to.i don't know what on earth theyd do for a sequel but id love to see them try.
2 ||| IDLE HANDS has more misses than hits, but one can't help but find the overall movie amusing.  Devon Sawa does a very good job with his possessed hand, some have already mentioned it's likeness to Steve Martin in ALL OF ME.  Bringing back his friends (Seth Green, Elden Henson) as zombies is a direct ripoff from both American Werewolf movies, and even though derivative as such, are buoyant and fun.  Viveca Fox as the hand hunter is hilarious, as is Jack Noseworthy as the pseudo-studly Randy.  There is lots of gore, pot smoking, even nutmeg/oregano smoking, but in this day and age, what teen movie wouldn't have it.  The overuse of soundtrack songs is as always distracting, but again, when one targets a teen audience, this is what one gets.  However, the musical score itself by Graeme Revell is very good.  This is one of those movies you watch when you need a good laugh, and even though it's not as funny as you want it to be, it still delivers.
0 ||| tried to watch , I couldn't make it all the way through. plot was bad. his has were posessed? eww gross. only good thing about this movie is j. alba
2 ||| First of all I will say that if you read this review and have not seen the movie, you may want to skip it all the way to the last sentence or two.  Well, anyway, I enjoyed this film, yet I feel I've been down this road before.  The only real difference is that the characters are all a bunch of stoners, for the most part.  It involves one particular stoner who wakes up one morning and finds his parents are not around, though he seems too stoned to care.  Though there is a serial killer on the loose, all he cares about is scoring some more weed...which, to most stoners, is pretty right on the target.  He comes to find out later that HE is actually the killer!  Big surprise!  I won't say anymore about the plot though.  If you've seen Evil Dead or Re-Animator, you're really in for nothing new to the genre.  The gore scenes are pretty interesting, but nothing to really single it out as a gore classic either.  Mediocre at best, Idle Hands only really stands out in the defiant attitude of the time it was released just nearly a week after the Columbine Massacre.  The DVD has got some interesting features, including a good deleted scene, but it's a little murky.
1 ||| Remember all those really campy films from the 1950s such as The Crawling Hand?  Idle Hands is basically the same type of movie, only much sillier, much campier, and in some respects embarrassingly bad.  The filmmakers really don't even bother to explain the whole silly concept; a corporeal, murderous hand on the rampage normally doesn't need a lot of background info, but in this case Anton (Devon Sawa) simply has his own hand somehow possessed without the rogue hand causing all the mischief even finding him.  Only after Anton cuts his hand off, do we return to the more traditional animated, murderous hand on the rampage theme, and that works much better than Anton's constant battle to control what his right hand is doing as long as it is attached to his arm.  As far as the rest of the explanation goes, we have a Druidic priestess (Vivica A. Fox) trying to find and destroy the hand before midnight Druid time, at which time the hand will take a soul into the netherworlds.  In my opinion, this story doesn't even begin to work. A little bit of comedy is supplied by the always-funny Seth Greene (who plays Mick) and his buddy Pnub (Elden Henson).  These two, along with Anton, are the triumvirate of lazy, pot-smoking teens (just the type of victim said hand likes to prey upon).  Probably the funniest part of the film involves the reappearance of an undead Pnub and Mick (who carries his severed head around with him most of the time); the staircase to heaven, they said, was just too far to walk, so they decided to just stay on earth.  The only bright spot in this film, and the only reason I wanted to see it, is Jessica Alba.  I was somewhat amazed to see some of the facial expressions and attitudes she would later display in her role in the incredibly good TV series Dark Angel. Idle Hands is just too stupid to be at all horror-inspiring, and it is too stupid to even be funny for the most part.  I usually love these types of campy films, but in this case I would have to say that the fellow with the most idle hands of all was the scriptwriter, as he really didn't give us much of a story for this film.
1 ||| "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" was a movie I fondly remember from my youth as kindling that spark of cinema magic that seems to be in short supply these days.  For its day the visual effects were mesmorizing and the prospect that we are not alone in this universe became very real for me after viewing this movie.  Plot: People from all walks of life are brought to the Arizona desert by a series of space ship visits to our planet earth. Columbia Tristar has really angered me with this release.  Steven Spielberg should be none too thrilled with them either.  Their 2 disc special edition presents his masterpiece in a digitally grainy, thoroughly unsatisfying visual quality topped off by excessive aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement, low contrast levels, colors that bleed and an overall visual characteristic that ranges from too, too soft to digitally harsh.  There's no happy medium.  The arrival of the alien mother ship is totally ruined by excessive pixelization that breaks up fine details.  This is not the way I want to remember this sci-fi classic.  The soundtrack is dated but overall well represented.  The extras include a making of that is informative but a direct import from Columbia's laserdisc and some extra test and rehearsal footage that is somewhat dry.  I think Columbia would do wise to just hand over their film library to more capable hands to preserve.  Of late their transfers have gotten even worse than this.  However with this DVD release, there was a definite beginning to that end!
1 ||| I had been hearing how great this movie was but I had never seen it. So I bought the dvd. I was a little disappointed. This version has the added scenes that were not shown in the original theatrical release, and maybe that is what I don't like. It is slow and too long. If you have already seen it and liked it then this is a good dvd, but if you haven't scene it, I would rent it first, just in case.
1 ||| Close Encounters has great special effects and an amazing light show but the story is so humorless, cold and sterile, I cannot recommend this movie. We're supposed to sympathize with Richard Dreyfuss's character who becomes possessed with a vision imparted within him by super-intelligent, super-sensitive aliens.  But how can anyone sympathize with a man who willingly throws away his wife and children to follow some vague abstract space vision. And yet we're not supposed to think of Dreyfuss as a victim of an alien-induced obsession.  Rather, Spielberg wants us to be in awe of and admire these aliens who are, in Spielburg's view, a more intelligent, advanced enlightened species than the human species.  But the facts of his story completely contradict this Spielberg vision of alien goodness and virtue.  The aliens kidnap and/or brainwash innocent people for no apparent reason and yet, because they're "sensitive" and intelligent, we're supposed to go "awwww" and think how wonderful they are. The acting is fair but nothing special.  The only truly good acting performance is by Teri Garr who realistically and grippingly shows what is like to have one's life turned upside down by a spouse who's caught in the grip of an obsession.  Other than Ms. Garr, the rest of the cast is either way over-the-top (Dreyfuss) or forgettable. Close Encounters is long, pretentious, sometimes dull, but often visually interesting to look at.  If you want to see a great light show, rent it.  If you want to watch a compelling movie, look somewhere else.
2 ||| Wow, this movie was incredibly terrible. "Idle Hands" are the devil's playground. Nobody cares. Anton (Devon Sawa) is a teenager who uses his inhaler as an 'instrument.' Not cool dude. His right hand then becomes possessed and starts to murder. His parents, family and almost his girlfriend (Jessica Alba). That hand deserved major punishment going after "Dark Angel" like that. Aside from the horrible plot, watch this movie because of how good Jessica Alba looks, nothing else.
1 ||| Idle hands is hopefully at the end of a cycle of horror flixs that was started in 1996 by Scream, a satire of the slasher pictures of the 70s. Like all cycles in the movie business, this one has been brought down by the weight of too many cheap and derivative knockoffs When this happens, it finally doesn't matter if a movie in the category is good or not. People don't buy it. Ironically, the next big cycle was kicked off this summer by another, albeit more sophisticated and serious, horror genre - the psychological horror / ghost story [The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense]. Idle Hands is further handicapped by being neither one of the best nor one of the worst of the "scream" cycle. It starts off well enough. The time is Halloween. What other time is there? Young Anton's parents retire to bed. After the lights go out, they see an ominous message written on the ceiling. All hell breaks loose, and this sequence unspools like a twisted situation comedy. The next morning, Anton [Devon Sewa] wakes up, oblivious to the fact that his parents have gone missing. But then the teenager is oblivious to almost everything except drugs, sex and rock and roll, as are his two best friends, Mick and Pnub [Seth Green and Elden Ratliff]. As the day progress, it becomes apparent that one of Anton's hands has taken on a mind of its own. It has become homicidal. Most of the funniest moments in the movie show the boy and his deranged hand fighting for control. Devon Sewa, like Jim Carrey, is a very physical actor. Idle Hands is a homage to many old movies. The uncontrollable hand reminds me of a Peter Sellers character, Dr. Stranglove, in the movie of the same name. The opening pays tribute to Halloween, while the dance scene is straight out of Carrie. Anton's ghostly friends are just like the ones in An American Werewolf in London. One problem is that Idle Hands is nowhere near as good as the movies it salutes. The bigger problem is that every character is self-centered and stupid. The writer and the director do not understand that, even when a movie is a horror satire, if the audience cannot relate to any character, interest quickly wanes. One morning Anton discovers his parents have been whacked, and, by that night, he's trying to make it with the girl next door. You can laugh at this idiot, but do you really care about him? This is not to say that there are no clever scenes in the movie. It is to say that the audience's involvement remains superficial. It's one of those pictures that leaves no impact and is forgotten by the next day.
0 ||| There's nothing wrong with this movie, if you like a bunch of bad tasted sequences, terrible acting, bad horror, this is the movie for you.
2 ||| I would really rate this as 3.5 stars but not 4, so I'm forced to give it a 3. First off, the movie overall is excellent. Heck, I was 11 years old when this came out and I LIVED in Muncie, Indiana when it was released. The theater went nuts when the subtitle came on, saying "Muncie, IN", and then seeing Roy wearing a Ball State University shirt, well that just got the crowd in the theatre all worked up. We loved it! I saw the "Special Edition" on VHS when it came out. I was a little diasppointed at the time when the scene with Roy tearing up his lawn was removed from that edition. However, I wasn't as disappointed with that version as I am with this. Many of the scenes from the 1st SE have been moved off to the second DVD as deleted scenes. A bad choice in my opinion. However, those scenes that were missing in the SE from the original release are back in with some other new scenes plonked in as well. Still, it's a disappointment with the other scenes missing. But, the other features on the second DVD are great. But, I wish Columbia/TriStar would take notice of how James Cameron released T2 - The Ultimate Edition. In that release, you have the choice of 3 versions of the movie on the same DVD: The original theatrical release, the Special Edition which came out a few years later on VHS, and then a third version with more deleted scenes in addition to the SE version. I don't know why Columbia/TriStar/Spielberg couldn't have done the same for Close Encounters. The picture itself is great and the sound is excellent. Much better than the original release back in 1977, but of course, technology for sound has improved vastly since then, so it's not a surprise. Still, it's amazing how the sound can make a difference in how a movie is presented. To have this on DVD is a must. Now, if Spielberg would release the Indiana Jones movies and Lucas would release the 2nd trilogy of Star Wars as well on DVD, my sci-fi/action DVD collection would be almost complete.
2 ||| 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' is more of a children's movie.  Although adults will appreciate it, most of them will wonder what was the point behind it.  On a crystal clear summer night, average citizens witness what appear to be UFOs in the sky.  For some the UFOs affect them more than others.  A child, his mother, Richard Dreyfuss, and a dozen other unnamed people begin seeing visions in their head.  They see a geographical structure, but can't make sense of it.  Later they find out it is Devil's Tower in the west.  Cut between these stories are small stories of strange events happening across the world; stretching from Mexico to India.  In the middle of the Gobi desert, a seaship is found. Finally our heros, Richard Dreyfuss and a woman reach the Devil's Tower for the climax.  The climax is enjoyable if one of able to make sense of it.  Some people will look at it and say, "Wow look at all the pretty spaceships!"  Maybe Speilberg was trying to entertain and mystify us for two hours, which he does at certain momements.  I guess what he's trying to say is, "Aliens are not harmful.  They are here to make peace with us."  But at the end, when the gigantic spaceship rises behind Devil's Tower, the only thing I was thinking was, "Wow the only thing bigger than that spaceship is Speilberg's ego!"
0 ||| What more need be said about this other than that it is a film by Spielberg, the insipid director who brought us such films as "Always" or "Hook", other than that he is the worst filmmaker since Bill Rebane? This early effort is even more idiotic than most of his more recent, half-hearted efforts. This film is an incredibly boring, almost plotless, overlong borefest that may well cure you of insomnia by boring you to death. Also, a special note to the manufacturers of this disk: This is the 21st century! We want more than just some sorry movie on the disk. If all we the public wanted was the movie we would gladly buy the VHS. For your next release, try putting some worthwhile extra features on the disk. At least then you might be able to trick the public into thinking they are getting something worth the money they paid.

1 ||| This is the kind of movie that would be compared to something like Chopper Chicks in Zombietown. It has all the laughs, some frights, but too funny to take seriously. That's the issue with Idle Hands. Devon Sawa doesn't take the fact that his parents are dead very emotionally, which is weird. The only part of this movie I really hate is the ending. It completely stunk, and made me agree that it was only a two and a half star movie. There are a lot of people who still like this movie and I hink it's great. But to give this film three stars is silly. I could watch this movie again and still find it funny. That's about how good it is.
1 ||| The humor is low and the horror is high! This teen flick will nauseate your stomahcs as Antoin Tobias (Devon Sawa) stars as a drug atic who sits around like a slug and disovers his hand has been possessed by Lucifer and he must stop it before he kills anyone else besides his parents! Jesica Alba stars as his hot girlfriend and Seth Green stars as Devon's duggy friend as well! NOT RECOMMENED! Rated R for nudity, strong horror violence, drug use and language.
1 ||| what's the idea behind it, I spent the whole evening thinking of what they want us to see, it's violent movie, full of killing scenes. I saw horror movies before let's take an example (Blair Witch) this is something for real you feel your body shake like a blinder and you spend the whole night wake. this movie is not like this, they want to say that ideal hands are devils playground !!! or they just want us think that smoking drugs will cause you to do bad things, actually I do not recommend it.
1 ||| I read and heard amazing reviews for this movie, so I wanted to like this movie... I really did. The cast is amazing! However, I did not like it. Too predictable, cheesy, and the line that made cringe in my seat was when the son asks the mother if she can teach his dad how to tie the shoe laces like she does. It seemed like an insensitive line, like the boy had no feelings for his mother. And the ending was the worst... I don't know I just did not get on this bandwagon.
1 ||| I vividly remember seeing "CE3K" as a teenager and I especially remember the ads with the long stretch of highway and the ominous quote "We are not alone!". Seeing the film 25 years later makes me wonder what all the fuss was about. This has to be one of Steven Spielberg's most overated films. It resembles a tv mini-series, long and plodding, and follows a select group of characters and their experiences with UFO sightings and abductions. I'm all for character development but most of these characters get stale really quick and you just want them to get on with it! As with many early Spielberg films, there are lots of noisy, irritating kids and messy houses which are meant to represent suburbia. After a long hour and a half, these people finally make it to Devil's Tower, where the aliens arrive and communicate with humans. This sequence is still dazzling, but basically just amounts to a spectacular light and sound show. And, oh yes, that five note tone gets really irritating by the end of the movie! I was disappointed with the quality of the dvd as well. There is a highly noticable "shimmering" in the interogation scene between Dreyfess and the government agents. Also, the night sky scenes looked uneven with streaks of gray overlapping the blacks. Many scenes were "soft" and uneven. The bonus disc, however, is very nice and contains great interviews and a documentary about the making of the film.
2 ||| I remember seeing this at the theater and thought the DVD would be a good addition to my collection. My memory of the story was better than the DVD turned out to be. Too many special effects have happened since this movie first came out, and they make the ones in Close Encounters look contrived. I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought it would. If you find it on sale you might want to pick it up.
1 ||| Yer another comedy flop. The film promises, but never quite delivers. Sure it's corny, hammy and dumb and for a while it's funny, but towards the end it just becomes stupid. These teen comedies don't really appeal to me, but the small horror content of this film saves it from being boring. It just could have been much funnier.
0 ||| Well, all you'll get watching this freak movie is a little bit of gore ( bad special effects, by the way .. )and some young actors who seem to be wearing skirts yet ... Sad. Skip it.
0 ||| Some fellow below said this is the best movie ever ....Uau... THis is a dishonest "horror" movie, taking some bad teen actors, adding some badly produced gore, making funnyless jokes all around ... Everyhting failed miserably here ( and I like to watch ridiculous horror movies, like "SCREAMS", "NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET",etc, just for the sake of laughing ). But this one is so bad, I almost ejected the tape from my VCR in the middle of it. A shame that actor so young accept to shoot this kind of garbage.
1 ||| this is a completely boring film and one of Spielberg's worst films. Usually his movies are fantastic, like Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, or even E.T., but this so damn slow and plodding! And this is coming from someone who loved Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey! Trust me, this movie is worthless, watch it only if you want to fall asleep in front of the TV.
2 ||| If you've got the time to spare (and who didn't back in 1977?) then re-watching this old timer with a good picture is probably worth it. No commentary, but everything you would need to know is in the making of featurette, including tiredy looking Steven Spielberg on a Private Ryan set. He's a family man now, so he says he can't make movies about faithless men who leave their wives for a bunch of baloney. Why not? I suspect he may, like Lucas, be being put out to pasture soon.
0 ||| I was sorely disappointed with this movie. I loved it when I was a kid, but after watching it for the first time since it was in theatres, I just wasn't impressed at all. I saw the DVD and couldn't resist, but I wish I would have. This has got to be one of the slowest movies I've ever seen. Spielberg never has been too impressive in my opinion, but this is pathetic. At least Jaws and E.T. have some action throughout the entire movie. Here you get a small glimpse of the alien happenings at the beginning, 1.25 hours of boredom, and an ending that just wasn't nearly as good as it was when I was kid. My kids couldn't stand it, so it's obviously not a timeless classic, like the other space/alien movies of the late 70s early 80s.
0 ||| THis movie is ridiculous. Even watching it as a black-horror comedy, it is horrible. To show gore is the only goal of the movie and even this fails, because the special effects are stupid. This could be a "trash" or "B" movie great picture, but everyone involved (teen actors, director, etc) are uninspired. This was a shame to the horror genre, which already is full of prejudices against it.
1 ||| Depending on who you are, you will either enjoy this film or think it is rather stupid and insipid.  I happen to fall into the latter category, and  although I do believe there are good movies aimed at that particular  audience (teens) I don't feel this is it..  The writing is underdeveloped,  with a story that is, although has its moments, seems to be trying to hard  to be humourous while still maintaining its horror element - resulting in a  graphic gore element mixed with botched comedy.  This, like HALF BAKED,  seems to support dope smoking, although the interpretation can be that that  is the reason Anton's two friend's end up dead and he has a possessed hand  because he is lazy and is going no where with his life.  Yet this is  nullified when the kids still smoke it at the end, contributing the end to  `good marijuana'  The main character's name I figured was a nod to Anton  LaVey, who is the founder of the modern day Satanic church.  There is no  explanation given why Anton's two friends come back from the dead, other  than they just didn't want to go `toward the light'.  In a scene  reminiscent of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD they come out of the ground,  providing gross humour.  Like the horror genre it is more of a spoof of  than an actual example, there is nudity (two kids decide to fornicate and  are dressed in KISS costumes). All in all, a bad movie that is aimed at  the teen-age genre with pointless drugs and a bad script.  I do like Seth  Green, however.  He is one of the few redeeming factors (that and the  movie's refusal to take itself seriously) in this B flick.
2 ||| A lazy pothead that spends his whole day lying around, watching TV and smoking bongs suddenly finds out that his right hand is possessed and goes on a killing spree. Loaded with a lot of grusome scenes like somebody  getting a broken beer bottle shoved through his head and another guy  getting his head cut off is actually a lot  funnier than some would think.  Although it is nothing terribly special, its allot better than most in its  genre and is deffinately worth watching. As a DVD its very good. The  picture and sound quality is reasonable and it has quite a lot of good  extras. Any horror fan should have it.
1 ||| I LOVE Spielberg, please don't get me wrong. I even kinda liked this movie when I first saw it all those many years ago. But we watched it with our kids (13 & 8) in the year 2000 and they hated it, and frankly, I dozed off myself. Science fiction is the hardest genre to keep fresh for generations, for obvious reasons, but some core elements of film-making never go out of style. It feels so self-important and plodding. The pace is slow and the special effects no longer have the power to stun. And the movie doesn't really surprise.  There is no ultimate mystery to the plot.  Yes, one might wonder what the aliens are like, but we never doubt that they're there, that Dreyfuss will get to see them and that nothing bad will happen.  The movie never builds up any truly engrossing tension.  We feel safe throughout, and wouldn't you think that the world, getting ready to see aliens for the first time, would feel more frightened (and the viewer more frightened)? It's fun to hear the "alien theme" music again, and Richard Dreyfuss is very good. But Francois Truffaut?? Why did Speilberg cast him?  He's usually so assured with his ununsual casting choices (Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams?  Great idea!  Roy Scheider in Jaws?  Oprah Winfrey in Color Purple?  He's so often gone with unknowns or unusual choices and we've usually been SO pleasantly surprised). I don't want to dwell on this too much, but CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is a piece of movie history, but sadly, not a living, breathing one.
2 ||| Ah well...yet another example of a minority of rational reviews having ten times the substance and validity of the majority of commercially-biased, lemming, nostalgia-tainted, and/or plainly ignorant reviews here on ... .  Fortunately, I've gotten used to their overall level of trustworthiness and now never buy anything sight-unseen based on them alone; I rented this film first and can now sleep just fine knowing it doesn't have a place in my collection after all. This is one incredibly overrated film.  Previous reviews were more accurate than I could be in describing its numerous points of weakness, but the one that stood out for me was the story, and in particular the over-the-top, contrived situations and characters that go beyond believable and just destroy the viewer's suspension of disbelief (assuming said viewer has a 3-digit IQ) no matter how hard they want to maintain it and stay in the film world. I was very young when this film came out, so I have the luxury of judging this film on its own merits and not with the taint of childhood film hype or nostalgia.  Those of you burdened with either of them will disregard reviews of it anyway and can't be convinced that this is anything but a masterpiece.  To the rest who believe they might fall into the same category as me, ...
2 ||| "Idle hands are the Devil's play things." There you have the basic concept of this film. Well, sort of. The basic idea is that a slacker wakes up one day to discover his hand is possessed and when it is not busy,  it is trying to kill everyone around him-including his best friends. He  does kill them actually, and they come back as zombies who mock  him. Sound weird? It gets weirder. This movie is more of a horror-spoof  than an actual horror film, yet its scary moments are much better done  than, say, those of Scream. Then when it turns to comedy and parody it  excels! The movie is actually really funny, and it takes itself so lightly,  that you get the feeling the cast and characters they play are laughing  right along with you. Idle Hands is a fun film that any horror fan should  enjoy. It doesn't do what so many films unfortunately do today-take itself  too seriously.
1 ||| How very strange...usually I'm the one giving great reviews for the things everyone else hates, but here... The premise has some potential: A boy's hand is possessed and no longer obeys him. And the movie has much fun with  that, and I'm sure Devon Sawa had a lot of fun with his hand. But the movie  is really unimpressive. You have to wonder how much pot the *writer* was  actually on, because that's pretty much what the movie revolves around:  smoking lots of pot. As in most movies, the requisite girl (played here  by Jessica Alba) has nothing better to do but to be a sexual object, and be  in danger. She is apparently a "songwriter/musician" but that's  just thrown in there for the hell of it and has no purpose whatsoever. In  fact, none of the female characters here are at all developed. The  "evil-fighter" just randomly appears. The other girl has no point  but to die. The movie is mindlessly gory. I award the movie two stars for  having a message against laziness (which is overtly stated by Sawa), having  Seth Green, and being fun at some points.
2 ||| This is an excellent movie.  Everything about it is memorable.  The reason I only gave it three stars is that the movie is in full screen format, not widescreen.  Considering I paid $11.00 for the dvd, I would have thought it would be in widescreen for an older film.  This is one problem I have with ordering films online, Amazon in particular.  They used to specify what format the film was, but rarely do, now.
2 ||| Steven Spielberg's epic film that brainwashed the world into accepting alien invaders with open arms and a five-note melody arrives in a great looking two disc set that includes a fascinating new 102 minute "making-of" documentary and 10 deleted scenes.  The lush 137 minute widescreen transfer is apparently the third version of the film and is Spielberg's definitive version.  For now.  Rated PG.
1 ||| First of all let me just say that this movie has the worst anticlimatical ending of all time: there's no verbal or telepathic communications established with the aliens, no sense of what their intentions are, no reason mentioned for why they've abducted people, no reason to explain why Richard Dreyfuss' character is the "chosen one", and worst of all we (the audience) are left to believe that a stupid little hand gesture means that everything is all hunky-dory with the aliens- case closed, everything is all right with the aliens because Steven Spielberg says so. Don't worry about cattle mutilations or any of those other violent abductions you've been hearing about, everything's all fine and dandy. The first half of the movie was good, but for some reason they decided to turn it into some watered-down, cheesy, leave-the-audience-feeling-secure kind of movie during the last half. Another reviewer mentioned the movie 2001 and compared it to Close Encounters, all I have to say is that they're completely different from each other- one has a philosophical message and one doesn't. Basically this movie is for those who wanna lie to themselves and say that there's nothing to worry about. 2001 is definitely the movie to see if your interested in aliens- im not saying it's real (who knows though?), but its sure more engaging than Close Encounters.
2 ||| Okay movie, but not as good as I thought it would be.
2 ||| Not my type of movie!
0 ||| Good story, very current. I hope writers keep writing interesting stories like this. Enjoyed the ending, very positive, loved it.
2 ||| The parentheses are because I believe, can't be sure, that this sub-genre has been erased in some form of political correctness; at any rate, "weepy woman's picture", which is what it is, is accurate in its descriptive power, if not in its acceptability. Julia Roberts, naturally, is very good to look at, Susan Sarandon is not bad either; despite this, they play the parts of the wife-to-be and the ex-wife excellently. The modern, hip, touch is that the wife-to-be is living with the ex-husband and husband to be, Ed Harris, in the role of step mom to his children, who, in the course of the things, will become her step-children.  Ed Harris, manages to keep smiling ,playing fifth significant person to the two women and, in point of fact, to his 12 year old daughter and ca, 8 year old son. This is the kind of film in which men are just a backdrop to the two women (as in the days of Davis and Hopkins). The film goes on too long for what it has to say, becoming tedious by the Christmas Day ending. Whether it will seem tedious to viewers who like this sort of thing, I cannot say. At any rate, as far as I can tell, those who like this kind of film, will like this one.
0 ||| 'Stepmom' features the conflict between the ex (Susan Sarandon) and her replacement (Julia Roberts), augmented by the childrens' natural loyalties to their mother. Lots of tart-tongued dialogue in the beginning, with preventable and meaningless conflicts at the PTA, the home, etc. Eventually they come together, drawn by the ex's slow death from cancer. Maudlin, boring, and way too long.
0 ||| I didnot like this movie. I thought it would be good because Julia Roberts were in it. (WRONG). It was just as boring as it could be. Watch Pretty Woman for a outstanding Julia Roberts performance.
2 ||| I watch this movie because I love Ed Harris and his eyes:) and the Victorian House in the woods!! These two things are worth watching the movie for.
0 ||| I bought this DVD for my collection.  I do not buy full screen format DVDs.  Amazon described the DVD as "Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Full Screen, Widescreen, NTSC" with an aspect ration of 2.35:1.  However, when it arrived, it was Full Screen only with an aspect ratio of 1:33.1.  Consequently, I returned it.  My recommendation, if you only want Widescreen, don't believe the description that this DVD is dual-layered and don't buy it.
0 ||| Julia Roberts plays Ed Harris' young new wife. Susan Sarandon plays Harris' ex-wife. Ex-wife does not like new wife. New wife does not like ex-wife. Ex-wife's cutsey, but bratty kids make new wife's life a living hell. Ex-wife thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo. New wife thinks ex-wife is a nagging battle axe. New wife and ex-wife fight and yell at each other ad nauseum. How does the film solve this conflict? Ex-wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer -- everyone reconciles, ex-wife and new wife suddenly love each other ... the end. Nothing like a convenient disease-of-the-week solution in lieu of a well-written, plausible resolution to the conflict. This is one of the most cliched, saccharine and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by Hollywood in the past decade. All of the acting talent in this film is wasted in support of a lazy, hackneyed screenplay that cheats its audience emotionally. If you like Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon or Ed Harris, please see Erin Brokovich, Dead Man Walking and The Right Stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe.
0 ||| Predictible, sob-story melodrama with a girlfriend agenda to boot! I'm surprised that Sarandon went anywhere near this, it's such a boring Hollywood take on the mom vs. younger girlfriend scenerio. Should be understood that this screenplay was originally written by real-life stepmom Gigi Levangie. I think Gigi had an agenda to push. For once I'd like to see Hollywood come out with a film that sings the praises of original moms, not younger-model girlfriends, and makes these original moms the attractive, healthy, mentally-sound very cool and sexy women they often are in real life. Let's give them the happy ending--they make the world go round! If you like soap opera drama-rama or you're a younger stepmom/girlfriend who wants justification and wants to demean the original mom/wife (I'm not an original mom or first wife, BTW, just an annoyed viewer), you'll think this is a great film. Otherwise, this is one to skip.
0 ||| Stepmom (Chris Columbus, 1998) It's probably considered at least a venial sin in America to criticize Columbus, who's bookended his directorial career with two of the biggest blockbusters ever to hit a big screen, Home Alone and the Harry Potter franchise. But let's face it. Home Alone was pure unadulterated emotionally manipulative schlock. The guy's made his mark directing the kinds of teen comedies John Hughes wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole (and Hughes even wrote Home Alone. One wonders why he didn't direct...). With Stepmom, Columbus has all the schlock with none of the cuteness of the child actors. Not that said cuteness ever made his films watchable previously. There is only one actress in Hollywood who can make Julia Roberts look like she can act, and that is the detestable Susan Sarandon. While Sarandon has been nausea-inducing in a number of roles, this one goes above and beyond the call of duty. Sarandon's character, Jackie Harrison, is the ex-wife of hapless Luke (Ed Harris, showing once and for all that no matter how good an actor you are, if the script makes you look like an idiot, you will look like an idiot). She can't stand Luke's new girlfriend, Isabel (Roberts), and for that matter can't seem to stand much of anyone, including her own kids. Jackie is as loathsome a creature as the average viewer, and most non-average viewers, will ever want to meet. Were she male, she'd be on the Lifetime Movie network in a wifebeater T-shirt, throwing beer cans at the football game and smacking the kids around, and everyone would hate her. But she's female, and she's in a Chris Columbus movie, and so we're supposed to sympathize. (Oh, and to make sure we do, not far into the film she's diagnosed with cancer. Because that's an excuse to be [a jerk].) Julia Roberts has only managed one decent role in her career, and that (Flatliners) lay in the strength of the rest of the cast. The fact that she can be singled out here because of the weakness of the cast around her says volumes. I could easily go on for another half-hour about the painfully overdramatized script, the shameless attempts at emotional manipulation throughout, the pedestrian camerawork, and the fact that, even though he's working with adults, Chris Columbus is still directing teen feel-good-because-everyone-bonds movies. But there are so many more deserving things to give bad reviews to out there I can't justify spending any more time on this painfully bad piece of dreck. (zero)
0 ||| I hated this movie.  I lived the "stepmom" role.  I currently the "ex" and my son has to deal with his "stepmom".  Let's start with the fact that Susan Saradon's character is so far from unreal it is not funny.  She dotes on her kids to a fault, keeps up the 3 story Victorian house all by herself, is smart and funny.  So I guess the only reason her husband didn't want her anymore is because she grew older.  But at least they still can be friends.  Hell, he even went out and bought a lid of grass for her to help with the cancer treatment.  I hate the depiction of father is suppose to be spending time with the kids and they are being taken care of by the fiance'.  Dad has to go to work, well doesn't she?  She loses her job over his kids crisis?  The mom doesn't have any friends or relatives that the kids can go to while she is in treatment?  No, she has to go to the woman who lost her son while she was working on a photo shoot. Too silly for words.  Pass on this movie...unless you are looking for the fantasy of how to deal with a family that is not yours.  Also see the Brady Bunch....
1 ||| This is a terrible movie.  Not only is the acting quite pathetic, but the entire plot is dull and predictable.  This kind of movie has been done a thousaund times, and there are far better versions out there.  I felt sorry for those poor kids that had to play in this movie, so I gave it 2 stars.
0 ||| I have been wanting to view this movie for quite some time. What a disappointment! The only character that was marginally believable was Sarandon's as a mother battling the fears of losing her children to the trophy wife. The rest of the characters were very uninteresting. I think the screenwriter and director should have done better step-parenting research. It would have done them wonders to log on to any number of newsgroups to get a feel for what real step families go through. The characters in this movie weren't real. I was very disappointed. The rest of the movie was bland, boring, and frankly, unbelievable. I mean, what mother can afford to take a child out on a twilight horse ride on a moments notice? And where, pray tell, is this fantastic New York suburb Sarandon lived in that afforded her pastoral views of mountains and woods? Did anyone miss the fact the Roberts worked in NYC and was mysteriously able to pick-up the stepkids at their birthday parties and schools in this lush suburb? Sorry, I grew up in that area of the East Coast and I'm still guessing where this suburb is. Find something better to do with 2 hours. If your really want to watch an excellent movie about the horrors and nuances of divorce see 1982's "Shoot The Moon" with Albert Finney and Diane Keaton. Now that was a good movie.
2 ||| A nice but tired story. But, how much more interesting it would have been if Lynn Whitfield had played Julia Robert's part with an otherwise unchanged cast. In addition, Lynn Whitfield is a far better actress than Julia Roberts. Of course this is a no-no in racist USA.
2 ||| STEPMOM, to me, is a very touching, moving, and hilarious movie. I didn't laugh out loud, though. I laughed on the inside. The one person I really couldn't stand at times was Anna (Jena Malone). This was because of her attitude and the way she treated Isabel (Julia Roberts) most of the time. One of my favorite quotes of this movie is, "Anna! You DO NOT run out on your mother!" I was moved when Jackie (Susan Sarandon) said, "Oh, sweetie, it's okay to miss me." I thought everyone in the movie gave a very moving performance. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to anyone who's a fan of Julia Roberts.
2 ||| Before I start describing how good the movie was, I want to stop at both actors Julia Roberts and Ed Harris. If they are put in a silent movie, of no words and not even subtitles, they can make the film emotionally rich just by their facial expressions! I mean, you easily fall in love with those two actors because of their emotional faces and eyes. The is a light movie, that all family can enjoy watching together. It's based on emotional conflict between a family with two kids and a stepmom (Julia Roberts). In this movie you'll enjoy the emotional driven laughs and tears all the way until the end. One of the things that you'll enjoy most in this film is that you'll enjoy your life better and appreciate more many things in your life that you have taken for granted. THIS IS A MUST SEE FOR ALL FANS of Julia Roberts and Ed Harris. And if you loved this movie you'll love more Julia Roberts' movie "My Best Friend Wedding".
1 ||| Way, way, way too overemotional and contrived. Ed Harris wants to marry his girlfriend, Julia Roberts. But his kids from his previous marriage to Susan Sarandon don't like her, and Susan Sarandon hates her. So naturally she has to win them all over... and of course tragedy has to happen, so Susan is stricken with cancer and will be out of the picture soon enough. Yes, there are some winning moments here. It would be difficult to have a film with all these well known and often brilliant actors without having some really great moments. But overall this is not a thrilling or interesting film.
1 ||| Oh for Lord's sakes.  I can love a drama, but not when it hits all my hated M's -- Maudlin, Morose and Morbid. This overwraught sobfest features  Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts as mom and stepmom respectively, working  together to build a stable environment for the kids under trying  circumstances (illness, kids' hostility towards Julia, Julia's busy career,  a dad/husband who raises his voice, but can't lift a finger).  While the  premise is admirable, the result is lots of overacting and overreacting  from the usually watchable Sarandon and Roberts.  This is not a reason to  spend your money -- a renter at most, if ever I saw one.
2 ||| Ok, I rented this because I figured my girlfriend would like it, but so did I. Michelle Pfeiffer is her most riveting. I normally don't like Treat Williams, but I found his character very beleivable here. Also the young  man who played Vincent (17 yr. old) will do well to keep acting, he has a  road ahead of him. I know it sounds like a movie-of-the-week plot, but it  is quite effective. The DVD itself has a short (5 min) featurette, that is  about as enlightening as it sounds.
2 ||| This is the first movie where Tom Hanks really began to show his depth. It was a film that required him to open with the comedic chops he's honed so well but then, because of the deepening of the film's story from comedy to drama, requested so much more of him. He ultimately delivers in spades.  This is really a story about a son moving very fast in the fast lane of advertising. He's a pro and he loves what he does. He's also a personality that lives on charm and in the moment.  But when his parents separate after years of marriage, his life changes rapidly from no personal responsibilities to a multitude of them. It's also begs a question that rarely gets told well- how do sons and daughters deal with parents as life turns the tables and we suddenly start having to deal with listening to and taking care of them? The changing of roles and responsibilities. As the film unfolds, it presents those concerns with proper weight, depth, sadness, growth and understanding.  Gary Marshall directed the film prior to his mega hit with Pretty Woman but I really think this is the better film of the two. He draws the best from Jackie Gleason, Eva Marie Saint and Beth Armstrong and Hector Alonzo- each lending a real ensemble cast feeling to the piece and although Tom Hanks shines- so do they.  Jackie Gleason deserves special mention because he really plays a rather hard, sad man at the end of the road as a clothing salesman, and he digs deep, never lending anything false to how this man thinks, feels and operates. The exchanges between him and Hanks about how he was raised lend a real truth to the role.  If you're looking for a film that has some humor and some depth of feeling in the same breath, this is an interesting evening's viewing.  An underrated film that deserves a second look and a larger audience.
2 ||| Tom Hanks plays an successful advertising agent. His life is running smoothly until his mother leaves his father. Then his dad loses his job. He's trying to help both out but his relationship with his dad is rocky. Family problems start to effect his work. It's about how Hank's character handles this new development and also the the relationships of the two women in his life. One, the daughter of the owner of the airline and the other an childhood sweetheart he's still friends with.  This movie started out slow so I'm thinking I'm going to be disappointed. Finally, the story picks up and it gets interesting. I think with better editing this could have been a very good movie instead of just okay.
2 ||| Tom Hanks is the young yuppie in Chicago who is a big hot-shot ad man, and Jackie Gleason (in his last screen role) is his father who has just lost his meager job and is facing divorce. Gleason comes across as most unlovable, and the conflict between Hanks and him produces quite a bit of noise. The selfish Hanks has to make some sacrifices for his father, as expected--there's the message. The movie tries to do too much, though, and not much of it in any depth. It's all surface.
2 ||| I knew right from the first scene there was little possibility of overcoming Tom Hanks' stilted "too cool for school" impression of Bruce Willis and Chevy Chase.  Unfortunately, Jackie Gleason never has any dialogue that could have possibly challenged him or stretched him as an actor.  The only reasons I can even give it three stars is that the supporting actors all fare a little bit better and the attempt to show family being more important than career hits it's bullseye.  If you try to overlook it's obvious cliches, there is a lot of warmth around the edges that makes it worth watching once.
1 ||| This movie is not credible on a psychological level. Sam/Ben was too well-adjusted, too articulate, and too mature for his age. Any kid in real life would not be expected to abruptly pack his bag and leave his home behind. He would not have been able to psychologically heal--never mind forgive--his older brother. It would have taken years of therapy for the family to come together as a family. Basically, this is an escapist, feel-good movie with competent enough acting.
0 ||| TITLE IS CORRECT.  NOTHING  IN  COMMON.
0 ||| Too depressing.  The only one of Tom Hanks' movies I didn't care for.
0 ||| Pitiful!
1 ||| Not very good
2 ||| I love Michelle Pfeiffer and she was amazing in this movie, but this movie could have been so much better. The story was slow and boring, and very sad from beginning to end.  Beth has three small children. Her three year old son (her middle child) is kidnapped. She can't handle the loss and can't move on. She neglects the two children that she still has. Her marriage suffers.  I could feel Beth's pain at the loss of her child, but I felt more of her guilt over him being kidnapped right under her nose (which really could have happened to anyone, so she was way too hard on herself).  SPOILER ALERT..  The three year old, Ben, is never found by Whoopi Goldberg and the experts who were working for years to find him. Instead, as a twelve year old, he actually walks up to the family's door and just rings the bell. He had no idea that this was his real family.  He was simply going door to door, looking for work mowing lawns. This kidnapped child remained in the same neighborhood all along, and later, both the older brother and younger sister admit that they had seen him around, many times.  Absolutely every character in this movie is miserable. The irony is that Ben was the only character who was happy, that is, until his real family wants to take him back and away from the only life that he knows, and then, Ben becomes just as miserable as everyone else.  Ben was kidnapped by a woman who was an old acquaintance of Beth's, a woman who was aching for the death of her own child, and so she kidnapped Ben to replace her own three year old boy. The woman died, and so Ben was raised by the woman's second husband, who had no idea that Ben was not his wife's biological child. This stepfather described Ben as the happiest child that he had ever known, until it came out that he had been kidnapped, and then he became the saddest child that he had ever known. For me, the most heartbreaking part of this movie was when the stepfather said this.  Ben is reunited with his real family, but everyone stays miserable. Beth is thrilled to get her son back, but her joy does not last when she realizes that her son does not remember her and does not accept her. The real father is relieved to have his son back, but he is also hurting and angry that Ben feels like the stepfather is his real father. The older brother never wanted Ben back and has a lot of his own guilt and resentments toward Ben. The little sister was only a baby when Ben was kidnapped, and so she is still too young to really understand what has been going on.  At the end, the family must admit that Ben needs to be with the stepfather, and they reluctantly send him back. So, this movie begins with the sadness of the kidnapping and remains sad all the way through to the end.

2 ||| I am a big fan of Mr. Hanks and I am old enough to have watched and enjoyed many hours of "The great one" on television.  Both are very talented in their own ways.  I had not seen this film till today.  Not even sure why I suddenly wanted to watch it.  This is early in Hanks career and the semi-manic, rapid fire manner in which he juggles his way through a scene is already firmly in his grasp.  He is fun to watch.  The script is where I would prefer to focus my criticism because the actors were all quite fine.  There are other write-ups that will identify this as one of the best father - son relationship movies, ever.  I would hardly cast my vote that way.  For example, one of the most scorched earth movies that is everything that this film is not, "Affliction" with Nick Nolte and the late James Coburn is a smouldering, simmering volcanic dynamo.  "Nothing in common" by comparison is way too kosher, safe and aimed for middle America, taking very few risks and staying rather formulaic.  The comparison I draw might be unfair because there are many other father son movies and plays that far outshine this film.  For example "Death of a salesman", perhaps the greatest of them all, is an invitation to examine the dark side of family traffic.  Nothing in Common, watched now in 2014, seems by comparison to be a product of its time.  It suffers from not taking the emotional risks that real families in deep distress actually live through.  Gleason was robbed all his life of enough dramatic roles.  While a wonderful television icon he excelled in the very few really meaty dramatic roles and sadly we got to see too little of that.  In this film he is not given enough room to stretch his personality beyond the crabby old and sick man that he has become.  His character is not allowed to share the grief he continues to bottle up.  You spend a few minutes watching the interactions in "Affliction" and you can see what better scripts and raw gestalt can do for dramatic effect.  I think that this film suffers from trying to be two things at once: a very light comedy and a light weight drama.  It would have been better served, in my view, by sticking with one version and strengthening the focus.  These were actors who could perform, all of them and its a shame that they were not allowed to show the pains of family stresses in a more forthright manner.  I don't want to say that the film has aged badly.  It is a product of a Hollywood system that pushes product downstream into the market and cares much less about making bold statements.  By the reckoning of my own tastes, I enjoy a more visceral drama, one in which there is danger lurking beneath the rising blood pressure.  Will something suppressed, something urgent finally be said?  In fairness the strength of the film is in the last 20 minutes where the dramatic heat comes as close to a boil as the script allows.  I found myself sitting quietly and barely moved at all throughout the viewing.  It is a tepid affair and I would not recommend it too much, especially in light of what Tom Hanks went on to.  I needed to see something more substantial here;  perhaps I had nothing in common with the film?
2 ||| Looks of good actors and compelling stories.  I do get tired of this stereotype that young female professionals are heartless and lacking in empathy, and too full of ambition.  Overall, a good story, even though dated by the 1980's clothing styles and hair - yuk!  Did we really look like that back then? Probably so...
2 ||| Jackie Gleason, in his final film role, plays the icy, stonewalling father of a hyperactive, professional Tom Hanks. There's a good message at the core of this one, about the impenetrable veneer expected of men from his generation and the dire effects it bore on those around him. Hanks, a smooth-talking corporate '80s ad exec, and Gleason, a foot-to-pavement salesman struggling to deal with the end of his career, manage well with the heavy stuff while occasionally injecting a few welcome dashes of humor and sarcasm to the mix. The film is flawed, though, in its unbridled lack of restraint. Every last supporting character hints at a big, convoluted back story and many of them are halfheartedly explored. That diverts attention away from the key players and leaves us with what seems like one big, fuzzy, unfocused batch of incomplete or unfulfilling arcs. There's simply too much to keep track of, and too much time wasted with characters we don't care about. Noteworthy as the stage where Hanks showed he could be more than just a comic player, but otherwise it's too overstuffed and vague to recommend.
0 ||| This movie will not play in the USA without region 2 converting capability dvd player. It wouldn't even play on my laptop. I was so disappointed because I love love this movie and wanted to watch it immediately, but it wouldn't work and I you tubed the problem and then realized I wouldn't be able to watch it without buying computer software. I don't remember seller mentioning a caution of this nature at all and it frustrated me to have to return it, pay for stamps to return in original package, print label to put inside and then turn around and order another one that will play right, because this movie is just that good. It touched my heart the very first time I saw it and I've remembered it ever since. Just make sure you buy it from a better seller.
2 ||| I was pretty worried going into Nothing In Common earlier tonight.  I seem to be a VERY picky person when it comes to Tom Hank films.  Besides Forest Gump, I mostly only like his ultra serious films, such as Saving Private Ryan and a few others that escape my mind at the moment.  I still believe Tom Hanks hit the high point in his career around 10 years ago.  He didn't exactly start out as an incredible movie star.  It took him a long time to get going and win over movie watchers.  However, Nothing In Common turned out to be good.  Not GREAT by any stretch of the imagination- just barely good enough that I recommend sticking through the first hour of useless storytelling in order to get to the good stuff (the good being Tom Hanks' characters relationship with his father).  The first hour of Nothing In Comming features nothing but Hanks' character trying to sleep with a few different women, and he ends up succeeding.  I guess these moments are supposed to qualify as humor, or romantic-style humor, but for me it doesn't exactly work because there's no interesting storyline development while this is going on.  Some of the other characters he communicates with is rather unexceptional and pointless to include in the story as well.  Makes me wonder what movie writers were thinking back then.  The film is also SEVERELY dated.  It's definitely stuck in the mid 80's, right down to the ugly predictable pacing and the wimpy music that's supposed to pass the test as "beautiful" and "fitting the mood".  Prepare yourself for a huge smack of the 80's right in your face as far as the soundtrack and presentation is concerned.  At least the relationship between Tom Hanks' character and his father actually got good starting around the halfway point, otherwise this would have easily been a 1-star forgettable (and laughable) movie for Tom Hanks.  He moved on to *much* better things later on.
2 ||| Boring Movie.
2 ||| Oh gosh. If you like LMN, you will love this movie. It's pretty sappy. So many things that are stupid or unbelievable. Also, just bad writing.  1. Characters are one-dimensional. Mom is hysterical and emotional woman. Dad is stoic and emotionless man. Vincent is a mean and evil child from the very beginning. Sam/Ben is the "good boy."  2. Movie depends upon really unrealistic coincidences.  3. Movie rushes to a forced "happy ending."  4. Movie was odd in how it approached the kidnapped boy's adoptive father. There was no effort to come up with a creative parenting scheme -- like shared custody. Instead, everything was either/or. Unrealistic and simple.
1 ||| a mostly bad story with plenty of frustration. First off. what mother would ever think of taking three kids to a class reunion, especialy a baby? After "Ben" disappears and the remaining family structure falls apart the lead charecter turns to "super cop" Whoopi for counciling, ya right.  don't bother with this one.
2 ||| "The Deep End of the Ocean" is based on Jacquelyn Mitchard's best-selling novel. It's the story of a busy mother, Beth Cappadora (Michelle Pfeiffer), whose son Ben is kidnapped at the age of three. Nine years later, Ben is found and is reunited with his family, but he doesn't have much interest in getting to know them and is resentful about being yanked out of his old life.  I enjoyed this movie. It's pretty true to the novel, and the few things that were changed for the film aren't all that important. I think the biggest difference between the book and the movie is that the character of Beth is much more toned-down and sympathetic on the big screen than she is on paper. Mitchard's version of the character is more interesting and complex, but I can see why the producers probably thought it wouldn't do well on the big screen. Pfeiffer delivers a strong performance, as does Jonathan Jackson, who plays the oldest Cappadora son, Vincent. The only casting decision that left me puzzled is Whoopi Goldberg, who is probably the last person on earth I would have picked to play Detective Candy Bliss, but oh well.  Bottom line: This is a good, solid film. Not great, but very good. The story is about as unrealistic as you can get and I think the ending is way too optimistic, but stranger things have been known to happen in this world.
1 ||| Pfeiffer plays a mother who is devastated when her son goes AWOL in a crowd. Nine years later he returns - but is he her real son? Unbelievable coincidences apart, Deep End of the Ocean tries too hard to be faithful to Jacquelyn Mitchard's best-selling source material and winds up falling between more stools than a wino at a Scatologists convention. Pfeiffer, as always, glows.
2 ||| One of the fringe benefits of a major format change is the inevitable markdowns of old stock of the old format.  I've been taking advantage of the VHS sales in local video stores for quite a while now.  Many of them are dirt cheap, and if you still have a functional VCR and don't demand all the "extras" of the DVD format, you can find all kinds of bargains.  And all kinds of dross too, unfortunately.  I purchased this movie recently, along with several other films starring Michelle Pfeiffer and was contemplating holding my own personal "Pfeiffer Film Festival," but for better or for worse, I started out with DEEP END OF THE OCEAN and that pretty much nipped those plans in the bud.  I wound up shelving the other entries in the Pfeiffer filmography for another rainy day.  This one was just too depressing.  And I don't mean the content.  I think most people recognize that Michelle Pfeiffer is a talented actress as well as being a very beautiful woman.  But like many good actresses, she seems to wind up in mediocre film after mediocre film.  Maybe it was ever thus.  How many truly great films did a Katharine Hepburn or a Bette Davis really do in their day.  And Liz Taylor did clunker after clunker in the late 60s and early 70s.  But there was a significant change in recent decades.  Even our biggest stars of today don't carry films the way they once did.  No one goes to see a Michelle Pfeiffer film just because Michelle Pfeiffer is in it these days.  The pressure is on, then, for an actor to pick vehicles worthy of his or her talents.  A number of the reviews I've seen posted here and elsewhere have elaborated on THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN's storyline, so I won't belabor that here.  Suffice to say that the story of a child's kidnapping and the subsequent emotional trauma it inflicts on an entire family is a potentially powerful one.  Pfeiffer heads a strong cast, including Treat Williams as her equally grieving but more resilient husband.  They all have good moments and make the most of their screentime, but the story never quite gels.  And it doesn't get much better when after ten years, the family is abruptly reunited with their lost son.  The fact that the reunion is highly unlikely is not so much the problem.  I'm not out to revoke anyone's dramatic license here.  What makes no dramatic sense or even common sense is the family's handling of the situation.  In the Age of Oprah, how come no one even considers any kind of counseling for ANYONE in the family.  Many people (and many entire families, of course) are resistant to seeking psychological help, but under such extraordinary circumstances, it's hard to imagine this family not even considering the option.  If not for themselves, how about for the boy?  After all he's been through, even the proudest of families should feel little compunction about his receiving professional help.  Like many other reviewers who have not read Jacquelyn Michaud's acclaimed novel upon which this film is based, I am guessing that this is likely one more case in which the "book was better."  A novel, of course, can indulge in more leisurely pacing, and provide more background and, most importantly, can utilize techniques like interior monologue which contemporary cinema rightly eschews.  (Voiceovers don't cut it--and never did).  I wonder too if the book might not have provided us with some kind of explanation for the evocative title.  There seems to be a trend toward a kind of emotional topography in recent fiction and cinema (not only "deep ends of the ocean" but also "maps of the world" and of "the human heart").  Apparently, they mean something.  The book may make it clear.  The movie doesn't really bother.
0 ||| Michelle Pfeiffer fails to convince me of her grief at losing her son to a kidnapper. She seems guilty about losing sight of him momentarily and for letting him get lost. Her guilt overtakes everything, and she is not a very devoted mother to her other two children. You can see that they are suffering from her neglect and total self-absorption. I felt that the movie was supposed to have been very compelling on an emotional, almost primal, level, but it was not compelling at all. I imagine that the book did a better job of conveying the terror of losing your child and realizing that your child may be gone forever. The people in the film all seemed to be too obsessed with themselves. Naturally this kind of tragedy will cause introspection and times of real doubt and soul searching, but I did not get the sense that the people here had any level of depth or sincerity.
2 ||| This is a different type movie.  On purpose.  It is Arnold Schwarzennegger mocking himself as an action hero.  I actually think this is one of his best movies.  It has plenty of action, humor cameos a little bit of everything.  And it's entertaining and a good way to kill two hours.
2 ||| GOOD
1 ||| The story begins with Beth Cappadora going to her High School Reunion in  Chicago.  For some reason, she brings all her kids and leaves her husband  behind.  However, a tragedy strikes when she leaves the older boy (Vincent)  to watch the younger one (Ben) and he goes missing.  He goes missing for 10  years. Much of the movie involves the consequences of such an action  immediately after the abduction as well as the scars that it leaves even 10  years later.  Vincent, who is not like 17, has become a hardened teen,  partly because of his guilt for letting Ben go and partly because his  mother stopped doing her job as a parent for so many years.  The  wife/husband relationship is also strained but is on the mend as Ben (now  called Sam) comes back into their lives. However, Ben/Sam is not happy  to be back.  He has been living a quiet, happy life with the only parent he  ever knew, his father.  To be stripped of his father because of something  the now deceased mother did is also a tragedy in itself.  Who are the  parents here?  The Cappadora who raised him to age 3 and are the biological  parents or George Karras who raised Ben/Sam for the remaining 10 years and  is the only parent that Ben/Sam ever knew? Well these questions are not  really answered in this melodrama because Ben/Sam becomes less the focus of  the story.  Actually the director goes all over the place patching up story  leaks with quaint little fixes that are reminiscent of Sit coms.  I felt  this plotline belonged more on "Growing Pains" than on the silver  screen.  The worst part of the movie comes at the end when George suddenly  lets Ben/Sam go "home" and Ben/Sam suddenly feels that the  Cappadora's are his real family.  This is after Beth lets him go and  Vincent is a real jerk to him.  It is a cop-out ending IMO. If you want  drama, there are others that are better than this formulaic  timewaster....Rating: C-
2 ||| A child was missing. Beth's guilty almost damage her marriage, abandon her  career and neglect other children. Finally she get over it and luckily to  find her boy after 9 years. It was supposed to be a humanity and very  touching drama. The biological family want him back, I can feel it. But  they don't have to cut him off from George. The good man adopted Sam and  brought him up as his own. Have some empathy, the kid love him. He's a  friend not an enemy. Why don't they try negotiate to share Sam's custody, 3  days a week or something, be friends with George. They all live in the same  community after all. For they treat George so mean, I don't feel the  story convincible.
1 ||| Like far too many films these days, "The Deep End of the Ocean" begins promisingly then collapses midway under the crushing weight of heavyhanded plot mechanics, incredibility and sentimentality. The premise  of the story is so compelling that the audience can't help but be drawn  emotionally into the intense plight facing this family. Michelle  Pfeiffer portrays a young photographer, living an idyllic life in Madison,  Wisconsin with a loving and devoted husband (Treat Williams) and three  adorable young children. While in Chicago for a class reunion, every  parent's ultimate nightmare becomes a reality: her middle child  unaccountably disappears in the middle of a crowded hotel lobby. These  scenes, in which she undergoes a sense of mounting panic as well as a  crushing sense of guilt and personal self-doubt, are more terrifying than  anything contained in a conventional "horror" film. We cringe too  as the investigators come up against one blank wall after another,  empathizing fully with a mother driven to desperation in the face of the  unspeakable. As months pass, the family attempts to cope with the  horrific reality of their situation and the film promises to become an  insightful study of the effects of the loss, fear and guilt that  accompanies the disappearance of a child. But then the film goes agley as  it moves ahead a decade and the child is miraculously discovered living a  mere few blocks away, happily ensconced with a man first thought to be a  kidnapper then revealed as an innocent pawn in an abduction scheme gone  awry. As the child moves in with his "true" parents, the  screenplay settles into a bland T.V. movie formula, in which each character  must act out his or her customary little drama with little heed given to  believability or originality. Instead of exploring the various stages a  family goes through in the wake of a devastating loss, the film cheats us  by coming through with an unconvincingly upbeat resolution. It becomes  quite clear that the filmmakers are far more concerned with jerking out  tears than with providing a truly thoughtprovoking exploration of its  theme. This is a shame because the actors (especially Pfeiffer) handle  their roles admirably. Only Whoopi Goldberg, in a totally thankless role as  a compassionate investigator of missing children, seems hopelessly miscast.  This film might well have been a labor of love for her (and indeed for  everyone involved), but for the audience, it only makes one sigh over how  much better it might have been.
2 ||| Classic Arnold
2 ||| I love this movie.  I know, it is silly; but, I love it anyway.  My only negative would be that it appears to be DVD quality, not 1080 HD.  Maybe that is because of of low-budget filming.  Or, maybe we were tricked.  I am considering returning it.
2 ||| Bit rate for video is decent. 23-30Mbps. The movie is very grainy and some dark scenes are poor in quality. The audio track is laughable for Blu Ray. Bitrate is 448Kbps. The usual bit rate for audio is usually near 5000kbps. If it had cost me more than $5 I would have been mad. This is  a cheap transfer of the movie. The company supporting this release is Mill Creek Entertainment and clearly they have something to do with this poor rip.
1 ||| the cast in this movie is trying to make this movie dramatic and touching but is wasted with bad acting and cheesiness. Michelle Pfeiffer could have done a lot better. Whoopi Goldberg was kinda good in this
2 ||| This movie is two movies really, and that is why it may appear longer than what it is. The first half deals with the loss of a child at a school reunion. The child does not reappear, and the way the family deal with it  is extremely well done.  Pfeiffer portrays the mother who never gets over  the grief extremely well.  The second half of the movie deals with the  family moving to Chicago, and by an amazing twist of fate, stumble across  their son. Naturally it is NOT all roses from here on.  The son is taken  out of the home he is used to, told that he was kidnapped and expected to  fit in to his new family. By this time, I was very sad as I just wanted it  to come together nicely for the family. For awhile the movie seeed to drag,  but it was still watchable.  Fine performances from Treat Williams as the  father who expects everything to fall into place, and as mentioned above, a  great performance from Michelle Pfeiffer as the mother who has to endure so  much pain. I agree with others, it seems like a telemovie only because many  telemovies focus on similar family themes. The movie will promise you this  though: in the blink of an eye, your whole life can change.
2 ||| I like this movie I think evrey one in this movie dose a grate job. But I would day this movie is worth a chance to watch it a couple of time but I would not say it is worth anuff money to buy.
2 ||| DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE ! THE CHILD THEY LOST 10 YEARS AGO ; NOW LEAVES JUST 2 BLOCKS AWAY FROM HIS PARENTS !  THE END .... DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE TOO... MICHELLE PFEIFFER'S PERFORMANCE IS WORTH IT THOUGH
0 ||| worst direction
0 ||| This review is on the quality of the high-definition print. As I wrote before on other bad quality Blu-rays, this is one of those you should avoid. They did not re-digitize from the analog film, to get additional pixels for HD, and then print HD in real 2K resolution. They made a copy of the previous standard 1K definition DVD print, but it **doesn't have the additional 1K pixels**. So you think you're watching HD content, but you don't. The same visible grain all over the screen as on DVD, the same resolution level of close-up detail. Shame Columbia Pics, otherwise venerable company. However, they made a step forward and printed it in wide screen (previous DVD version was shamefully full screen). For this reason I'll keep it. If you're looking to upgrade your Last Action Hero DVD to HD, I do not recommend this buy as it won't give you the expected quality.
2 ||| Arnold Schwarzenegger and Austin O'Brien star in this 1993 action-fantasy. This features a young boy who is given a magic ticket allowing him to go into the movie world where he meets his action icon. I saw this when it first came out and it's not bad. Arnold is great usual and also plays himself. The film also pokes fun and pays tribute to action films. Charles Dance, Anthony Quinn, Tom Noonan and others also appear. This blu-ray has good picture and sound, but no features. I still recommend this.
2 ||| The idea was good but the acting-especially the children actor- is so very bad. Also the transformation from the real world and the screen world is unbelievable,  It was not a good film when i first watched and it was not a good film when I watched again with the cheap bluray verison that I bought.
2 ||| not quite as good as we had remembered it to be.
2 ||| Excellent service!!!!!  Some of these old Schwarzenegger film are a kick!!!
1 ||| Has some good laughs, but mostly pretty stoopid.  Even my 13-year-old, who loves Arnold, only felt like watching the first half.  Notable for debuting Bridgette Wilson, who was so memorable in Shopgirl among other movies.
2 ||| No a bad movie, just not as good as Arnold's action movies.
1 ||| Arnold seems flat in this film
2 ||| This is a review of the 2014 Blu-ray release.  I never understood why this movie didn't do better.  Perhaps because it didn't take itself seriously - it is, after all, an Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie mocking Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies - so maybe we feel like we shouldn't take it seriously either.  Arnold by this time had well established himself as an action hero, indeed THE action hero to many.  But he had also starred in several successful comedies, such as Twins and Kindergarten Cop.  And while there is plenty of action in this movie, it is more a comedy than an action movie.  It is surprisingly (and refreshingly) self-aware in its analysis of the fictional reflection of our real world that exists only in the movies - sort of a modern-day Alice Through the Looking Glass.  Whether mocking that there are no ordinary-looking women in the movies, only gorgeous models; or the impossibility that all phone numbers begin with "555", this movie asks us to examine the holes in the fictional reality we are fed in the movie theater, rather than overlook them.  It is not often that we get a refreshingly honest script as this.  Unfortunately, this Blu-ray presentation leaves something to be desired.  The transfer is a bit soft, with weak blacks, and even some fuzzy blurring to the edge of the image in at least one scene (the last projection booth scene).  There are ZERO extras, (not even a trailer), and the menu consists of one choice - "Play Movie".  No soundtrack or subtitle options.  Obviously Columbia has not shown the love to this movie.  So, much as I regret it, this Blu-ray only gets 3 stars, due to the quality of the transfer.  However, don't let that dissuade you.  This really is a gem of a movie.
1 ||| pretty bad stuff
0 ||| Last Action Hero is probably Arnold's worst movie. I would recommend most of his other films, not this one.
2 ||| movie is much better than the reviews. the blu ray quality is poor. not any better than dvd.
0 ||| I don't hate this movie title but I hate the company who produce it. It is Mill Creek Entertainment. They almost removed all of the closed-captioning or English Subtitling features on DVD. I do not understand why the original DVDs companies have it and sell off to Mill Creek Entertainment by reducing some of the important features. Even they don't add booklet inside (chapters/information). Whole thing is sucks! Try purchase original DVD of this title from Columbia/Tristar DVD if available out there.
2 ||| This film may be a tribute to all things action in Hollywood, but there were some other things worth enjoying.  Right from the start, I wish that there had been more of Danny Devito as the cartoon cat, but that may just be because I'm a Danny Devito fan...Arnold just doesn't do it for me.  The ridiculous nature of the "action movie" was quite enjoyable (sadly, action movies in our world aren't that far off) and the villain, played by Charles Dance, didn't quite stray into an area that I like to refer to as "stereotypical creepy".  I enjoyed the satirical elements of this film, though I stop and wonder how the makers of real action films come up with some of their stuff.  I mean, I thought all the satire was right on the money, so have action movies really strayed so much?  Anyway, I found the leading lad, Austin O'Brien, okay, though he seemed to stray from whining to annoyingly over-confident the whole time, neither of which are appealing traits for me.  I actually found Robert Prosky as the theatre attendant more interesting...Danny Devito still wins though.  Overall, this was the perfect film for Arnold Schwarzenegger as it basically poked fun at what he did best while allowing him to continue doing it.  It's good for a laugh, especially at the action movies it's making fun of.  Enjoy.
2 ||| I really like Arnold S. I got this on time and all, but I did not quite like it as much as I thought I would.  Perhaps I need to watch it again...
2 ||| what can I say, it`s good and some bad in it but its one you don`t mind watching over again
0 ||| Is anyone else having troubles with their prime streaming?  I use a Roku and Netflix works almost flawlessly.  Amazon Prime, however, completely bugs out whenever I try to pause and replay a movie.
0 ||| I've only walked out on 5 movies in an actual theater: Born in East L.A., Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Valentine and The Last Action Hero... Even though I've not changed my opinions about the former films, I thought I'd give LAH one more try.... I was unfortunate enough to find a DVD copy in the horrid & worthless pan & scan format.. albeit, it was only $1... Turned it off after 2 minutes in.. You know, had this been a 1.85:1 film & it was "full Screen", I could have worked with that and adjusted my HDTV to make it 1.85:1, but this is not the case with this film & most of the DVD's that Sony now releases in the 1.33 ratio...  The fact that any company this late in the home entertainment game would release a 2.35:1 film in a lousy 1:33 ratio is not only insulting and reckless, it shows incompetent individuals are making key decisions at the studios and they deserve to lose money.. This is yet another DVD from Sony which is worthless, and anyone who cares about movies and this film should avoid this version..... Oh, and I finally found an original '97 DVD release of LAH when released in both P&S & Widescreen on the same disc.. Got it for another $1, & yup, after all of these years, it still sucks... even for just $1.
2 ||| Considered to be one of the biggest summer disappointments of 1993, Last Action Hero tried to get its name out there by being the next big name action flick, and it sure did disappoint many. Here's a thing to keep in mind though: this is actually a PARODY of the action genre that just happens to have Arnold Schwarzenegger in it. It's not trying to be a replica of the big names such as Terminator, Predator, or even Commando (which was unintentionally hilarious, by the way). Instead, it's an inside joke in the style of a sketch comedy skit, except it's drawn out much longer. While I personally don't think that Last Action Hero is terrible by any means, it doesn't mean that's it flawless.  Arnold manages to play two characters in this film: the far more present cinematic world character Jack Slater, and the real life version of himself. He is obviously the reason why you would want to see this movie, and throughout the film, he makes fun of his stereotypical character by using over-the-top one liners and using unorthodox methods of action scenes. There's some hilarious jokes that he says throughout, and along with him, we even manage to see other film icons playing some of their trademark parts, including Robert Patrick dressed up as the T-1000, Sharon Stone's role as Catherine Tramell, and one of my personal favorites, Sylvester Stallone as The Terminator on a cardboard cutout. While I do enjoy the comedic, over-the-top bits that obviously point out the Hollywood cliches, this film suffers from drawing these out too long amongst its script. Sometimes they tend to be unnecessary and at others rather boring.  Also, I found the child protagonist played by Austin O'Brien to be rather annoying. Part of me thinks that they used the idea of him teaming up with Schwarzy from T2, where Edward Furlong was the child protagonist. While Furlong was clever, funny and acted well, O'Brien tries too hard to be a mastermind behind the typical action film. I understand that the role of a child was necessary for this to work, seeing how he managed to magically appear in the movie with his favorite action hero, but it could have been done far better with someone that could pull it off in a far less annoying fashion.  In a way, I tend to find Last Action Hero to be an enjoyable popcorn flick that tried something new by being a hidden parody. It was a major risk for director John McTiernan, screenwriter Shane Black (who ironically rewrote the script despite Zak Penn and Adam Leff having it a tongue-in-cheek reference to Black's style), and Arnold, but as a parody, it works. It's just a far cry from what we would expect from a cast like aforementioned.
0 ||| This film is a seventh-rate Terminator wannabe. The acting is secord-rate & over the top mainly with Lieutenant Dekker. The action scences are quite decent at best .The celebrity cameos are pointless. Some jokes were funny but not all of them. Not to metion,the lack of realism in the film's "real world" segment. I give this film a 2 and a half out of 10.
2 ||| A year after Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Terminator 2: Judgment Day", in 1993, he followed up with the summer action film "Last Action Hero".  The film was directed by John McTiernan ("Die Hard: With a Vengeance", "The 13th Warrior", "The Thomas Crown Affair") and a screenplay by Shane Black ("Lethal Weapon" films, "The Monster Squad", "The Last Boy Scout") and David Arnot ("The Adventures of Ford Fairlane").  The film featured cinematography by Dean Semler ("Bruce Almighty", "The Alamo", "The Longest Yard", "2012') and music by Michael Kamen ("X-Men", "Band of Brothers", "Frequency)".  An expensive film which cost around $85 million, the film was literally a spoof on action films and would feature cameos from many stars around that time.  From Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ian McKellen, Tina Turner, Robert Patrick and many more.  The film revolves around a boy named Danny Madigan (played by Austin O'Brien) who is a big fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger action films, especially his character Jack Slater.  The problem with Danny is that he rarely goes to school and it's become a problem since he spends his time watching movies and his mother covers up for him.  With the release of "Jack Slater IV", his friend Nick (played by Robert Prosky) who runs a very old rundown movie theater that is not doing so well, Jack gives him a sneak preview to catch the movie.  Nick also talks about how he was given a gold-ticket by Harry Houdini but never used it.  Nick tears the ticket in half and gives Danny the other half and as Danny is getting involved and enjoying the film, the ticket starts to magically work and next thing you know, Danny is inside the film for "Jack Slater IV" and in this world, things work like the movies and not real life.  As the film progresses and Danny sticks with Jack Slater and the two take on the bad guys which include the evil Englishman Benedict (played by Charles Dance).  But somehow along the way, Benedict steals Danny's ticket and has now cross over to the real world where Danny has come from.  In the real world, Benedict starts to learn that bad guys can win and starts killing people and noticing that the police are not there to stop him.  So, Benedict comes up with an idea to stop Jack Slater and that is by killing off the real actor that plays him...Arnold Schwarznegger.  Can Jack Slater and Danny stop Benedict in time?  VIDEO & AUDIO:  "Last Action Hero" is featured in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has given this film a pretty good treatment as they have with "Cliffhanger" and "Air Force One" in which they kept the film as close to what we see on the big screen, including the fine layer of grain.  For a film that is 17-years-old, the film looks good for its age and because there is so much happening throughout the film.  For example, in Danny's world, you can see how run down the theater is, old-style seats and everything is dark and there aren't any vibrant colors.  Until he goes into Jack Slater's world, then colors are vibrant and much better visuals.  Definitely a major improvement from the 2003 DVD of "Last Action Hero".  Now, where this film shines is with its lossless audio soundtrack.  Featured in English, French, Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1, one thing that "Last Action Hero" had when it was first released in theaters was the fact it was the first film to utilize Sony's Dynamic Digital Sound.  Granted, at that time, many theaters weren't equipped to play SDDS but there was concentration on the film's audio and that is where this Blu-ray shines.  The opening sequence alone shows you that the film is going to utilize all channels and thus bringing a more immersive soundscape as you hear gun shots, explosions, crashing metal, booms all through your front, surround and rear surround channels.  Subwoofer utilizes the booms and for the most part, this is the best I have ever heard from this film.  The lossless audio soundtrack for this 1993 film is very well-done!  Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.  SPECIAL FEATURES:  "Last Action Hero" comes with no major special features but is BD-Live enabled with movieIQ which allows people to obtain real-time information of the cast, music, trivia while watching the film.  JUDGMENT CALL:  When "Last Action Hero" first came out and when I watched in the theaters, I figured a pairing with director John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarznegger (known for their action films) would be a wonderful pairing.  But I can remember how impatient I was getting because the film seemed so long (especially at 131 minutes).  I felt that the arc where Danny is in Jack Slater's world tend to drag quite a bit.  But I admit that I enjoyed how it was a satire of action films and also featured cameos by many celebrities.  By the third and final arc, things started to get more interesting as Jack Slater is pulled out of his magical world and now having to deal with this new world that he is quite unaware of.  For the most part, "Last Action Hero" was a good popcorn flick but I do remember that since it came right after "Terminator 2: Judgment Day", there was high expectations.  Needless to say, despite what the critics may have felt about the film, "Last Action Hero" did well in the worldwide box office and even some appreciating the film much more now than when it first came out in theaters back in 1993.  For those who purchased the 2003 DVD and are big fans of the film, you maybe wondering if the Blu-ray is worth buying.  The bad news is that there are no special features on this Blu-ray unless you have BD-Live and you can take advantage of the movieIQ function.  But other than that, I'm still amazed that for a film that was quite expensive, featured so many talent did not have any featurette created for it.  No commentary, no theatrical trailer, there is no special features and to me, that's surprising.  But the Blu-ray is a major step up in picture and audio quality and that is where fans of the film will appreciate its HD release on Blu-ray.  Overall, "Last Action Hero" on Blu-ray is literally a barebones Blu-ray release but for Schwarzenegger or McTiernan fans and those who truly enjoyed this film will definitely enjoy it much more with its video and audio upgrade.
2 ||| This is certainly not one of the good Schwarzenegger movies.  Arnold plays a parodie of himself in this movie.  His "partner" is a 12 year old boy, and together they decided to fight crime in their town.  Really, that's about it for the plot.  And the acting just isen't any better.  When I saw this back when it came out in the 90s I was really disappointed.  I mean this is the guy who did classics like Terminator I & II, Total Recall & The 6th Day, just to mention a few of his glorious movies.  This is comparatively a real let down, don't believe the hype of most of the other reviews.  If your expecting something even remotely close to the just mentioned movies, then forget it, you won't find it in this movie.
2 ||| This movie has such a clever plot that never quite lives up to its potential, but does provide a few laughs and smiles along the way.  I saw this movie in the theater when I was the same age as the young protagonist and I thought it was awesome! My how things have changed since those carefree days when a million cameos and lots of explosions could make up for terrible writing and weak direction.  The Good: Tom Noonan as The Ripper is genuinely creepy and makes a great arch-foe for our Hero.  Jack Slater is a character with hilarious moments, especially when he calls himself, "Arnold Groundschmuger, the famous comedian". The spoof on the action genre is much funnier in retrospect than at the time of the film's release. Bridgette Wilson in cut-off jean shorts, 'nuff said.  The Bad: Danny Madigan goes from being cute to annoying so many times it makes you wish Benedict would just shoot him already.  Once the movie crosses over into the real world and Jack's "crisis" with being a fictional character the movie loses its focus and gets to wrapped up in whatever moral it failed to get across to the audience.  I would be willing to own this movie for the first hours worth of fun and comedy if not for the terrible pan & scan work that was done on the transfer (and I'm not shelling out $27.00 for the widescreen version).  Maybe someday when they release the LAH: Big Mistake Edition where we get an apologetic, film-roast of a commentary over a widescreen cut of the film, I'll fork over my dough, but until then: PASS!
0 ||| I love a lot of Arnold's movies but this movie is just a one time viewing.  My overall opinion a horrible movie, would have been great if it was actually funny.
0 ||| In my opinion, this movie has got to be Arnold's worst movie.  It was so stupid and boring, I turned it off 15 minutes into the movie.  I would give it NO STARS if I could!  Thank goodness Schwarzenegger's other movies make up for this turkey!  Definitely not worth renting let alone buying.  I would pass on this one.
0 ||| Last Action Hero had all the markings of being a great film. A good director, good actors (Charles Dance would be a wonderful villian). What made it fall apart was a weak story, and this would follow nearly all of Schwarzenegger's films post True Lies. To say Last Action Hero was rushed is quite an understatement considering John McTiernan did such a marvelous job depicting Bruce Willis and Sean Connery as two badass heroes in two brilliant written stories. If your a Schwarzenegger maniac go ahead and pick it up. But if your looking for that "movie within a movie" premise, skip this and check out Wes Craven's A New Nightmare.
2 ||| After a magical ticket blasts a young boy out of his seat and into the movie he's watching, his wildest fantasies come true -- battling the bad guys with his crime fighting hero.
2 ||| After MUCH deliberation, this was deemed an appropriate DVD to watch - after turning down all my other suggestions. And it turned out to be quite good! This was filmed before Austin O'Brien became truly cringeworthy, with a god-awful haircut in My Girl 2. He's exactly the same here, and there were times I wanted to take a pair of scissors to his hair! (I've just seen a more recent photo, and he looks totally different!) Last Action Hero has an almost Willy Wonka quality to it. There was a golden ticket that Charlie Bucket had to find and Danny Mannigan also had to find one - or actually got handed it. I was so waiting for Oompa Loompa's to come out! Now that would have been cool. The whole story climaxes in Arnie being brought out of the movie, and getting to see the 'real' world, which is a very interesting concept, as it could be seen as we're not the ones in control. (I totally believe that) So his whole life was one big lie, and controlled by someone else - not the big man upstairs, but a film director. Arnie basically takes the p*ss out of his whole on screen persona in this, including lots of his trademark sayings, including: "I'll be back!", "Trust me" and "Do it". There's also a very funny scene where Jack Slater meets Arnold Schwarzeneggar - make sense of that! Also look out for a whole host of cameos in this movie - ones which are easy, to spot, some which aren't! Some of these include: Chevy Chase, MC Hammer, Sharon Stone, Little Richard, Maria Shriver, Robert Patrick, and Jean-Claude Van Damme! There are some great lines in this. Some of these are: Danny Madigan: You think you are funny, don't you? Jack Slater: I know I am. I'm the famous comedian Arnold Braunschweiger. Danny Madigan: Schwarzenegger! Jack Slater: Gesundheit. Jack Slater: Kid! Who does the doctor treat? Danny Madigan: Patients? Jack Slater: Look at the elbow of my jacket. What is it doing? Danny Madigan: Wearing thin? Jack Slater: Bingo! Benedict: Gentlemen. Since you are about to die anyway, I may as well tell you the entire plot. Think of villains Jack. You want Dracula? Dra-cool-la? Hang on [takes out the ticket] Benedict: , I'll fetch him. Dracula? Huh. I can get King Kong! We'll have a nightmare with Freddy Krueger, have a surprize party for Adolf Hitler, Hannibal Lecter can do the catering, and then we'll have christening for Rosemary's Baby! All I have to do is snap my fingers and they'll be here. They're lining up to get here, and do you know why Jack? Should I tell you why? Hmm? Because here, in this world, the bad guys can win! So if you're not keen on Austin O'Brien, see how many celebrities you can spot, and how much Arnie acts up in this movie! It's so funny!
2 ||| A BOY [AUSTIN O BRIEN] IS GIVEN A MAGIC TICKET, AND WHILE HE'S WATCHING HIS MOVIE HERO'S LATEST FILM, HE ENDS UP BEING A PART OF THE ACTION. THIS STAR-STUDDED ACTION MOVIE IS OK, TO SAY THE LEAST, BUT FOR REAL, HOW DID AN INGMAR BERGMAN STORY GET INTO THIS MOVIE? ANYWAY, THE MOVIE STARTS OUT GREAT, BUT MOST OF THE SECOND HOUR IS A DISSAPOINTMENT. AS ALWAYS, ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER IS FUN TO WATCH AS JACK SLATER, THE MOVIE COP WHO'S THE BOY'S IDOL. CHARLES DANCE IS COOL AS THE VILLAIN WHO MURDERED SLATER'S SECOND COUSIN. THIS MOVIE FEATURES APPEARANCES BY MANY STARS, SUCH AS; JEAN CLAUDE VAN DAMME, LITTLE RICHARD, TINA TURNER, TORU TANAKA, ART CARNEY, AND MANY MORE. FAR FROM ARNOLD'S BEST, BUT IT AIN'T A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.
0 ||| This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. Terrible plot, and all the co-stars can't act at all. A big budget movie that should have never been made. A giant black mark on Arnold's career.
0 ||| This movie is the epitome of excess: budget, explosions, melodrama, "cuteness", in-jokes.  LAH is one of those films that thinks its a lot more hip and clever than what it really is.  It claims to be a spoof of the action movie genre when all it really does is shake its own hands.  The jokes are not funny and yet you get the feeling that the people responsible for this cinematic atrocity are sending a subliminal message that translates as, " That skit was pretty cool, huh?".  The action sequences, intended to be absurd, only elicit yawning.  The child, who was intended to be cute, is annoying. The only saving grace, if you can call it that, LAH has is Arnold Schwarzeneggar's performance.  His (non)acting is just as good in this movie as it is in THE TERMINATOR or TRUE LIES.  If the only good thing about your movie is Schwarzeneggar's acting, then your movie is in serious trouble. I like a good spoof movie as much as anyone, as long as it is funny like BLAZING SADDLES or THE NAKED GUN movies.  But I think this movie was best described on an episode of THE SIMPSONS.  On that episode there was a fancy party in which all the beautiful people of Springfield attended.  There was a character at the party inspired by Arnold Schwarzeneggar named Rainier Wolfcastle.  Police Chief Wiggum walked up the Wolfcastle and said, "Magic ticket, my a**!".  My sentiments exactly.
0 ||| I honestly thought that Arnold was making fun of his own career in this movie it was that bad. ... Totally boring, unbelivable and wooden.
2 ||| it's okay
0 ||| Truculent, unispired directed movie. The original idea was good, but was wasted while developing it. THi child is annoying, not a good actor at all.
1 ||| "The Last Action Hero" is a rare thing- an action comedy spoof that has difficulty remembering what it is supposed to be exactly. The action genre is certainly ripe for a mocking, what with the thousands of  "Die Hard" clones Hollywood has thrust upon the public. This  could have been the perfect spoof film- team "Die Hard" director  John McTiernan with The Terminator and let the jokes fly. But instead the  movie tries to be serious, then tries to make jokes about the genre, then  goes back to being serious again. The actors are making one kind of movie,  the directors are making another. It ends up a damn mess. Aside from a  humorous bit with Arnold as Hamlet at the begining, this one is a real dog.
1 ||| Child actor Austin O'Brien steals scenes in THE LAST ACTION HERO, although his stand-out performance is not enough to make the film worthwhile.  Not that the filmmakers weren't trying to make a quality picture.  For effort,  THE LAST ACTION PICTURE tops a number of routine action flicks (COMMANDO,  ERASER) Arnold has made.  But by time the closing credits roll, THE LAST  ACTION HERO's slow moments outnumber its memorable ones.  Inspirational  line: "It's what you make it."
2 ||| While I had marvelous service from the seller, this did not turn out to be the version I was hoping for. There are known complaints about the heavily edited nature of A Muppet Family Christmas, so I should have done my research better before buying it, but it seems that the all-regions import version is not the same as the UK version which supposedly has the unedited, original show. I made the assumption they were the same and didn't think to contact the seller and ask, so this is purely my own fault.  While I am glad to have at least a partial (although confusingly edited) version, and I really did get quick and excellent service as well as a great buy from the seller, I am still in the market for the elusive, full-content version of A Muppet Family Christmas. This particular version (due to copyright law and everyone wanting a piece of the financial pie) was very heavily edited before being sold in the US and many of the best songs (and thereby best scenes) are missing. This leads to non-existent scene transitions, random jumps in the story line, and an overall confusing film. Rather than a classic Muppet film and a nostalgic hearkening back to younger days which you can't wait to share with your family, it ends up as messy Muppet mayhem which fails to live up to memory's expectations.
1 ||| My mother taped this wonderful holiday classic on VHS when it first aired on TV for me and my brother when we were little and every year around Christmas I would (and still do) watch this holiday classic with my family. So a couple years ago when I saw that they had finally put it on DVD I thought 'Alright it's finally on DVD!' but it was so expensive, even the VHS's were selling for 20 to 40 dollars. So one year after Thanksgiving I started calling every video rental store in town just to see if they had this movie for rent and only one store did. I was really excited about it at first but when I started watching it I noticed that some things were cut out from the movie. Like Fozzy's musical comedy bit with the snowman (It's a very noticeable jump), the muppet home movies (that whole scene was cut out). Miss Piggy musical bit when she finally makes it to the farm house, and a small scene is missing when they do their 'Carol sing'.  I'm glad I only rented it and spent 2 bucks rather then spending more buying it. All I can say is save your money, if you've seen the original 'uncut' version that was aired in the 80's this DVD is not for you.
0 ||| Several others have documented all of the scenes that are missing from the US version. Search for this on e B a y - look for DVDs that have R2, UK or Dutch in the description. These versions have all of the scenes and are in English. The catch is that the DVDs are coded for Region 2 (US DVD players are Region 1) and are in the PAL format (US is NTSC).  If you can get your computer's DVD player to play Region 2, your system will play the PAL format just fine. If you want to watch this on a traditional DVD player, you will need to either get a region-free player or convert it over to NTSC.  The good news is that these versions are priced fairly reasonable on e B a y and the shipping cost was lower than I expected. You just need to wait 2-3 weeks for it to arrive.
2 ||| Lucky for me, I own an unedited video version of this 80's classic, that I am now extremely happy that I've held onto for all these years. The DVD apparently (besides being 200 bucks!) is also edited! What in the sweet baby Jesus is that about? I know this is a rarity, I just don't know why. Having had this video since I was a lad, and keeping it to bust out every Christmas, has earned me a lot of fans in the little tikes circuit. Every kid ever has really loved this one!  The one hour(ish) special is hillarious, and features not only the Muppets, but also the entire cast of Sesame Street, and Fraggle Rock (if you weren't a kid in the eighties, you may not know those guys, but they are there!) Antics are served up all around. Like when the swedish chef tries to cook big bird for dinner, after the turkey gives him the slip and starts hitting on Gonzos girlfriend Carmella. There is a scene where Kermit and his nephew attempt to sing a touching, heart warming rendition of Jingle Bells, but (always to my delight as a kid) get cut off by The Electric Mayhem who crank up the volume for a wild version of jingle Bell Rock. Anyway, too bad this thing is virtually unaquirable (seriously, I think you could find the video somewhere... try the used section at Blockbuster!) The DVD deletes some key scenes... like the snowman ("let me in! It's FREEZING out there!") or the continuosly running icy patch gag. (???) they're in the video, not the DVD. And I can't imagine who would spend such an outlandish amount of money on a one hour DVD... I wouldn't do it, and I'm pretty crazy. FIVE STAR SPECIAL but the DVD is a loss. Bumped it down to three. seek elsewhere.
0 ||| A MUPPET FAMILY CHRISTMAS is a truely enjoyable special, but instead of buying this DVD, I suggest you tape it off of TV the next time the Hallmark Channel shows it. Why? Because this DVD is edited.  These aren't just minor edits, but entire scenes are cut out and the edits are extremely noticeable.  It seems that Sony couldn't be bothered to get the rights for some copyrighted Christmas songs to release this unedited.  Well then, I can't be bothered to get the DVD, and neither should anyone else who cares about what he/she is watching.
2 ||| I am highly disappointed not only was I not aware that this DVD had scenes cut from it so when watching was in total shock to find them missing but to see others have found out as well the hard way. The wonderful scene with Fozzy bear and the snowman cut is horrible that was one of my favorite scenes and to have the scene with the home movies so horribly cut it's obvious as well well I think the company should have at least told us on the packaging that scenes were deleted due to copyright problems so that customers were aware of this now I own a DVD I most likely will NEVER EVER watch again. Thanks a lot to whomever decided to produce this horrible DVD!!! Make it all intact or not at all. Makes me wonder if I can find the same things with the other Muppets DVDs as well. If you want the entire movie as is intact DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. A wonderful movie ruined i'm crushed.
2 ||| I remember watching this special when it first aired on television back in 1987. What I remember most about it was that it brought together all of Jim Henson's Muppets (at the time); not only were Kermit and Company there, but the whole Sesame Street gang, and the Fraggles from Fraggle Rock. Fortunately, that togetherness remains intact. Unfortunately, about ten minutes worth of footage has been edited out and therefore makes this DVD inferior and uncomplete. Besides the Muppet family all getting together, I fondly remember a comedy act Fozzy practices with a snowman and about a minute's worth of a Muppet Baby family video. Both of these have been edited out of this DVD. Also missing is a scene when Miss Piggy slips on some ice. Nevertheless, the film is still enjoyable to watch. After all it is the Muppets and even when they are cheated from their just screen time, they make 40 minutes worth of viewing much more enjoyable than most of what can be found on television today. I would give this DVD 5 stars, but because of the missing scenes, it's only getting 3.
1 ||| One has to wonder about the reasoning behind removing so much of this wonderful special's original material from this DVD release.  I have my original copy that I taped off of television way back in the mid 80's, and I'd rather watch THAT, fuzzy degrading, annoying Osh Kosh commercials, and all...at least it's INTACT.  Not only have several songs been removed, but the final pay-off to a VERY long running gag (the icy patch) ended up on the cutting room floor, as well, being that it was at the very end of Piggy's song ("Home for the Holidays", cut out).  The editing is SO bad, you can actually TELL where things were removed.  Such a shame.  Here's hoping the matter can be settled, and a fully-restored version offered...though I wouldn't hold my breath.  After all, there are MANY more Muppet  television specials that have disappeared into the mists of time, as well.
1 ||| Really now...  When I heard that they were putting my FAVORITE Christmas film on DVD, I was so excited.  A Muppet Family Christmas is something I watch every December.  It's funny, sweet, and so entertaining.  But, unfortunetly, the version on this DVD is not the version I just praised.  There are massive edits that are very noticable to viewers who have watched it since it first aired on TV and may leave first time viewers confused.  Fozzie's duet with the Snowman is cut out, the Muppet Babies home video is cut out (leaving Doc with a very strange line that doesn't make sense) and in my opinion the best part, where Miss Piggy enters, sings her song and slips on the Icy Patch, is edited out.  The best Icy patch gag and it's left out of the DVD/VHS.  I am not going to buy this DVD.  Fortunately, my VHS tape still works well enough to watch it (yes with the OshGosh commercials and Double Mint Gum ones, too!).  Until they put the real complete version on the market, I will not spend my money on this DVD.
2 ||| I taped the original broadcast, and after watching it for many years, decided to buy a "real" tape of the program. I was very upset and disappointed to find they had cut what I considered some of the best parts of the film - and didn't even do a clean job of it. I do not recommend this to anyone who loves the original.
2 ||| If you're after a warm-hearted story which is essentially the Muppets singing Christmas carols around a basic plot then MUPPET FAMILY CHRISTMAS should be on your "To Buy" list. The whole cast are here: the  Muppets, the Sesame Street gang and the Fraggles. Several Holiday classics  are in this movie, as well as many old carols - the movie culminates in an  entertaining sing-a-long with the entire band of Muppets. MUPPET FAMILY  CHRISTMAS will please the audience it's aimed at - kids. They'll have great  fun watching how the Muppets spend the Yuletide season. Adults however will  be able to watch alongside without getting bored: it's the fact that the  Muppets are so watchable that reaps benefits for this movie.
2 ||| This sequel sticks to the tried and true formula of slasher flicks: trap a group of people in one location and slowly pick them off one at a time.  The body count is marginally higher.  Creatively speaking, it doesnt offer anything new to the genre.  But at least Jennifer Love Hewitt can add screaming to her list of talents.  The plot follows the two survivors of the first film.  At this point, Julie James (Hewitt) is prone to nightmares, providing false reality to add some much needed horror elements.  She is separated from boyfriend Ray (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) in distance and priorities.  Julie and her roommate Karla (Brandy) prove they have no knowledge of capitals and can't recognize a FAMILIAR voice that they are well acquainted with on a daily basis.  They think theyve won a FREE trip to a crappy resort in the Bahamas.  A resort almost barren of guests and staff.  Nothing suspicious there!  And its not the least bit worrisome when bloody bodies go missing, someone having cleaned up the crime scenes in an instant: spotless!  Blood is not that easy to clean up!  The rest of the movie requires a lot of running, screaming, hiding, dying..............  Logic aside, this is standard fare, entertaining enough in its own right, but nothing special.  The extra, tacked on ending, is a bit of a cheat and doesnt really work.
2 ||| One of the staples of the slasher genre has been the quick turnaround for a sequel.  While the 90s resurgence in the genre tried to change many things about the genre, the quick sequel was not one of them.  Thats why, a year after the first came out, we got I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.  It needed more time to iron out some serious plot issues (and considering this is a slasher, thats saying something).  As the movie opens, its been a year since fisherman Ben Willis (Muse Watson) stalked Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and Ray (Freddie Prinz, Jr.)  and their friends and two years since the four friends hit Ben with their car and left him for dead.  Julie is still struggling through all that has happened, which is why she finds herself struggling with grades while in summer school again and having recurring nightmares.  Things are looking up when her friend and roommate Karla (Brandy) wins a trip for four to the Bahamas over the 4th of July.  When an invited Ray doesnt show, Julies friend Will (Matthew settle) joins Carla, Carlas boyfriend Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer), and Julie for this trip.  They arrive on the island just before the first storm of the season hits, leaving them stranded as the only guests on the island.  But a message for Julie leaves her convinced that they and the skeleton staff are in danger.  Is she right?  And what happened to Ray?  The film actually gets high marks right away for addressing the tag from the previous film and trying to give us some character development for Julie and Ray.  Unfortunately, in an effort to increase the tension, we get several painfully obvious false scares before we get to the island and the movie really begins.  Now heres the part where Im going to be painfully stupid.  One of my problems with this film is all the people who are killed when Julie and Ray are the real targets.  I get that this is a slasher film.  I truly do.  That means lots of people have to die.  But I don't get why we are going after the people who do die.  In the first film, the collateral damage victims make a little bit of sense, but not quite as much here.  And this doesnt bother me in the Scream films like it does here, either.  Go figure.  So leaving my personal issues aside, we do get some decent stalk and kill sequences and a mix of sympathetic and annoying characters to be eliminated.  This part is all well done, and when the storm hits and the killing starts, its easy to feel the tension building.  Which brings me to the part that feels rushed.  In an effort to provide a twist to the story (required of all slashers, especially during the 90s), we learn a bit more about Ben, but none of that makes sense.  Even watching the movie knowing what will unfold, it feels like it is forced into the film.  And, despite efforts to set things up earlier, the climax still feels a bit du ex machina for my tastes.  Then theres one characters fate, which makes no sense.  Plus don't get me started on the final scene.  What worked in the first film definitely doesnt work here.  The acting is still decent, and I don't find anything to pull me out of the film.  Thats impressive considering the script the cast had to work with.  And Id be remiss if I didn't point out that the accident that started the whole rampage was actually two summers ago now, so the title really doesnt work either.  The thing with 90s slasher movies is they tried to be more intelligent than the ones that had come during the slasher mania of the 80s.  Sadly, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer fails in those efforts.  There are still some decent death and chase sequences, so die hards of the genre will want to check it out.  But be sure to turn off your brain before you start watching it.
1 ||| I think I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is an okay sequel and Jeffrey Combs is good in his minor role but Jennifer. Love. Hewitt.
1 ||| not an amazing movie by any means but if you just want a by the books slasher movie then this is the movie for you.
2 ||| I am an eighties baby so being how I was born in the golden age of horror films it should be no surprise that I'm a huge fan of the genre, in fact it's my favorite genre by far. I think it is human nature to be nostalgic about certain things. It's why the WWII generation hated rock & roll, and why baby boomers hate hip hop, because it's not from THEIR time so somehow it's inferior. Because of this when the 90's came along and all of the great horror series of the bygone decade were running out of steam (Halloween, Friday the 13th, A nightmare on elm street) horror movies were still around just not being pumped out week after week at the cinemas. That's until scream arrived in '96 giving the horror genre much needed jolt in the arm.  Seemingly overnight they were back again, one new film after the other and we as horror fans couldn't have been happier!  Okay, okay, okay, I know what your thinking, this is suppose to be a customer review of I still know...and this guy is giving us a history lesson on the genre as a whole, but there's a method to my madness, you see I remember being excited when I saw the first I know what you did...I remember enjoying it, and of coarse when I heard of a sequel I was more than sold on going to see it, which I did, and enjoyed it! Enjoyed it when it came out on video, hec, I even bought the DVD which I still have to this day, but all of those years I watched the actually thinking it was a quality film, it ISN'T! What changed my mind you ask well a little thing called growing up, and when you grow up hindsight is 20\20.  You see I know now why I really thought this film was good when I was a kid, HORROR was back back in a big way so I would, and did go to see any and everything back then and usually enjoyed the movies, but know as an adult I realize this movie is goofy at best.  I think I first realized it one night a few years ago when I caught it on tv. Nothing else was one so I decided to watch it. It was like I was seeing it for the first time with new adult eyes and I realized how ridiculous it was.  I could go into the plot in more detail but if you guys are reading this you probably already know the deal. Let's just say JLH survived "slicker guy" in the first film and now his back to finish the job, but this time there on an island with a scary old guy, someone who I think may be Jack Black in a bad wig, and POP STAR BRANDY! It's ridiculous from start to finish, from how they are lured to the island, why they are lured to the island and the goofy kills that happen throughout.  There are things that happen that are so ridiculous(Freddie Prinze Jr's character hijacking a boat at gunpoint and sailing through a storm, at NIGHT no less to save his ladylove but I mean it's JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT after all, you wouldn't do the same?  Despite realizing now as an adult that this movie was simply just a way to cash-in further on the who's the killer genre before the public lost interest it still is entertaining and fun to watch!  If you've been living under a rock and somehow have never seen the I know what you did...films watch the first one first (a much better, well made film) than watch this one next, but when watching the sequel forget about LOGIC, and good storytelling, just seat back and enjoy a bunch of pretty actors running around an island being chased by a guy in a raincoat!  Is this movie good? - Not in the slightest bit! Is this movie entertaining? - HELL YES!!!!!!  P. S. Don't forget to checkout a certain character's death by hook that is quite possibly the WORST CGI ever in the history of CGI, it's hilarious!!!!!!
2 ||| I have seen this movie when I rented it years ago.  It was ok, but It just wasn't that great to me.  What would of made this a better movie, is to have kept all four of the main characters alive from the first film and probably have kept the scenario in Southport, then maybe kill off two of them in this second installment.  One thing I didn't like was out of nowhere, added the two new characters to the movie.  Notice on the third installment of this franchise, 'I Always Know What You Did Last Summer', they added a whole new group of people.  This to me just killed off the movie all together and the interest to.  I might buy this DVD later on.  Still deciding.  I will always treasure the first movie in this series.
2 ||| Hmmm, how do you rate a movie you didn't get...? I got the First one instead...
2 ||| I Still Know What You Did Last Summer takes place one year after the events of I Know What You Did Last Summer. Julie is now in college, taking Summer classes in Boston; trying to avoid Southport to put the past behind her. The past still haunts her on a regular basis however as she constantly has visions and dreams of the murderous, vengeful fisherman, Ben Willis coming after her.  That afternoon, Julie and her best friend, Karla win tickets for 4 for a getaway to the Bahamas for 4th of July weekend via radio station call-in after answering the question of the capital of Brazil correctly.....or incorrectly. While Karla brings her boyfriend, Tyrell along on the trip; Julie plans on asking Ray, her boyfriend from the previous film to come along, but he initially declines out of frustration of her refusing to visit him in Southport. With Ray's ticket now on the table, Karla brings along her best friend, Will, who has a crush on Julie---and off they go!  Once the 4 arrive in the Bahamas, they discover that others have left due to a tropical storm on the way. With it just being the 4 of them plus hotel staff, things seem to go great so far...until Julie begins receiving mysterious notes, reminding her of "what she did" and until the staff and crew begin getting gruesomely killed off one by one by a familiar hooded figure with a hook for a hand. What Julie hoped to be a peaceful and relaxing Summer has now turned into another hellacious nightmare. Some things you just can't bury.  Overall: This was an okay sequel. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer moves away from the suspenseful thriller kind of movie that viewers witnessed in its predecessor and transitions to more of a slasher horror. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprise their roles from the first film as the couple of Julie and Ray. Logic doesn't seem to play much of a factor in this movie which definitely deducts stars from this rating. For example the entire radio call-in scene is questionable in terms of answering the question correctly. Also, Julie is constantly receiving reminders saying "I know what you did last Summer"; but in this case, shouldn't have been 2 Summers ago, considering that's when it all started? Or is the killer now mad about supposedly getting killed off last Summer? I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is one of those movies that have you asking too many questions throughout the duration of the film. The acting is subpar on certain levels as well. This would mark the last of the I Know What You Did films to feature any of the original cast and crew as a third sequel released in 2006 titled "I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer (avoid at all costs) featured a fresh new cast. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer gets a B+ in terms of gore and kills but the movie overall deserves a C - or maybe even a D
2 ||| This is one of those movies that got a second shot probably because Scream did.  The only difference was that Scream was actually creative and made fun of silly movies like this one.  Throw in every horror/slasher movie cliche this one had it.  I am all for having to suspend disbelief when watching one of these movies, but things like the killer being able to movie bodies around in a short period of time, and leave no trace of blood is just stupid.  Unlike the plot twist revealing the killer in the first movie, this one was easy to spot a mile away.  Plus we are subjected to Jack Black as a dreadlocked stoner.  The two things that this one had going for it is that the dialog was not as schlocky and stupid as it was in the first one.  And, despite the tease at the end of the movie, they thought better of making any more of these.  Like the predecessor I do not think this is a must see or must own.  If you are looking for a horror movie to watch for an hour and a half, it is not the best and not the worst.  Not something that you would really watch more than once though.
0 ||| Just watched this the other night for poops and giggles, holy jesus it's awful. You can see the twist the second you meet the character and everyone plays their crappy cardboard cut-out roles like a factory produced them. Really it's so unremarkable, so what's the appeal? Well the first one was a big success, so obviously it's riding on the coat tails, but what is it about dumb kids being underwhelmingly picked off by some guy in a raincoat.  Really it was entertaining to me though just because how stupid and typical it was, from the opening 'jump scare' where the white virgin wakes up in the middle of highschool class, I knew I was in for a craptacular 90's slasher. So white virgin wants to work on school like a good girl until her evil fun-loving black friends have her reluctantly come out and meet up with THE MOST OBVIOUS F***ING MURDERE-I mean sweet awkward innocent JC Penny Model # 12. The implications behind this movie are laughably obvious. "Ohhh she's so sweet and innocent, she deserves to live, but the fat stoner deserves to DIE! Take that people I passively look down on!".  Also in a packed and crowded club the director knows that another cheap jump scare needs to be tossed in or else the mouth breathing teenagers won't be interested, so white virgin sees a shadow reminding her of the killer until she realizes it's just the dark, but wait, it's the corner of a club with couches and everything, and no one's sitting there? Have any of them actually been to a club or did they have to ignore basic club settings in order for the cheap phoned in jump scare to work.  So eventually they wind up on the tropical island for some stupid trivia thing with the worst hosts ever, for CREEP FACTOR we have to have the hotel staff be antisocial and intrusive, the maid for example ignores white virgin, "oooooh, how creepy, she doesn't respond" F*** you that's stupid. Then they meet the hotel owner who glares at them and basically makes them feel as unwelcome as possible, even though his business seems to be going into the crapper. Then they meet Jack Black playing himself, and the guy seems friendly enough, basically offering the guests some marijuana if they need some, then Tiesha is all like 'get away from me you smelly hippie', there goes what little amount of empathy I had for these characters.  So much more stupid crap happens without a shred of thought or time put into the production, even the kills are PG-13 caliber (well by today's standards) and we often cut back to Freddie Prince Jr. doing, something? I don't really know what he just has a bad feeling and runs around, apparently as fan service to the girls watching. Then we get more standard cookie-cutter unorignal scenes such as NO ONE BELIEVING WHITE VIRGIN GURRL, or Token black guy is the first of them to get offed and no one seems to care.  Then later we meed biker chick who runs the bar, and while virgin white gurrrl lives, random biker chick is killed off, because the white suburb kids watching need to know that that lifestyle is looked down upon and you'll likely get murdered if you live like that. Token black girl living was only a treat for virgin white girl because no one else really cared about her character.  So OH NO CREEPY AWKWARD WHITE DUDE TURNS OUT TO BE THE MURDERER, no f***ing s***, who didn't see that coming a mile away? Then he disappears throughout the second half of the movie and only pops in once in awhile to remind the audience "hey I'm still here", then finally shows that he's the bad guy to the last retard in the audience who couldn't tell and puts his EVIL FACE!!! on. This wimp is the least threating villain ever, and his dad comes up and f***s him in the ass or whatever, I stopped paying attention at this point, this movie SUCKS! I put as much thought into this review as they did into this movie.
0 ||| Trash and an unnecessary sequel.  So many holes in this story it makes no sense. First of all if Karla is Julie's best friend and sees how much Julie likes Ray why is she trying to hook her up with someone else. She's not trying to help her alleged best friend and comfort her just go and sleep with someone else. Knowing that Julie is somewhat paranoid and Karla knew most of the story that Julie went through why is she sneaking around the apartment in the dark with no lights on in the house and if they go to the same school why would Karla think Julie was out of town, looks to me classes are still going on  To make this movie even more ridiculous, Karla the genius says Rio as the capital of Brazil and for those who know geography very well know right off the bat that this was a set up. Bill Cobbs' character knew that it was the wrong answer but yet didn't say anything to warn the four people that Rio was the wrong answer and help them try to go back home, waits until the last minute for the body count to pile up.  Ben Willis have so many opportunities to kill Julie when she's at the club, in the bathroom, in the tanning bed and don't do anything plus he could have killed Ray after he fell but didn't do anything there either. So this killer is a complete moron but the victims are even dumber when some of them were armed with weapons ( a knife, axe, baseball bat mind you) they completely forget they had these weapons and don't make it a possible 3 on 1 attack and just run. Don't even try to work together to kill this man. I guess if you have common sense horror movies won't exist.  Plot holes everywhere in this movie.
2 ||| okay what i mean is *SPOILER ALERT*  It was a decent slasher film.  It has some thrills and chills, running, suspense and all that good stuff.  The acting wasn't bad though mehki pheiffer got on my nerves but that wasn't him it was his character was obnoxious.  i was actually waiting on him to die so he would shut up.  Jack Black was a nice suprise. heres what i hated about it.  It was predictable and over done but the worst, the absolute worst part is that ben willis suddenly became immortal.  The different thing about ben willis is that he was a real guy who could be killed they just didn't pull it off.  They killed him though.  Bullet ridden and you know what at the end i knew they were gonna do it.  i knew they were gonna bring him back and they did.  Let the killer die and get a new idea writers.  Be creative, come up with something new because by the end of the second sequel if you don't let it go, it just gets pethetic.
2 ||| I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is a huge let down. Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) & her new best buddie Karla (Brandy) win a holiday to the Bahamas. Once there they are stranded after a hurricane warning. The fisherman shows up & starts slicing & dicing.  The sequel is nowhere near the same level as the original. Also the style is different. I KNOW was a clever build-up of tension. I STILL KNOW is all about needless gore, bikinis, tight clothes & cheap scare tactics.  I'll be fair and say that I wasn't bored by I STILL KNOW, the jumps did get me & when the action started I was drawn in to the drama. The film was OK, but it's a let down after seeing what was done first.  The thriller versus the slasher. There is a huge difference. Judge for yourself.
2 ||| i really liked the first I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and even though this sequal isent scary in the slightest, it still entertains. good points: -great ending (5/5) -pretty good acting (3/5) -smart title bad points: -the first thing you will notice in this movie is the overly dramatic music, which i think is a little over done, compared to the first -the fact that evry time someone opens a door ( for no apparent reasen) a dead body falls out. by the 3rd time im like "dont bother, theres a dead body in there". this gets really old by the end
0 ||| amazing 109 people out of 295 gave this sickening display of  B-cinema uniform acting no-no's...five stars. Horrendous, exceedingly poor inception, timing, predictable, not fun, not scary, not suspensful, lacked character development, irritating and nauseating tension, if any; grade school level acting responses to often life threatening situations, freddie prinz jr is enough to make this film a one star from jumpstreet, jennifer hewiit is cute...cute, not talented, cute.  The whole film is a basis of a makover of Scream which just goes to show, that anyone...ANYONE...can be famous...that is food for thought for all your theatre majors and film students.  Save your money, and save your precious time, avoid this film. "Uh, duh, uh duh," that is how one feels after viewing this atrocity; this mindless banter of redundant B film acting.  PATHETIC. I still don't know why I watched this. I still don't know why I'm reviewing this.
1 ||| I Still Know I Did Jennifer Love Hewitt Last Summer.....oops that's not what it's called...my bad. Anyway after the first ended with Hewitt getting attacked by hook man she's back and I guess we're supposed to believe the end of it was just her dreaming. In this her and her victims....I mean friends go on a trip "that she won on the radio" to a tropical island. Of course it rains there the entire time. I guess that was hook man's plan, to get her on a spooky looking tropical island and he must control the weather too "damn you hook man!". Actually no, because of him making it rain, we get to see her in tight shirts in no bra in the rain yelling "what are you waiting for!, what are you waiting for!, I need new lines!, I need new lines!".    Well guess I made it obvious that once they get their Hookie is there as well. He starts killing people...., including the nice drug dealer played by Jack Black. He gives his best performance ever!! Okay I'm just kidding, he's annoying. Since hookie wants Hewitt dead, it puts her friends in danger. Which pisses off Brandy's horny b/f played by Mekhi Phifer (E.R, 8-Mile) who's just on the island to do the nasty with her. While Freddie "I act so bad even my show was canceled" Prinze Jr. steals a boat to come to the rescue. Nope he doesn't rescue the movie with his acting abilities.. I actually found the movie to be a decent slasher flick. But the end is just awful and isn't needed. It should've just ended with Hookman realizing that Hewitt looked hot in a wet tight t-shirt and asking her to marry him. Instead he still wants to just kill her for being one of the people that threw him off a dock after hitting him with a car. You would think this guy would've just got a life by now.
0 ||| Director:  Danny Cannon  Cast:  Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Brandy Norwood, Mekhi Phifer, Muse Watson, Bill Cobbs, Mathew Settle, Jeffrey Combs, Jennifer Esposito.  Running Time:  100 minutes  Rated R for intense terror violence and gore, strong language and some drug use.  It might not have been the greatest movie ever made but, thanks to the canny direction and score, "I Know What You Did Last Summer" was a very effective thriller. Shame the same can't be said of this sequel, which crams in every slasher clich known to man with such little awareness of how hackneyed it all is that it actually seems to believe this is scary stuff.  In a fit of apparent desperation, writer Trey Callaway packs Julie (Hewitt), survivor of the first film, off to an island in the Bahamas when she wins a holiday thanks to a radio show calling her number. Joining her is fish-faced Karla (Brandy), her boyfriend Tyrell (Mekhi Pfeiffer, who I seem to remember used to have a promising career) and spare wheel Will (Matthew Settle). Joining them soon after that is the killer fisherman, who engineered the prize (the fact that Julie's number's unlisted doesn't set off any warning bells) and proceeds to slice his way from one end of the movie to the other. There are no boats scheduled for days, the phones don't work, and there's a storm on the way...you get the picture.  You can practically hear director Danny Cannon, whose last movie was the underrated "Judge Dredd" and who deserves a lot better than this, sighing behind the camera at just how witless all this is. Cannon does manage to captivate the beautiful island scenery and the excellently-captured eeriness of the hotel at which the quartet of teen protagonists are vacationing (it's also a sort of sad waste of overall possibilities when you reflect on how they utilized these potent settings); a couple good scares throughout, though nothing scary, as if any movie could be deemed such; Freddie Prinze, Jr. is certainly not a notable talent, yet he exudes sufficient charm and is a likable hero; Mekhi Phifer, in a stereotype black tough-guy role, gives his role some enjoyable attitude, but his disbelief of Julie's claims that a killer's on the loose become tiring and cruel. "I Still Know..." fails due to a maddening lack of logic, intelligence, and most plausible qualities of humanity in all the characters; entirely arbitrary and thus boring murders of all the islanders we don't even really know is an obvious compensatory ploy for the fact that only two of main five characters are killed; technically mediocre acting (except Hewitt), plus bothersome, forgettable work from newcomer Brandy; low-IQ script; splotches of incompetent directing throughout; an incredibly demeaning and character-betraying "shocker" finale that essentially tosses this film into the pile of identical slasher formula flicks from the past 20 years. Our only consolation is that it may just be a dream, a la the "surprise" ending of the first "I Know What You Did Last Summer"...I guess we'll find out if and when "I Still Know What You Did Lots of Summers Ago" is made.
0 ||| Please if you think this is good horor then you don't know what good horror is, this movie along with the first one and even all of the Scream movies are garbage any real fan of cult horror or real horror will tell you don't wste your money. Real horror is made from the start of the first night of the living dead 1968 till about late 80's then from there horror quit is not wat it use to be.  " I know what you did last summer " is not good AT ALL
2 ||| I quite liked the original to this sequel, being of course the cumbersomely named I Know What You Did Last Summer, and so was hesitantly looking forward to seeing this movie for the first time. Being basically a reply to Scream, this series (which I am sure will continue) is your standard pretty looking teens get terrorized by superhuman unstoppable madman intent on killing them in as gruesome a manner as possible. Any surprises here? Unfortunately not - the formula has been squeezed just a little too much for any real shocks, but it does maintain a steady pace and is a pretty watchable and thankfully short movie.  Starring the cleavage-based talents of Jennifer Love Hewitt, this movie is essentially a vehicle allowing said actress as well as Brandy to wear the skimpiest clothes possible. From this angle, the movie does not disappoint. The producer Neal H. Moritz claims he wanted this movie to be scarier than the original; in my mind he failed by a long shot. However, the production is slick and tight, the sound is glorious and the image is close to perfection, and I am sure many will enjoy it; men maybe more than women though - sexist remark as it may be, but Jennifer Love Hewitt didn't land this role for nothin'!
2 ||| That's what this movie is all really about, right? The girl is hooked on her little tight vest top. Which she bought two sizes too small in the first place. And she parades it and everything contained in that top about all over the film. All the guys are drooling in the audience. And all the girls, who are mere mortals, and do not have hair & makeup artists, great clothes off a rail which you don't have to pay for, and who are not blessed with such generous ... good looks :) are going green with envy!  OK, so that's my rant over. Considering this is a horror movie, and it's a sequel to a horror movie, you'd think there would be a third too right? Wrong! For some reason, the makers didn't follow the Scream route, and make a trilogy (or the following Scary Movie), but decided to go down the Urban Legend route, and only release two films. When we all know these horror movies are supposed to be trilogies! All great films are trilogies, come on! OK, maybe I'm going OTT. Actually, I should be reviewing the first one, but the disc of that, has sprouted legs, and gone walkabout. No doubt following Broken Arrow, and my necklace - hopefully not! Up to the DVD stealing/gone missing place in the sky! I still have the case, just not the disc. And I can't rewatch/review the film without the disc!  The great thing about this movie? To have all the characters filming in the pouring rain most of the time! (OK, except for Jennifer Love Hewitt, for the guys, you'll be concentrating mainly on the contents of her top to notice the rain) For some weird reason, I find water a cool effect in movies, whether it's pure rain, or the water itself. I'm weird. Love me!  Some people say there's too little of Freddie Prinz Jnr in this, and instead he gets replaced the hot'n'horny Mekhi Pfifer. Frankly, I couldn't care about either of them, nor do I care much for Brandy. She can't sing, and whoever thought she could act, should have been locked up in a looney (tunes) bin.  I like the movie, I just don't like the actors in it all that much. They're watchable that's about it. They're nothing special. For any guys reading this, this movie needs to be in your DVD collection. You'll get your kicks out of the contents of Jennifer Love Hewitt's top. Us ordinary females, will have to make do with plenty of concealer, and padded beyond belief bras.  This review has been one long moan hasn't it?! I thank you for reading.
2 ||| I know its bad ,cheesy and laughably unscary for a film that is supposed to be; but its so enjoyable that who honestly gives a damn?A perfect popcorn flick.
2 ||| This isn't exactly the scariest movie ever or the most original, but it does have just about the best acting I've ever seen in a horror movie. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Jennifer Espisito are great. Jack Black also does an excellent job. I definetly reccomend this show. It is an all around good time.
1 ||| OK Since  this was a sequel, we all knew what was gonna happen. The man is gonna be coming back after her to kill her once and for all. But some how her and her girlfriend excape any major cuts or killings. Sometimes entertaining but not worth a watch.
0 ||| I can understand why a sequel was made to "I Know What You Did Last Summer" because of the ending of the original.  But I DON'T get why it had to be so stereotypical and poor. The sequel follows Jennifer Love Hewitt's character Julie to college, where she still has flashbacks of that fateful summer where she was being chased by a hook-wielding killer.  Her roommate Karla, played with limited acting skills by singer Brandy, tries to take her mind off things and suggests that Julie dates someone new (Julie and Freddie Prinze Jr.'s character Ray are estranged at the film's start).  To their surprise, the girls win a trip for four to the Bahamas for answering a trivia question in a radio contest.  Julie invites new crush Will (Matthew Settle) and Karla takes along boyfriend Ty (Mekhi Pfeiffer). Here's where the problems start.  First of all, the writers must think that the average viewer of this film has a third-grade education.  Intelligent audience members smell a rat early on in the film when the girls incorrectly answer that the capital of Brazil is Rio de Janeiro (it's actually Brasilia).  When the real answer is revealed at the climax of the movie, did the writers expect everyone to go "Ohhhhh!!"?  I hope they don't think we are THAT stupid! Another problem:  the geniuses behind this film were obviously trying to clinch the attention of the males in the theatre by having Jennifer Love Hewitt run around in white t-shirts drenched with rain.  As a heterosexual female, I got tired of seeing Ms. Hewitt bounce around and felt this move was cheap on behalf of the filmmakers.  Well, with a sub-par plot and mediocre acting, I guess they felt the need to do something. One more pet peeve:  why must Hewitt sing at some point in every TV show or film she appears in?  I cringed at the contrived karaoke scene in this movie.  Don't you think it would been more obvious (and probably more enjoyable) to have already-established pop star Brandy sing a song? Viewers sit through one cliche after another until the unsatisfying and predictable twist is revealed at the end.  And then the ending itself is another cliche, hinting once again at another installment.  Thank goodness it hasn't been made (yet). Chalk this up as another unnecessary slasher flick specifically made to capitalize on the success of "Scream."  While "Scream" had a certain wit to it, this is plain silliness rolled up with blatant T & A.  Don't waste your time.
0 ||| If you couldn't get enough of attractive well-known actresses from this month's hot TV show being casted in moronic horror movies with no love for the genre whatsoever then I've got good news. Another "I Know What You Did" film. The fisher man with the hook for a hand is back after Hewitt and her obnoxious friends which include returning Freddy Prinze, Brandy, and Mekhi Pfefier as the token black guy. A year after the first incident, Julie (Hewitt) and company have won a trip to a tropical resort. Little do they know that it has all been set-up by the killer from the original and he is looking for a little more retribution. A predictably gory onslaught ensues to the backdrop of an incoming storm that is making life even more difficult for these poor kids. Hewitt is the highlight of this film- but not for her acting chops. Her beautiful cleavage and knack for wearing soaking-wet white T-shirts is really the only redeeming value in this very dumb sequel. Jack Black as a goofy white wannabe Jamiacan is too annoying for words. Freddy Prinze is as terrible as always in his portrayal of goofy guy-next-door Ray. Love gets to do her thing here as she not only sings karaoke but gets to explain to co-star Pfeifer why "her people can't dance". Even tremendous character actor, Bill Cobbs, is wasted in this awful sequel. It's over-acting galore as Hewitt and Brandy trade screams and arguments back and forth in the rain. As mediocre and tired as I found the first film, the script for "part two" manages to show it up in every way except the good kind.
2 ||| I actually havnt even seen the first one lol so I cant say it was worse.  This movie was ok, I think Jennifer Love Hewitt is hot as hell though so that probally helped.  A group of friends (some survivors from the last movie) go to the caribean for a vacation they won.  And guess what happens? A storm comes and they cant get off the island, but not before the killer gets on the island.  Thats when the slashing begins.  Some deaths in this movie are gory and others arent.  I would say see the scream series before this movie.  Unless you wanna check out Jennifer ;)
2 ||| This movie was not as good as the first one, but it is still worth watching. Instead of Gellar and Phillippe, Mekki Phifer and Brandy are added to the cast. I only gave this movie 3 stars because it sort of did too much on the killing and made it look unreal and unbelievable, it also left out too much of Freddie's Character only having him appear in certain points and at the end. It also didn't make sense how in the ending the gun all or a sudden was stocked with bullets. Despite all that it provides a good plot and characters that work well together, following Julie, Carla, Tyrell, and Will on a radio won trip to the Bahamas where their in for a wild ride, of course too make the story sensible that is the real home of the last movies killer ben willis, out to get them. This movie also has a bunch of twists and you won't know whos an enemy and who will help when it comes down to the end. I'd recommend either renting or buying this movie at some point and if you loved Scream or the origninal you won't be dissapointed!
1 ||| Two years have passed since Julie James was tortured by her fish-hook wielding nemesis, a victim of her friends' hit and run.  However, the body was never found.  Still living in fear, and in college, Julie is delighted when she and her friends win a holiday to the Bahamas in a radio competition. Although I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is meant to be a revenge sequel- it seems to focus more on advertising on a holiday in the Bahamas.  By the end of the film, we are sick and tired of Julie's moaning and just want to see her get slashed and gashed!  Yet again, the film ends with sequel potential. Question is- can we handle another Summer sequel?  Or is the series tired enough as it is? I Still Know What You Did... still manages to get away with the usual horror sequel criticisms.  So hopefully, producers will prevent another sequel spawning unless they want the whole saga to become one big embarrassment.
1 ||| Julie James is back with Brandy, not the drink. They go on vacation to the Bahamas, but boo-hoo! It's raining over there. Throw in Jack Black as a Jamaican plant expert. Better. "Find another jacuzzi," says Karla's (Brandy) boyfriend to an unwanted visitor. "It's all good," says the expert. The fisherman is back and hungrier than ever. His hand is now the hook! Wow! He pulls a double shift on the lodge and the teenagers. A bartender lady is tough, whoa, and a sneaky bellboy who's 60 years-old, steals toothbrushes. Whatever. Guys will enjoy this if they like Hewitt. Overall, "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer" is way too long of a title for me to type, funnier than the first, Julie looks healthy, and Jack Black was thrown into the mix! Decent, but still lacking any intelligence.
2 ||| If I were a fan of corny teen slasher flicks, I probably would have enjoyed this more.  I like how this sequel stayed true to "I Know What You Did Last Summer". The movie  , again, followed Jennifer Love Hewitt's character, Julie.  After her horrific summer about two years ago, Julie is still having nightmares.  Later, when Julie and her best friend Karla (Brandy) win tickets to go to Hawaii, Julie thinks that she will have a relaxing vacation.....boy, is she in for a suprise. I don't want to give anything else away, so just go out and rent this movie if you are a fan of teen slashers.
1 ||| Jennifer Love Hewitt and her friends go to the Bahamas for a weekend of fun and sun, but the storm season holes them in and psycho killer Ben Willis is back and out to kill them all.  Sequel to the middling original is very stupid (just think, the killer goes through the trouble of conning all these people to the island and decides to off not just them, but even the islanders?) and has almost no story, but remains a bit watchable thanks to the last 35 or so minutes, which features a LOT of running, gratuitous cleavage shots, and bloody slasher action.  Too bad the villain is dressed in a silly fisherman's outfit.
0 ||| I Still Know...is as absurd as they come. Four teens, who are sharing a brain, win a trip to the Bahamas. They arrive to learn that they have arrived at the end of season, which is the 4th of July. Forget the fact that they don't celebrate the 4th of July there. This is a neat way of reducing the cast size. Later, there is a supposed hurricane, but the production company wouldn't put out for more than one rain machine, so it's pretty dinky. It does make a fine mess of Hewitt's hairdo, which was bad before it got wet. The fisherman they thought they killed in the first movie is back, and boy! is he upset! The kids waste a lot of time chasing the wrong killer. One of the hotel employees practices voodoo, so he's got to be it, right? No, this is the Caribbean, not Omaha. I lost track of the body count because the person I watched this one with couldn't keep a straight face. When I said I was doing my job, they really fell apart. This is that new breed of movie in which no one knows how to write the music. Here, there is scary music every time someone turns their back to the camera. HD20 had the same problem. These little movies used to have some interesting music, as well as some swell camera angles. Now they've all turned into MTV marathons.
0 ||| 'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer' really does milk the slasher formula.  It's a follow-up to the pretty good 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' but the first movie already killed off the only two members of the cast that could act.  The title is also all wrong - shouldn't it be the summer before last? The story involves Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and her new best friend (Brandy) win a trip to the Caribbean.  So off they hop to a conveniently remote island with Brandy's boyfriend and a random guy that they don't know.  The fact that's it's storm season leads to a lot of obvious plots involving people not being heard over the wind and a lot of thunder that is probably supposed to rack up tension.  There is absolutely nothing tense about this movie.  The usual round of killings ensue with a man stalking through the hotel, which is inexplicably almost empty save for a few signposted red herrings. Whilst the first movie had a tongue-in-cheek yet still fairly creepy script by Kevin Williamson of 'Scream' fame, this has no hallmarks whatsoever.  Apart from Brandy, who manages to ground the rest of the cast, the acting is dismal.  It says it all when the audience looks forward to the arrival of Freddy Prinze Junior.  The ending is laughable and there isn't a scare in sight.  This isn't just one of the worst sequels ever made but one of the worst movies too.
2 ||| (NOTE: Partial spoilers of earlier movie) I'll rank this a three on a 1-5 scale I've devised particularly for use in rating sequels for which I liked the original. The scale would work as follows: 1: So bad I'd now just as soon have not liked the original. 2: My liking for original is intact, but sequel adds virtually nothing to my enjoyment. 3: Sequel enjoyable mainly on the strength of how original made me care for the characters and their continuing story, not a great movie in its own right. 4: Sequel satisfying, coming close to or rivaling the original in quality. 5: Exceptional sequel, surpassing the original in quality. So, in the case of this movie, the sequel leaves considerable room for disappointment but maintained my interest because the first made the characters interesting. Even at that, Jennifer Love Hewitt came much closer to having to carry the movie this time, because Freddy Prinze, Jr. was reduced to cameo-level appearance this time, and most of the rest of major players in the original played characters that didn't survive that movie. Particularly missed in the sequel for the latter reason were Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and especially the undercast Brigette Wilson. Other things that detracted from this sequel are that the screenplay, editing, and/or direction seemed amateurish at times. The main Character Julie (played by Hewitt) sings "I Will Survive" as a karaoke song, a scene better omitted. I can't speak for viewers unfamiliar with karaoke, though I suspect they might have limited appreciation for its inclusion in movies. But those of us who are karaoke singers and/or listeners know that "I Will Survive" is one of the most run-into-the-ground of karaoke songs and we're sick of it. Also her scene where she gets into the sunlamp box is also awkward and probable not too pleasing to anyone. Those not liking scantily-clad scenes will find it "exploitative", but those who do will find it tame and unrevealing. Other awkward moments would become ponderous to enumerate. Julie's new boyfriend in the movie, who accompanies her to the Bahamas (the reason for Prinze's sparse appearence in this) is played in an awkward way, and his character's transitions along plot twists are lame and not highly believable. As for the scenes set in the Bahamas, they were actually filmed in Mexico and it shows. They show good-sized mountains, non-existent in the Bahamas. But in that department, this sequel in no way outdoes the original in impertinance, for the original had some mountain scenes too, even though ostensibly set in and around Southport, NC, an area where all land within view is at least as flat as the Bahamas. The most memorable new character in this sequel, though even he has been called ineffective and/or miscast, is a resident pothead in the Bahamas, played by Jack Black. His character has some mildly funny moments, though they missed a chance to give him what could have been the movie's funniest line. In the movie, most every character at one time or another falls under suspicion of being the killer on the lose; when it came the pothead's turn to be suspected, he should have said, "Don't look at me - I don't even know what I did last summer!" The end of the movie seems a possible set up for still another sequel. If one is made, I hope it can come closer to recapturing the quality of the original rather than languishing at the level of this first sequel.
2 ||| The sequal to I know What You Did Last Summer is unfortunatly not nearly as great as the first one. In this movie Julie(Jennifer Love Hewitt)is in college and is just not doing to well. Boyfriend troubles,not doing too well in school,still haunted by what happened the previous summer,etc. One morning her roomate,Karla(played by Brandy),gets a call from a radio station and wins a trip to the Bahama's. Little do these friends know is there is an unwelcome visitor waiting for them on this island. The movie starts out very promising,but drags out in to another slasher sequal. The twist in the end was very well done. There were a few suspencful scenes. But the movie also had some holes,draggy pointes,and a horrid and very predictable ending. The acting wasn't nearly as good as the it was in the first. Freddie Prinze Jr.didn't do all that great and I expected a little better from Brandy. All in all I say give this movie a try,but don't expect it to be better than the first one.
1 ||| This sequel, I Still Know What I Did Last Summer, is a stinker. Not that it doesn't have it's brainless appeal. It does. What makes the first film look like a classic, is that this film doesn't have the fun, cool set-up of the original. It had a creepy feel. This one just falls into typical Friday The 13th type 80's slasher feel in the second half. Not that that's bad. It can be fun. Just don't expect anything from it. Jennifer Love Hewitt is okay in this, but the appeal she had in the first isn't quite here in this one. She seems to be there just to have really hot shots of her body which, um, well, okay, that wasn't a bad thing. Brandy, on the other hand, was wasted. Why was she in this?. Why did she agree to do this?. Freddie Prinze Jr. was another one who was wasted. He got second billing but his part is much smaller than any of the other co-stars. What happened?. The fishermen killer himself was creepy in the first one. Not here. His creepiness was ruined because you see way too much of him in this film. That always hurts a film and character. The ending had another "shock" like the original. Nothing shocking about it. It was expected. You could tell. Let's hope Kevin Williamson comes back to give the third outing more of a hook. Pardon the pun.
2 ||| As most people say: "The first was better." In I Still Know's case, that's the truth. I Know was a whole better in the sense of suspense and plot. In I Know, it was fresh and original. In I Still Know, we knew the story and who the killer was and why he wanted to kill. We were just shown some new chase scenes and a bit more gore.  Not that the movie is bad, it's just that they could have come up with something a little better. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprise their roles as the survivors from I Know, Julie and Ray. New faces are Brandy, Mekhi Pfeiffer, Matthew Settle, and Jennifer Esposito. All give a little less than solid, but not bad,  performances.  The ending does give a nice twist, and doesn't fall flat on that. I Still Know is a good movie, although my review seems to give the front that I didn't like it. I did. But I prefer the first much more. Although I Still Know will be watched over and over by me. Well, at least once a year. During the summer.
2 ||| IT WAS AN OKAY MOVIE.  JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT, AND FREDDIE PRINZE JR. ARE BACK AND VERY GOOD IN THIS SEQUEL, BUT AS THEY SAY, SOME THINGS ARE BETTER LEFT ALONE.  SEQUELS ARE HARDLY EVER AS GOOD AS THE ORINGINAL.  THEY HAVE A GREAT TALENT BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.  I THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER IF THEY WEREN'T IN SUCH A RUSH TO PUT OUT A SEQUEL.
0 ||| "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer," if nothing else, should at least get an Academy Award for Longest Movie Title of 1998. In fact, the title could be a testament to the movie itself: unnecessarily long, cheesy, and a big letdown as a sequel to a movie that is only slightly better. The plot is pure contrivance for the conveniance of putting its characters in unspeakably tedious situations, the acting and characters are equally uninvolving, and the overall message gleaned from this film is one that portrays it as a pointless excuse for bloodletting and gore. The movie picks up where the predecessor left off, with a silly dream sequence that seems to belong in a comedy spoof of these films instead of here. Julie apparently has been haunted by these dreams for many months since her last encounter with the killer from the first film, Ben Willis, who fell off the boat in the end of the movie and was never seen again. Until now, but more happens before then. Julie's best friend, Carla, wins a trip to the Bahamas by answering incorrectly to the question requiring the capital of Brazil. Of course, given the mentality of this film, I wouldn't expect too many people to know the right answer, and I guess the filmmakers were counting on that, too. Anyway, Julie calls up long-lost Ray, asking him to go to the Bahamas with her, Carla, and Carla's boyfriend Ty. Ray refuses her, but then decides to surprise her. Of course, on his way to meet Julie at the airport, he is set upon by Ben Willis, and ends up in the hospital, from which he escapes and spends the rest of the movie trying to reach the resort. That resort is Tower Bay, where the group, along with newcomer Will Benson, who has it bad for Julie, finds out that the resort is left entirely to them due to the incoming of heavily inclimate weather. "This is our version of winter," says the hotel clerk. So pretty soon, the rain is falling, and so are the bodies, moreso than the first movie, and much more gratuitously. The movie really has nowhere to go but down from here, relying heavily on gore, blood, and useless plot twists to create what they hope will be a sense of tension and suspense. No such luck. Yes, we do spend some time wondering who is going to meet the fishhooked Ben Willis next, but since we never get the chance to know the characters, we never can care for them once they are killed, sauteed, gutted, and what-have-you. There is never a moment in this movie where you'll find yourself saying, "This is such a good film," because there's never any reason to. What makes it even worse is that the movie makes itself out so that it is not necessary to see the first in order to get the second. It spends so much time dwelling on the past that its concern for its own events are missed by a longshot. Nothing but contrivance for this film as well, bringing us the same, tired situations that its characters dwell in, going over the same old routine until we feel like we've seen every horror movie known to man. Ben Willis was supposedly killed in the ending of the first, and even if he's alive, he missing a hand. Not a problem. Slap a new hook on him in place of the severed hand, one that's permantently attached, so he can kill quicker and easier. Now the characters need to be placed in the most vulnerable of positions at key points in the movie. All taken care of; just send them to a secluded island paradise that is about to experience a major weather crisis. Need a couple of simple characters for extra bloodletting. Hotel management: 'nuff said. Are you seeing a pattern here? And what is with the secondary characters of the movie, anyway? One of them is the waitress in the hotel bar, who always seems to be giving us hints that she may have something to do with the killings going on, but trust me, thinking that way leads nowhere. And what about that pot dealing freak with the dread locks? This is as hokey a character as you can get, and never have I seen such a waste of plot on such a stupid character (though I kept wishing he'd hand me a joint to get me through the rest of the movie). The character of Will is a wuss, enough said, and even when it comes time for his major involvement in the plot, it turns out to be one of the cheesiest and most contrived aspects of the story. I had a hard time trying to decide as to whether or not this is one of those bad movies that happens to good actors, or if they should be held responsible for getting into it. Hewitt and Prinze, Jr, who reprise the roles of the earlier film, should have known better when they read the script that this material would not be sufficient enough to live up to the standards, however low, set by the first film. Brandy Norwood and Mekhi Phifer are the newcomers in the places of Phillipe and Gellar, and Phifer is the most amusing as the oversexed boyfriend who turns sexual frustration into comedic relief; Brandy is okay on TV, but I think in this case, a bad movie happened to her as an actress. In watching this movie, I kept thinking to myself, "People are actually going to like this." Then I found myself thinking of the demographic group who would gobble this stuff up and actually enjoy it. This is going to appeal mostly to young teens who want to be more like the older set of teenagers who have seen movies like this, one of those "in-crowd" movies that makes you look popular. To those who fit into this group, you're in for a sorely rude awakening.
0 ||| The original I Know what you did Last Summer was scary, suspensful, and interesting. This sequel is so bad, I don't know what I can say to caution you strongly away from it. Problem number one: There just aren't enough characters to sustain interest. Brandi, a definitely talented and charismatic actress/singer is totally wasted in her role. Jennifer Love Hewitt will grind relentlessly on your nerves, and your sympathy level for her plight will become nonexistent. Instead you will feel as if you, the viewer, are trapped on that island....and bored out of your mind.
1 ||| well, what to say about this trash other than "Don't waste your time watching it like I did !! "" Movies like this are responsible for the bad reputation sequels generally have !! Irc !! Only Jennifer is amazingly pretty here, the rest is a screenplay so bad that the producers must be laughing until now ...
0 ||| Even if you watch this as a comedy, you'll feel bad. You take an already weak plot from the original and throw away any merits it could have in this  lousy sequel. Jennifer is amazingly pretty, is the only point worthwhile  watching. The end was a bad joke. If they are trying to turn the killer  Will into another Jason, Freddy or Myers, it won't suceed.
0 ||| I can't believe a sequel was made. It's not like IKWYDLS was original or that anyone ASKED for a sequel. The idea of sequels isn't a bad idea. If the sequel improves on the original or develops the characters more it is a  very good idea. But ISKWYDLS was ONLY made to make money from the naive  audiences who saw the first.  Well we were very much robbed. This film is  worse than the first. Nothing surprising happens. It is a VERY badly  written film, I kid you not. This is not the films worst quality. The  acting, photography, lighting, direction, music and editing are terrible.  Even the title is too long and stupid. I STILL KNOW would have been a much  better title.  Like many of it's predecessors, in the late 90s and early  80s, we have close-ups of the actors who are suddenly surprised by their  friends from behind while being suspicious that someone is at that moment  watching them. While this happens a burst of very, very loud music tries to  enhance the "effect" of the "scare". The other clich it doesn't bother to  not use is the one where we think that "The killer" is watching them from a  closet or something and then we realize it's just cat or banging window in  the wind. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN (during a moment of false security) THE  KILLER APPEARS OUT OF NOWHERE. Puh-lease. Give us a little credit.
1 ||| Why do some directors and writers of horror movies think it's fair to completely annoy their audiences with these ambiguous endings, so that even though you may have enjoyed the movie, you hate the resolution!  It's such  a cop out.  It's like they're telling you, the third in the series is  coming out.  Unfortunately, this particular series should probably stop.  I  liked the first movie a lot; it was suspenseful, imaginative, and pretty  scary.  The acting was generally better too.  This time around, the acting  and script are pretty irritating.  First of all, anyone who knows their  geography will get a big clue early in the film.  Secondly, Freddie  Prinze's character is such a jerk in the beginning, you can't believe his  sudden transformation.  Third, I figured out the villain very early in the  film, so there was little suspense.  The acting overall is lame; Jennifer  Love Hewitt has decided to join Neve Campbell in the "I'm only doing  this for the money, and I'm really wasting my time in this silly horror  movie."  She does look a lot like Kate Jackson in this one, though.  Freddie Prinze is absolutely awful, completely unconvincing, and a pretty  shoddy hero, to boot.  The guy who plays Titus is an offensive,  stereotypical insult to intelligent viewers, providing none of the comic  relief the director obviously wanted.  Jeffrey Combs, who was so good in  the "Reanimator" movies looks as bored as Miss Hewitt, and does  nothing to pad his resume.  Three actors do manage to rise above their  material:  Jennifer Esposito as Nancy, the barmaid is very good; Brandy is  surprisingly effective as Julie's best friend, although her character does  become annoying and stupid; and Matthew Settle as the good-natured Bill is  very effective.  I still think Gorton's should sue for using their  fisherman image, but it is a horror movie.  That's what so sad.  It could  have been a lot better, but it's too predictable and a little too gory, as  well.  When all is said and done, "Halloween" and "A  Nightmare on Elm Street" (the first in the series) are still the  benchmarks for modern horror movies!
1 ||| This is a sequel to horror movie that wasn't even all that good (or all that scary).  This is a movie with possibly the worst ending a horror movie could have.  This is a movie with no suspennse, no surprises at the end.  This is a movie that's main characters are so uniteresting that you find  yourself hoping they'll get axed.  The most interesting character in the  whole film is the bartender at the hotel played by Jennifer Esposito.  Of  course Esposito gets little time in the film, being only a minor character.  This was not the worst movie I've seen, but it is definitely near the  bottom of the pile.
1 ||| When I saw "I know what you did last summer" at the theater I was hooked. When I heard there's gonna be a sequel, I was like "Wow! Can't wait to see it" It was a big dissapointment when I finaly saw  it. First of all it completely destroyed the brilliant ending of the first  part. I think it should have been better connected instead of just being  explained as a nightmare. The character of Julie James is still pretty  interesting but all of the new characters are pale  in comparison. There  are a lot of really gory sequences, which are fun to look at but there  isn't as much suspense as in the first. The producers just thought  "bloodier equals better" I guess but that just isn't the case.  The ending is a ridiculous repetition of the ending of the first one and I  hope this doesn't mean there's going to be another sequel. If you like  seeing Jennifer Love-Hewitt and a lot of blood then this movie isn't too  bad after all but if you're looking for believeable characters and a clever  story line you're gonna be dissapointed.

1 ||| The only thing stopping this film from being downright awful is the solid  characters. It isn't that long, but it feels extremely drawn out, which  shows the suspense it is lacking. The plot is very flimsy-even for a horror  movie. After only the first 45 minutes I was asking my brother if it was  nearly done. A positive is the characters. There interaction is the only  thing that interested me at all. Besides that, the way the director  constantly tried to lead you into beleiving something was going to happen,  then it not happening, then happening a couple of seconds later was  irritating and uneventful. Someone was trying too hard. So, sadly, this  didn't make me jump or even bat an eye once. And then there is the white  guy who's acting like whats seems to be a Jamaican-and thats in the big,  bad stereotype way. Probably meant to be comic releif but you only end up  wanting him to be killed off so you don't have to suffer with him anymore. I think I've ranted enough but last words: don't bye, rent. And even then  only if you're really bored.
0 ||| Jennifer Love Hewitt, accomplished thespian, once again brings her heart-rending acting abilities to the fore in this magnificent masterpiece that rivals Citizen Kane.  Oh, how the heart races as the cast, including  the brilliant, Shakespearian Brandy, battle mean old Captain D.  And, the  ending!  What a stroke of genius to leave the movie open for another  sequel!  What bravery the filmmakers display.  These cinematic pioneers at  least deserve an oscar for audacity!  Intelligence, be cursed, I say!  Long live the new horror film!  Here's hoping for the next five sequels.
2 ||| I am  a  big fan of movies espeically the horror genre..  The sequel to  I Know What You Did Last Summer  was  slightly a disappointment to me.. The first film  had  me on  the edge of the seat the whole time  providing  a  few jolts in my seat.. The second one  just didn't do the same for me ..  It had  a couple new twists to  the story line.. that  was kinda  cool..Towards the end of the movie  it kinda throw me .. But this time  around  a found myself chuckling more .. The characters  aren't any thing  real special  it got to the point for  me  when they got killed off i was  like  oh  well ..  If you loved the first one  I suggest you to get one  highly recommended ..  For this one buy this one at your own  risk
2 ||| Main character is in college trying to forget about the events of the past year when she and a friend win a trip to the Bahamas and the killer from Part 1 enacts bloody revenge. Better than the first one, with breath taking  settings and some nice cliched heavy-violence. Popcorn, pepsi and pepsi.
1 ||| this has got to be the most pointless sequel ever made. I hated the fact that it completely ignored the ending of the original. the plot did not make sense and the ending was even more ridiculous than the entire movie. I  know what you did last summer was one of the few slasher films that could  have and should have stayed away from a sequel. I actually want a third in  the series to tie up all the loose ends and ridiculously bad ending in this  one. Not bad as a slasher pic, but pretty pointless sequel....
1 ||| I really liked the first film because it focused more on suspense than gore. With the sequel, suspense took a backseat. It was basically just hooks in the eyes, throat and chins, and no curiosity as to what might  happen next. Now don't get me wrong. I think Jennifer Love Hewitt is hot as  hell, but the filmmakers could've made it less cheesy if they didn't have  her running around in a wet t-shirt for the duration of the movie. It was  such a throwback to those 80's slasher films. Also, I knew right from the  beginning who the killer's accomplice was. Will Benson! That sounded a  little too much like Ben Willis. I knew originality wasn't in Hollywood's  dictionary, but they could've come up with a name that wasn't so obvious!
0 ||| You know, if they try to be like Friday the 13 movies with all the sequals, i would not be surprised that in 20 years, they make one where the stalker has alsymers disease and I think they should call it "I DON'T  KNOW WHAT YOU DID THAT SUMMER" -Sometin' Kool
2 ||| I still know... Pros: *Cool direction. *Good screaming skills from the actresses. Cons: *A little bit repetetive if you saw the first. The bottomline:rent it and its predecessor when you have nothing  to do.
2 ||| The sole survivors from the first film win a  vacation to a tropical island. Here, they get stalked by the fisherman with the hook again. But this time he has a hook for a hand, which provides a but of atmosphere.  Still not that great, but not nearly as hopeless as it's made out to be.  Scary than the first, and a bit more entertaining.
0 ||| Hewitt is in college and trying to get on with her life when her friend wins a trip for 4 to the Bohamas. There, they and a bunch of innocent bystanders are killed one by one by the killer from part I and his son.  Gets off to a great start, but falls into the rut of predictability with an  overdone body count.

0 ||| This movie hold now Biblical truth, I was very disappointed in it.
2 ||| I just enjoy watching The Seventh Sign. It's not the best movie ever made but it's entertaining and a far cry better than today's reality crap.
2 ||| OK
2 ||| This movie was different, but fairly interesting. I love to study  prophecy, so that is what drew my attention. Some of the information was new to me, so I am not sure of the reliability of the content.
2 ||| When i recieved the package the cd was moving in the case, as i opened it there was scratches on the cd so i will take it for repair to be buffed out. i really and truly thank you all for the movie have been looking for it for years, its not your fault it was how the handled the package but i am very pleased to say i will order from you all very soon.. thank you so very much.
2 ||| Was a slow movie drama, whithout more action. Present a beautiful message to encrease the faith. But with low dramatic end.
2 ||| A series of tragic world events seem to signal the End of Days as prophesized in the Book of Revelations, with a pregnant housewife left to decide the fate of the world in THE SEVENTH SIGN! Demi Moore stars as expectant mother Abby Quinn in this religious thriller, which never manages to generate any real excitement or suspense. The large scale of ideas that are presented become siphoned by the rather narrow scope that director Carl Schultz fails to overcome creatively. We are only ever allowed to see the aftermath of each disaster, but we never witness the actual onslaught or destruction as they occur. What we are left with, instead, is Moore's character wading through a long series of discoveries that are as bland and predictable as they are tiresome. Jrgen Prochnow plays the only memorable role as the mysterious wanderer, David Bannon, with passable performances from Michael Biehn and Peter Friedman, as well. The final reveal in the end will come as little surprise, and offers even less logic or explanation. Only fans of other religious thrillers like THE PROPHECY or STIGMATA will find any interest here.  -Carl Manes I Like Horror Movies
0 ||| Just read the review posted by "century19@worldnet.att.net" below.  He hits it perfectly. There are some films that try to be something MORE than they are.  B-Movies are awful,  everyone knows it.  Movies like Iron Eagle, Red Dawn, Batman & Robin, and Alien:  Resurrection are trying to be something they are not; attempting to be  better than they actually are by throwing more money at it, casting bigger  stars, rewriting the already confusing script to cover the plot holes, or  just painting the screen with violence and explosions so they can get the  male crowd to buy the ticket.  This film is rife with so many alarming  problems that make you wonder how funding for it got off the ground.  But,  it was mid-eighties and the Cold War, so we needed flicks that flexed the  American military might and insulted Middle Eastern countries.  This film  is an embarassment to the US Air Force (yes, I am a member) and is  characteristic of America's skewed prejudice of Middle Eastern countries.  The generalized depiction of these people is abhorrent and frankly very  embarassing to watch.  No wonder America seems to not understand that  region of the world.  We take movies more at face value than we should.  If  you want to kick back and just watch it and veg, fine.  Just don't think  it's a realistic and deep film.  It isn't. Easily the top film on my  list as the worst ever.  Funny thing is, if it's on, I watch it so I can  amuse myself by ripping it apart.  I guess you could watch it for the  flying sequences.  But, if you're going to do that, why don't you just buy  a video on military aircraft then. Leonard Maltin said it, "not  boring, just stupid."  No kidding.  The DVD would make a good  frisbee...
0 ||| This movie is such a mishmash of nonsense that I could not watch it to the end but turned it off part way througgh. I found the character Demi Moore played repulsive, doing illogical things, illegally entering the room of the renter & examining his things, etc. I have read and studied the Bible for over 40 years & am well acquainted with what it says concerning the end times when God judges the world.  Opinion here was presented as fact among other things. There is nothing in the Bible of which I am aware that indicates a baby can be born without a soul - soul-less - & be alive. A body without a soul is dead physically. Such a baby is referred to as stillborn. This movie is just confusion & chaos. There are apocalyptic movies that make sense but this is not one of them. It is a total waste of time
1 ||| I remember seeing this as a kid and thinking wow how scary? and seeing it again thinking the same,but I take issue with(SPOILER,if you Have not seen it,do not read further)The Priest being portrayed in the utmost negative light,GodForbid the Rabbi or some Moslem is portrayed like that in Hollywood. The whole end of the world thing reminds me of the "Left Behind" stuff from Protestant sects and how they take advantage of Revelations,the way God is portrayed as a Vengeful God A-la Old Testament,it seems to be like a typical Protestant taking advantage like they do with Sola Scripture. The movie itself is not bad nor does it seem to be blasphemous(I could be wrong),the acting and Jesus seems very intense,But nobody knows when the End of the world is they say not even the Son.
2 ||| Released in 1988, "The Seventh Sign" is a creative take on the Bible's end-of-the-world prophecies: Apocalyptic judgments seem to be occurring all over the world as an unbelieving California couple (Demi Moore and Michael Biehn) are preparing for their first child. A mysterious stranger rents an apartment from them and Demi slowly discovers that she and her baby are the focal point of the end or possibly humanity's second chance.  Jesus Christ Himself is one of the main characters and this is one of the best depictions of Christ in film, if not THE best. He's by far the most interesting character in the movie (I'd tell you the actor playing the role but I don't want to give away who the Messiah is as the movie keeps it kinda discreet, not that it's too hard to figure out). I just wish they gave JC more screentime and dialogue since he's so intriguing; it would have made for a much more compelling picture. As it is, the film focuses on Demi and she's just not that interesting a character.  I enjoy movies that make you reflect and try to figure out. This is such a film. Some have criticized that the story is nonsensical, but it's all there clear as a bell if you reflect on it.  One reviewer criticizes that the film lacks substance, yet the story deals with nothing less than the salvation of humanity via sacrifice, faith, hope and love; plus Jesus Christ Himself is a major character. I think this qualifies as substance.  If you're having trouble figuring the story out ask yourself this question: Why is Jesus Christ attracted like a magnet to Demi and her baby? Once you have that figured out the story makes perfect sense.  I'd also like to point out that the film is expertly made on practically every level. This ain't no low-budget fare.  People seem to have trouble categorizing "The Seventh Sign" because it's so unique. I would say it's a mystery/horror film, but don't think "horror" in the sense of a slasher flick, "Seventh Sign" is more classy than that. Although there's loads of dead bodies and blood there's hardly any cussing and no youths getting naked.  As far as Biblical eschatology goes, the story gets it fairly accurate up to a point but then takes a creative turn. If such creative license with Christian prophecy offends you then stay away. Regardless, keep in mind that the main message of the film is completely Biblical, i.e. salvation only comes via the spilling of blood and faith, hope & love.  Unfortunately the film has a bit of a tedious vibe despite the numerous intriguing aspects, which is a major flaw considering it only runs about 90 minutes. Again, they should have given JC more screentime and dialogue as he is definitely the most interesting character. Because of this tedious vibe I give the film an overall strong 3/5 Stars or C+ (if I was in a better mood I'd give it a weak 4/5 Stars or B-). In other words, although "The Seventh Sign" has some undeniably great elements, overall it's neither great nor horrible; it's somewhere inbetween. Regardless, it's very worthwhile if the subject matter piques your interest.
2 ||| This came out I think around the time time as Top Gun.  And was overshadowed by it.  You just have to watch the movie.  It's good on it's ow.  You just have to tell yourself it's just a movie.  Because most of the plot is unbelievable,  The acting by Lou Gossett Jr. is good.  And I just watched Executive Decision yesterday.  And David Suchet is a good as a terrorist.
1 ||| Movie 6 of 1976 and 37 overall in my journey through films of my lifetime.  I have had my eyes on this one for years. In fact so many 70's films exceeded my expectations that I wanted to buy it before I started 1976 to ensure it didn't go under the radar. I'm not disappointed with "Taxi Driver" it is precisely what I expected. I think what happened is over the years no one could give me a good reason to watch it. They just said it was great. All the effusive accolades amounted to vapid emotion to me. I want well thought out reasons why a movie is supposed to be good. I don't care who's in it, who directed it, or likes it, no movie gets a pass. If you aren't good then I'm going to say so and "Taxi Driver" is not good. It's boring and unfocused. First and foremost was the daunting burden of having to listen to that droning music for two hours. I don't care if the point was to task us with the mind set of Bickle or not that was just atrocious! It was the musical equivalent to having a pebble stuck in your shoe as you walk: it's there nagging you about how crappy it is and you can't get rid of it and it does nothing other than be crappy and annoying. Completely ruined the movie for me. Now according to the composer it was a reflection of the main character's thoughts and mind set. Well there is an evolution of thought so why did the music remain static? I don't care about the great movies Herrmann had done before,  he did an awful job. It lacked creativity to me. I know the guy is in a cab all night long,  alone, night after night, so what? Is that worthy of any music that would reflect it? How about music that hints at the tedium without being tedious? I understand that Scorsese could have perhaps chosen other songs, I don't really care, just a mess in my opinion. "Taxi Driver" lacked focus. There was an interesting glimmer of thought where Bickle would judge those who might have been upstanding (Shepard) and worked to redeem those whom might have been considered "scum." I also liked the idea that there is a thin line between hero and villain that plays out. It was just too long of a meandering journey to get there. One of Scorsese's biggest strengths needs to be tempered. He is incredibly aware of the camera's effect on the audience. The way we see only DeNiro's torso then the camera springs up suddenly to his head to reveal his Mohawk was jarring and very well done. The violence at the end was incredibly effective, I was jaw dropped. It couldn't save the story for me though and I wondered if this was a crutch for an otherwise bland ending. I do think the theme of hero/villain was movie worthy, that is to say there was a good point to the story but it just wasn't enough for me. In the end I think "Taxi Driver" was just overrated as far as I'm concerned.  Pros -DeNiro is great -Foster's story line is interesting and compelling -theme has weight -Superb camera work Cons -boring mainly due to the music
2 ||| "Taxi Driver" is a character study more than a story. I can believe that Paul Schrader wrote the screenplay in a fever dream while living in his car: it's mostly about a state of mind, the main character's loneliness and rage. All the other plot details were probably added after the fact. Complementing the script, Robert De Niro buries himself in the part more than in any other film of his career.  The film frequently feels nervewracking because of how deeply it sees into the protagonist's mind. A few words into De Niro's "Listen up, you screw-heads" speech, there is a curious jump-cut and the speech starts over from the beginning. But it's not some avant-garde film device, it's pure reality -- for someone like Travis Bickle, every internal monologue is a rehearsal, he is always imagining himself as an action hero, always playing a scene out in his head, thinking of cooler versions of his "lines" and revising them in mid-delivery. The famous "you're talking to me?" line is actually part of a long series of threats that Travis makes to an invisible enemy while posing in front of a mirror with his guns.  In his isolation, Travis can only function in his rare social interactions by relying on cues from previous events. For example, he asks the arms dealer for a specific type of gun, but he first learned the name of that gun only a few days ago when it was mentioned by one of his clients. This completely random event allows him to appear knowledgeable about guns, but really he knows nothing about the type (and ends up buying all of them). Psychologically, this is a fine nuance, one of the things that shows how well the film-makers feel their character. It also contradicts the formal plot of the film -- as a war veteran, wouldn't Travis have picked up some information about firearms? (More importantly, wouldn't he at least have picked up rudimentary conversational skills from the guys in his platoon?)  But the film-makers don't care about that. According to them, the Vietnam backstory was meant to highlight Travis' alienation from society, and I suspect they just didn't bother to think through plot consistency. For years, viewers have debated whether the ending (in which, ironically, Travis is hailed as a hero) was meant to be "real," or whether it only took place in Travis' head. But you might as well ask that question much earlier. Did the entire shoot-out ever really take place, or was it just part of Travis' action-hero fantasy? Did he really try to assassinate Palantine, or did he just fantasize about it, and then "revise" his fantasy to follow the more "romantic" storyline of rescuing the girl from the pimps? Did he really shoot the robber in the store? Was he ever even in Vietnam? If he self-importantly tells people that he's "doing some work for the government," why couldn't he make up a Vietnam background? Was his exercise regimen real, or did he just imagine himself holding his hand out over the gas burner? As many critics have pointed out, nearly every scene is told from Travis' point of view, so potentially any scene after the failed date could be the film's last moment of "reality."  It is intellectually interesting to think about things like that, but unfortunately it is also a weakness of the film. The film-makers had a character, but ultimately they didn't know what to do with him or say about him, or how to end their movie. The film is a perceptive profile of a psychological type that could easily snap and become a loose cannon. But where did he come from, how did he get this way? The film's only explanation is Vietnam, but we have seen many Travis-like characters on the news in recent years, and usually they are not veterans. And, more importantly, is there anything that should or could be done to reach out to people like Travis? Was there ever any way to help him? The ending side-steps this question with some stylized violence, and then glibly criticizes media sensationalism (for you see, they would have condemned Travis for shooting Palantine, but they praise him for slaughtering a bunch of criminals). It's hard to argue with that, but it's also pretty obvious, and doesn't shed any useful light on the main issue.
1 ||| Heard a lot about this movie.  Finally broke down and watched it.  I really didn't like it, It really didn't make any sense and it dragged to much for me.  I thought it was to slow and boring.
0 ||| Demi Moore's tortured screams of "Noooo! Noooo!" at the end of this garbage heap of a film were very appropriate, since that is exactly what I was thinking after realizing I had wasted 90 minutes of my life on this incomprehensible nonsense.
2 ||| OK teen movie
2 ||| Was Ok.
2 ||| Strange film
0 ||| A film that fails to overcome the fact that it stars Demi Moore.  Nonsensical hocus-pocus pseudo-biblical script. (Hint: pick up the Book of Revelations while you watch the flick, and see how much they get wrong.)  Awful acting, clanking dialogue.  Just drags on and on and on....
2 ||| THE SEVENTH SIGN  (USA - 1988)  Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision) Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Stereo  Carl Schultz' supernatural drama is a very low-key affair, despite its apocalyptic premise (the impending birth of a young woman's unborn child threatens to unleash God's Final Judgment on the world), but it establishes and maintains a genuine sense of impending doom all the way from the opening scenes in Haiti and the Negev desert in Israel, to an uncompromising climax in the execution chamber of an American jail.  It failed at the box-office, partly because it doesn't live up to its "Omen"-esque potential, and partly because it's simply too clever for mainstream acceptance. The dialogue is laden with resonant phrases and descriptions, and viewers will need to pay close attention to catch many of the appropriate references, all of which have a bearing on the characters and their quest for moral redemption. A small masterpiece, ripe for rediscovery.
2 ||| depressing
2 ||| A classic movie collector must have.
0 ||| Punk DeNiro should be  shunned by decent Americans. He wanted to be political so here WE are being political back. The only good flick he ever made was Ronin anyway.
2 ||| Overhyped and overrated.  Just ok.  Drags, tedious.
1 ||| I really enjoy the story of this movie,  I liked everything about it except all the cussing and taking the  Lord's name in vane.  This for me ruined the entire movie,  Even though I liked the plot and the characters in it, it is one that I am going to return.. I would have given 5 stars if the cussing and taking the Lord's name in vane wasn't in there.
2 ||| Just so so
0 ||| This is the best movie the Air Force has to offer??? A high school kid managing to steal an F-16????
0 ||| damaged dvd, did not play it until I had had it for a while, so just sucked it up as a loss
0 ||| Sorry but I'm glad I did not see this when it was released. DeNiro and Foster are awesome actors but not in this movie. Save your money and get one of their recent releases, much better.
0 ||| Maybe this film just doesn't age well. Or maybe it's just not very good. One star is too high.
1 ||| I can't believe it only in Full Screen! No widescreen version. I love the movie, but now that I have an HDTV....
0 ||| I was only 12-years-old when I saw Iron Eagle with my dad, who passed away 5 years ago, and it's one of the finest memories I'll ever have. It was an exciting movie, and I still love it to this day even if it's unrealistic. For people who moan and groan about movies all the time for not being plausible, especially movie critics, I say "just grow up!" Movies are supposed to be about entertainment. Leave it to the movies based on true stories to be the so-called plausible ones.  The reason I gave this review a 1-star rating is not because of the movie itself, but because of the horrible DVD. It's the only one available as far as I know here in the U.S. It's in "full screen" format, which means edited for old televisions and not in its original widescreen format. That, of course, means a lot of the picture is cut off. The so-called 5.1 surround sound is just as bad, with little detectable sound from separate audio channels. It's old, outdated, and is in serious need of a brand new DVD and hopefully Blu-Ray version sometime soon.
1 ||| Ahh, "Iron Eagle".  A classic of the 1980's Golan-Globus production mill.  With the current spate of historic/"current" military movies, it's sometimes good to see how Hollywood's come in trying to get the details right.  One can't do much better than using this flick as a baseline.  In case you aren't already familiar with this gem, Louis Gosset Jr. playing a reserve Air Force Colonel, and a teenage kid fly a mission inside an unnamed Arab country -OK I'll name it:  Libya- to rescue the kid's dad.  Pop gets shot-down when he's intercepted in international waters, but the US refuses to do anything more than diplomatic pressure.  The kid and Lou Gosset meet up when the kid's challenged to race the local bully with his PLANE while the bully's using his dirt bike.  Suffice it to say he wins and impresses his babe; he doesn't get his slot at the USAF Academy, though. You gotta take the bad with good I guess.  When the words on Dad get back to the family, this kid uses his base "network" to get access to imagery, enemy air defense data, and two F16s carrying a B52's worth of ordinance.  All of this being done by his friends exploiting the dim bulbs who are their parents, no less.  (If only strike planning was this easy.)  Of course, the kid has flown training missions with his dad, and has a boatload of simulator time, so he's a natural to fly the mission.  He convinces Gosset to go along with him, and his two-ship is on the way.  The flying scenes are nothing spectacular, with obviously Israeli F16s playing the good guys, and Kfirs (modified Mirages) acting as MiGs.  Cockpit scenes are completely the imagination of the set designer; I'm guessing he never was anywhere near a real aircraft.  These are especially dated now as many computer flight sims are pretty darn accurate in cockpit, flight, and combat models.  Anyway, lots of explosions on the way in, Lou gets hit and aborts and our hero must press on alone-go figure.  He manages to talk with the evil dictator directly and get his dad on the runway for him to land (!) and pick him up.  More silliness ensues as he launches weapons on the ground, taxi's out and takesoff.  He kills the bad guy and heads home to find Lou punched out and was rescued.  Rather than the prison sentence for espionage, and theft of government property that Lou, the kid, his pals and the idiots they exploited on base should've got, he gets his slot at the Air Force Academy.  The end.  Overall, I guess Lou's performance was fairly good, but everyone else performed at the grade-B level this flick is.  Note especially a very young Shawnee Smith as one of the kid's buds.  Worth seeing for laughs, and as a film version of a kid's pilot fantasy.
1 ||| I just finished the book, Killing Reagan and I wanted to see how a movie could make John Hinckley want to kill Reagan.  It did not have that effect on me.  It made me want to kill myself for a waste of two hours and 15 bucks.  I would not recommend the movie nor trying to figure out a crazy person's motivation.  I highly recommend the book Killing Reagan however.
0 ||| Movies like this are a disgusting tribute to the filth and perversion that seems to be prevalent in our major cities.  I wish I could "unsee" it.
1 ||| Bottle Rocket is a 1996 film starring a young Owen Wilson alongside his brother Luke Wilson.  It's possibly worth checking out for that fact alone, Owen especially looks different to his later self in movies, you've likely have seen.  The film was written by Owen along with Wes Anderson.  There isn't really much of a storyline though, basically the two brothers play best (or only) friends, Luke's character has been in a mental hospital, but he's clearly the more level headed of the two.  Owen's character wants to impress his former boss (James Caan, who he doesn't mention at first employed him as a landscaper), by robbing a from what I could tell public library.  There's no ingenious plan or anything, it just happens at one point in the film, and it's not that exciting.  Their getaway driver a rich kid, is constantly being bullied and beat up by his older brother.  They decide to lay low at a cheap isolated motor inn where their driver leaves to deal with his brother's demands.  So hence they are stuck there.  Luke's character becomes infatuated with a housekeeping woman who doesn't speak English, the only language he does while Owen's just sets off fire works and mopes around the place.  There's plenty of opportunities for humour with all the above scenarios but for some reason they didn't go there. In fact there really aren't any laughs in the film at all, the characters all act oddly the whole film but that's it, and that just makes the movie seem unrealistic.  If you're a huge Wes Anderson, or of either of the Owen brothers you might want to check Bottle Rocket out just so you can say you've seen everything they've been in/written, but if you're not, you're probably only going to be disappointed.  This is a pretty slow, boring and pointless film.  Could even have been something they were making for a university class or something.
0 ||| Stopped watching after just a few minutes.  Boring.
0 ||| Thought it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Stupid Stupid Stupid
1 ||| never grabbed me. love luke and owen but got lost in this one.
0 ||| I had never seen it before but was familiar with the plot.  What a horribly boring and slow movie, I got through it but would never recommend it to anyone.
1 ||| I recently re-viewed Taxi Driver to see if it might make a better impression than 30 years ago.  It didn't.  Scorcese's confounding lack of character development, a gratuitous and underdeveloped plot, grimy violence, and lurid musical score contribute to a sludgy mess that gained accolades over the years primarily due to its cutting edge approach to the subject matter.  Well, it's no longer 1976, and the decades gone by have not been kind to the film.  Truly great films transcend the times in which they were made, and Taxi Driver, with its mannered and one dimensional performances, suffers from a lack of emotional credibility.  We never witness Bickle's motivations or demons, instead viewing him as a two dimensional, socially inept caricature who can't handle male-female interaction. Then, almost spontaneously he obsesses on making a violent "big statement".  The dialog and plotting provides little insight into this tormented man's inner voices- Is he suffering PTSD? Is he the product of a terrible home situation? Where do the violent and anti-social tendencies come from? What are Bickle's primary motivations?  I'm incredulous as to how Taxi Driver has sustained its aura after all these years when it basically plays out like a low budget, violent melodrama with a tawdry and frankly unbelievable conclusion. If it wasn't for Jodie Foster's amazing portrayal of the world weary teenage prostitute, there'd be little reason to watch the film other than for curiosity's sake.
0 ||| enough said
1 ||| This is a well-known movie starring Robert De Niro, with Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd and other stars. De Niro is a lonely and depressed former Marine, now driving a taxi in N.Y.C. He pursues a hopeless relationship with a presidential campaign worker (entirely different backgrounds and interests), but does manage to save Jodie Foster from a continued life as a prostitute. He's hailed as a hero, encounters Cybill again as a fare, but nothing grows out of it. Too long, FAR too slow - boring.
0 ||| I really expected more out of this movie...  I guess I should have listened to the other reviews.  I kept waiting for it to get funny or interesting... I really wanted to like, in the end, it was a waste of 1-1/2hrs of my life.
1 ||| slow moving and boring
1 ||| Luke Wilson is a talented comic actor but you would never know that by watching this movie.  The jokes are stupid, the characters are idiotic and the story is just awful.
0 ||| Dreary movie and disjointed. Can't believe it was nominated for best picture!
0 ||| This is a classic example of self-important Hollywood congratulating itself. Don't be swayed by the pseudo-intellectual thumbs up garbage. De Niro's acting is phenomenal, but the story line, character development,( Jodi Foster gets top billing in the credits right after Di Nero, but does not really appear in the film well into it's second half,  the over the top music,( just listen to the score after everybody is dead, about 10 minuets before the end ). What is up with that? Most great directors make one or two horrible movies. This is Marty's absolute worst. Don't waste your time.
0 ||| Not worth my time
0 ||| I don't like it. bob
1 ||| Until now,i have never ever seen a W.A film I did not love and was surprsied when I not only did not like this one but actually found it boring and solopistic.  ah well, can't win them all!
1 ||| I didn't get to finish watching it!
0 ||| Boring.
1 ||| I thought it was really slow paced, and not too interesting
0 ||| boring
0 ||| TERRABLE PICTURE, VERY BORING
0 ||| I could only make it through 5 minutes. I'll never get those minutes back!
1 ||| Just plain lame. Not funny.
0 ||| What did they do to TAXI DRIVER? I was excited to order the 4K version. I immediately put it on my 4K Blu Ray player to watch on my new 70 inch 4K TV.  What a waste of time and money. I don't know what mastered copy of the film they used for this version, but it's a total bust. Grainy, no sharpness, even the colors seem slightly muted. DO NOT BUY. I'd return it, but can't since I've already opened the package.
1 ||| it was OK for free, sure glad I didn't pay for it. I don't like James Caan in the first place but I am very happy he only had a cameo. So we have boys who go to prison & the mental hospital get our, commit crimes and go back to same. In between one meets a nice Ecuadorian lady who looks like she just came from Spain. There is no discernable plot except crime doesn't pay.
1 ||| Too choppy
1 ||| Never quite got off the ground.  Pun intended.
0 ||| Didn't get it at all. Sucked
0 ||| I wouldn't know since I turned it off a while back.
1 ||| Just didn't capture  my interest at all. Sorry.
0 ||| Maybe it was because its nearly 20 years old and my expectations have changed since 1996.  Don't know, I watched about 20 minutes and got bored and turned it off.  I suspect a good review should be by a viewer watching the whole thing but I knew I would never get those minutes back so I cashed in and watched something else.  I don't feel compelled to write any further, read the other one-star reviews they mirror my feelings.
0 ||| I'm sorry I watched this movie, a complete waste of time. Actually it was my own fault for not knowing that Luke and Owen Wilson were involved in this sorry piece of cinematic trash. Two-dimensional characters, predictable  plot, sophomoric attempts at humor, and wooden acting combine to make this a movie to avoid.
1 ||| It was okay. We were disappointed in the humor and storyline.
0 ||| Poor everything
0 ||| Pace is too slow.  Normally I like the actors in this, but I just didn't get it.
0 ||| Not worth watching.  Turned it off!!
1 ||| Not one of the Owens brothers better efforts, ok to watch if you cant find anything else.
0 ||| We will not talk about the music, nor the acting, or the atmosphere from this movie so special .  A slow and boring movie that has no equivalent in France than the Samurai of JP Melville. Because yes! behind this slow and strange rhythm that is all oriented towards the final action lies a complex screenplay with a strong message extremely provocative !  So according to Mr Schrader it's like if Travis had more or less missed his real target by attacking the pimps. We could go further and say outright that real prostitutes are not the ones we think and the woman of the world ...  De Niro's eyes in the rearview mirror at the end of the film give us the strange feeling that the killer still doesn't understand the gravity of his action but he would even be ready to start again in devilishly gigantic proportions.  And all this for love ! (go figure ... real Dostoevsky !) To set free woman from this servile leech called man.
1 ||| This movie had some humor but overall was a waste of time.  Kind of pointless
0 ||| Sort of classic Owen Wilson but wasn't good enough to finish.
0 ||| This movie was terrible from beginning to end.
0 ||| Not mental stimulation
0 ||| It is for younger 20-30 age group. Not our taste in movies.
1 ||| Not too good.
0 ||| STUPID !
1 ||| Total disappointment and really sucked.  I expected better from Owen Wilson.
0 ||| this movie sucks. i thought this was going to be compelling but it wasn't at all. it was quite dull and unwatchable. i turned it off five minutes into the flim
0 ||| Tiresome, relentlessly unfunny comedy, aboiut stupid people doing stupid things.
0 ||| really dumb...don't waste your time or be fooled by positive reviews!
0 ||| What a complete waste of film,This ranks right up there with Man on the moon  (Jim C) love the actor hate the movie , 2015 Hopefully we will see better movies this year ,a few good ones for 2014 . But what ever happen to the movies ? Its been years since i have saw a really good movie , well i recently watched a movie Miss Potter ,loved it .
1 ||| I wish Wes could go back in time and re-do this one.
0 ||| Stupid movie.
1 ||| This was a pretty so-so movie and boring.  These guys make better movies.  They need better stories or screen writers.
1 ||| Thought it was going to be a charming funny go round with the "boys"... bored the heck out of me. Had to fast forward a couple times. Poor editing maybe. Silly comes to mind. Simple minded..another... and I like all of the actors. Something not happening for me.
1 ||| I think Luke Wilson wrote this so he could stand in front of the camera and talk. Amazing how many people love to do that (YouTube).
0 ||| I gave up after a few minutes.  I have no clue what this was supposed to be about but it was obviously crap.  Couldn't take more than about 10 minutes.
1 ||| When it was new, I didn't go see it because I was told it was pretty violent. Then when Hinkley did his thing "to impress Jodi Foster," I was even more turned off. I had seen some still photos of Foster in her baby whore costume, and admit to having been a bit curious as to what really was involved and how she handled it. That one star up there is for her.  It's violent, it's depressing, and in the end, it's pretty incomprehensible. I'm still trying to figure the point of the story. If any of you remember it and liked it, feel free to explain it to me.
1 ||| I rent yesterday here in Brasil  the Blu-ray "Taxi Driver". A lot of shots has a good PQ but  there is a LOT of shots that the PQ is BAD !!! In Highdef Digest the reviwer  gave  5 stars for PQ ... I can't understand ! I have a Infocus 1080p and old movies in BD like  "2001", "The Shining" and others looks GREAT !!! "Taxi Driver" is a deception ... Sometimes looks like a so so DVD !!!
0 ||| The three minute gun fight at the end was interesting and had pretty good special effects but other than that the whole movie was just boring. I really expected I'd like this since it had such great reviews and Deniro and Scorsese usually don't disappoint but that was not the case this time. It's just an hour and forty-five minutes of nothing. Is pointing out that New York has alot of bad areas and bad people suppose to be some kind of stroke of genius? And so what if a New York Cab Driver starts to slowly lose his mind.  There just wasn't anything interesting or dramatic about any scene, aside from the gun fight. And the music was god awful.
0 ||| Three friends get together for petty burglary jobs. They are pretty inept. One of them, Anthony (Owen Wilson), just got out of an mental institution but seems much more sane than the manic Dignan (Luke Wilson). Anthony falls in love with a motel maid, Inez.  Personally, I though this was a disconnected movie wih a very slim plot. I didn't care for this at all.  For what it's worth I thought Owen Wilson looked like a young Dennis Hopper with a broken nose in this film. It's the haircut that Wilson has in this film, a crew cut.
1 ||| As usual, I do not write my reviews to get agreement since 95% or more of the population does NOT know what is good from bad, pearl to a swine.  You know how you watch old movies and now, even when you watch them again, you still tend to rate them high due to memories of watching them when you were younger and feeling the obligation to remain faithful to how you felt?  That's how this movie is. It's an oldie with good acting and whatnot, but I did not enjoy it very much because of the following reasons:  SPOILER ALERT!!! INTENDED MAINLY FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE WATCHED THE MOVIE OR PEOPLE THAT DON'T GIVE A BLANK.  In no specific order:  1. The guy gets ready and does all this training to, in the end, kill 3 or 4 low life losers, some of which were not armed and even tried not to provoke him? The basically provoked them and acted like some sort of tough guy. The whole movie sets you up, making you sort of think that he was going after big game aka the possible presidential candidate when the whole time, after all the training he's done....he took out 3 low-life's, which by the way sucks and made the ending really disappointing. It's like the whole plot revolves around the end where he kills those guys.  2. He goes and kills those guys and he's declared a hero without going to jail? Was that how it is back then? You go out and you kill bad guys and you not only DON'T go to jail....but treated as a hero? Doesn't make much sense to me, either that or times sure have changed. What he did was basically premeditated murder or mass murder.  3. The movie doesn't really make clear who the main character plans to take out and the main character never seems to do much research or investigation into his mastermind scheme....which I really felt to be completely coincidental due to that fact. So basically that part of the plot goes like this: He talks about how he dislikes the scums and low-life's of the city aka drug dealers, prostitution, etc etc. Then he trains with a few guns that he bought, then one day he just decides okay it's time to do it. Then he goes and kills three criminals. Again I bring up that he does not do any research into these guys or the movie never shows him do enough research to justify his final scenes. You're left confused till the very end and it's not a clever setup either.  4. There was a lot of useless scenes that did not assist with the ending scene. Scenes like: a) He fell in love with this blond, which dumped him. b) His hatred for the geek that keeps following the blond. c) The scenes with the other cab drivers, never really builds a relationship with them much and they do nothing to the story except make it longer. d) Scenes of him training, did he REALLLLLLY need to train to kill 3 guys???? Thought he was going to take out an army or something, totally anti-climatic. e) Most of the cab scenes, read the following below.  5. The movie, I felt, did not efficiently utilize and implicate his role as a taxi driver. Why do I feel this way? Because whatever he did and whatever he felt and whatever he knew, could have been done, felt, or known even without being a Taxi Driver. Let's go deeper. He drives around and notices all this crap in the street which makes him dislike the city more and wants to do something about it. You don't need to be in a taxi to feel this way or find out about this. A better way to implicate his role as a taxi driver to further help the plot of the story would be him spying on bad guys or getting important information as a taxi driver, using his taxi driving identity to somehow sneak into certain places and acting as a spy, etc.  Thinking back on that movie, the only spying he really did was probably with the presidential candidate that coincidentally got into his cab and talking to him, but even that I felt was useless. And this scene alone confuses the plot, not help clarifies anything. He knows nothing of the guy, how can he be a supporter?  So what? He feels sorry for one prostitute and helps her get free and he's a hero? What the heck? What about those other hundreds or thousands of other prostitutes? It's like if I went out and adopted a single cat at the pound and ran around calling myself a savior. CRAP!!  The acting was good, but the movie, IMO, is not that great. It was probably a good oldie, but a present day analysis makes the movie not so good at all.
0 ||| A man applies for a job as a taxi driver because he can't sleep nights. [Remember `Checker' cabs?] He comments on the people who come out at night. Travis visits a theater and eats junk food. He can't sleep. We see a campaign office at work. [Does the film drag here?] The cab drivers gossip. The conversation drags, and so does the film. [Is this a parody of campaign workers?] Do they have anything in common? "You need to clean up this city." "It's not going to be easy." A young woman meets his cab. Travis and Betsy go to a movie. Does it have a plot? [Is this meant as a joke?] Another strange bearded passenger talks to Travis. Is he sick? [Is this Martin Scorsese?] Does Travis make sense? The film drags on.  There is a near accident. Travis meets a salesman who makes house calls to display his wares. Are the prices reasonable? [Is this a parody?] Is Travis stalking somebody? Was that ZIP code correct? Is Travis going insane because of a lack of sleep? Does anyone notice? There is an attempted robbery of a small store. [Believable?] The film drags on. "No rough stuff." There is a failure to communicate. Is this a parody? Iris has a new friend. Is the conversation pointless? And the film drags on. There is a political rally at Columbus Circle. Does somebody stand out like an odd haircut? Travis runs off to do what he has to do. There is a violent shoot-out that should wake up those who dozed off. And so it ends, a tale full of sound and fury signifying nothing.  The last scene seems tacked on for the happy ending needed for commercial success. Is it believable? It just goes to show that a good plot is needed for a good story.
1 ||| Other reviewers compared this movie with Rushmore and Kevin Smith's work (Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma, etc). Those are some of my favorite movies so I figured I would like this one as well. I didn't, and it took me a while to figure out why. They're all quirky, all dialog heavy, all off-beat. So what's wrong with Bottle Rocket? In the other movies, the main characters are more intelligent than everybody else. That is not the case in Bottle Rocket. All the main characters are unbelievably boneheaded. I had high hopes, and just couldn't get myself to care about the characters. In a movie like this, if you don't care about the characters, there's nothing left. Lots of people loved it. Maybe you will too. I couldn't get into it.
0 ||| I really wanted to like this, but just like "The Royal Tenns." and "Rushmore" it did not do it for me somehow.  You know the feeling where you keep waiting for the good part?  And waiting...and waiting.  I would only recommend this to you if you are a huge Wilson brother fan and really do not care what they are doing or look like.  They don't do much in this film and don't ever look great.  If you are a close and personal friend of anyone involved in making this mess, go ahead and rent it.  If not, steer clear.
0 ||| Bad acting, lame story and very poor execution. It could have been good if carried out right but it moves too slowly. The dialogue doesn't make much sense and it's like Martin was just killing film time by having the actors talk slowly so they had less to write. Nothing brilliant about this film, 1/5
0 ||| My friend recommended this movie to me and said it was the funniest movie ever.  Boy was she wrong!  This movie has no plot and is in no way funny.  The only feelings I had for this movie after I was finished watching it was sympathy for actors because it might ruin their careers.  I can't recommend this movie to anyone.  You can, if you really hate that person.
1 ||| Not that Crime and Punishment was happy but the film and the book are undeniably similar. From the isolation felt by the protagonists, to the heroic child prostitutes.   The film is compelling there is no doubt of that but is that a good thing? With a book like Crime and Punishment where the character murders, the author at least shows the consequences of such a deed both inwardly and in the world.   With Taxi Driver the climax is the violence, it is the insanity. An insane man saying 'you talking to me' is cool and funny. Travis is the hero, an insane man who murders and tries to assasinate people is looked up to and idolized. Thats a hallmark of Scorcese films and why I don't like a lot of his work. He shows the seductiveness and romanticism of satanic actions and people, but brings too much sympathy to them, too much idolization. Instead of showing the real consequences of these dark impulses, Scorsese seems to be infatuated with them and splashes them pornographically across the screen for his own amusement.   This film is seductive yes, but certainly unhealthy.
1 ||| Didn't see this movie back in the 70's, and never intended to until I recognized that a lot of Amazon reviewers compared "One Hour Photo" (a film I thought was excellent) with "Taxi Driver". So I relented and eagerly viewed the DVD, only to berate myself for having been duped.  Briefly - "Taxi Driver" is the story of Travis Bickle, an ex-Marine turned NYC cab driver; a young man who "means well" but is a macho character with s*** for brains (kind of like the creators of this movie, I'm sorry to say). Anyone who hasn't sense enough not to take a woman to a smutty movie loses my interest and sympathy pretty quickly. Bickle is his own worst enemy; he doesn't have the patience or wherewithal to apply himself to get educated, etc. to make life better for himself and others. He just wants life to improve, NOW! OK, sure. So he instigates some bloodshed and death, and somehow sometime winds up a sort-of hero. HUH?  I tried to get some insight on the HUH? part by viewing the "documentary" section of the DVD, but I just couldn't muddle all the way through it. It was full of nothing but ego-driven minutiae; details about stuff no sane person would care about (yawn), so I gave up and will happily dispatch the DVD back to the Public Library today and wash my hands of it. The End.  PS What WAS interesting however, is the fact that this movie was made back when parts of NYC were so blighted that one could buy a Park Avenue co-op for the price (in today's $$$) of a used car. One of my relations did just that.
0 ||| Scorsese grew up amidst violence and bloodshed.  That he is able to reproduce murder and mayhem so realistically is an achievement that deserves one star.  The rest of the film, with its hookers, pimps, and contrived direction is really not worth mentioning.  A perfect example of intense violence mistaken for great artistic expression.  "Taxi Driver" is, quite simply, not nearly as good as "enlightened" cinephiles make it out to be.
0 ||| If I could I will not giving any star, it's an horrible movie.  Robert Deniro is terrible in it, he gets on my nerves, Cybil Shepard is annoying, only Jodie Foster seem fresh and interesting but we don't saw her much.  To much violence for nothing and awful cheezy music.  It was soooo boring.
0 ||| I must have missed something. With all the lovely words of the previous reviewers of this film, you would think that this is the film of the century. Sorry, but no, it's not. It's not even in the top 1,000. There was nothing about this film that should appeal to anyone looking for entertainment. The greatest emotion you'll realize while watching this film is shear boredom. "Taxi Driver" changes gears so many times you really don't know where this film is heading. It makes so little sense and De Niro's performance is so uneven, you don't know if he's doing it on purpose or he's just a bad actor. A good date film? No, it will kill the mood. A comedy? You may laugh once but probably unintentionally. An adventure? Only if you consider watching the trials and tribulations of a wacked out taxi driver adventurous. This film is all over the place and it never lets you get a grip on what the director is trying to tell you. Oh sure, now, they tell you that it's a genius of a film but while you're watching it you'll swear that the writer and director were using illicit substances while making this nonsense. Anyone that can't write a screenplay at least as good as this in one day, simply isn't trying very hard. This movie is a tragic waste of time and your wife or girlfriend will leave the room while you sit there hoping it's going to get better. Well, guess what. It won't get better and you shouldn't even spend one second giving any thought to renting or buying this over-hyped, over-acted lobotomy of a film.
0 ||| I find it hard to believe that so many people are able to enjoy this movie.  Though not particularly long, it seems to drag by, and Scorsese doesn't help by leaving so much dead time, it turns into a graveyard, literally and metaphorically.  The theme is poorly conveyed, the plot is vapid and nonsensical, and the acting is fairly sub-par.  The characters are barley there, and their lack of development and history really adds to the convoluted plot.  In the end, it turns into an average testosterone driven shoot-out, leaving you angry and confused.  This, next to "Runaway Bride" and "Home Alone" is the worst movie I've ever seen.
0 ||| Apparently a film classic about a Vietnam veteran who becomes a taxi driver and then lets himself be broken down by the misery and the meaninglessness of modern society.  Seen with Year 2000 eyes, Taxi Driver does not have a great deal of appeal. It has purely historical value.  The best things you can say about this film is the very beautiful filming, plus that it is interesting to watch very young Robert DeNiro's and even younger Jodie Foster's already then great talents. You also get glimpses of Harvey Keitel.  Do watch Taxi Driver, 'cause it is one of those classics that you have to have seen. But don't expect too much.
1 ||| Maybe this was great in the 80's, but now it's just cliche. Not even charmingly so. For when this was made, there are some good special effects work, not by todays standards, but back then, impressive.
1 ||| I grew up on horror films in the 80's, and evaluating them now has proven to be a bit of a mixed bag. Some, like Nightmare on Elm Street, are every bit as gripping and fascinating as I remember them. Some, however, have suffered in the interim. Fright Night is still a fun movie, overall, but it has not dated very well. The music, the look of it, is all very very 80's. The effects are good, but nothing spectacularly better then other films of the time. And none of the actors are putting their best foot forward. Roddy McDowell and another actor share a scene near the end that does manage to capture some real pathos, but other then that it's all too campy, with writing and plot that doesn't support that choice. Camp acting in a dark and serious plot is just not a good mix.
1 ||| I am amazed that this film gets so many positive reviews. I love horror films, and I want them to be scary, frightening, etc. I'm not a big fan of the horror comedy genre. There are a few good ones. But, this is not one of them. This is simply a bad comedy, and there are no real jokes here -- just kind of "stupid comedy": the characters constantly simply act stupidly, and that is supposed to be funny. There is nothing clever here. There is no believable character, with the exception of Roddy MacDowell. He is the one saving grace, and his professional acting ability shines way above the rest. He is playing a comically "reluctant" vampire killer, who doesn't really believe in vampires but plays a vampire killer in his films and on TV. Now he has to actually kill a vampire, after he finally comes to believe they are real. Thankfully, Roddy MacDowall is in this film. But the plot, the other actors, the "jokes" are really bad. The special effects are mostly consisting of "melting faces", and were done on the cheap. Good special effects for the time and for a low budget -- but, not very good for scaring the audience. At the time this was made (1985) perhaps it deserved good reviews as a send-up of horror films. But, it really does not stand the test of time, in my opinion.  There is a remake (2011) that actually is fairly good.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fright-Night/dp/B003Y5H5FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fright Night</a>. Much better than the original. Still mixes comedy and horror, but the special effects are very good, and the comedy is less obtrusive and more effective.
0 ||| It's such a shame that this classic, campy horror movie can only be enjoyed by the super rich with a limited release by Twilight Time aka Screen Archives Entertainment.  I've noticed a number of studios framing out distribution to other distributors who jack up the prices and only print a limited number of copies. It's a shame the majority of fans can't enjoy them.
1 ||| No one i repeat no one can say or not say that there ae rules for punk rock. Punk is not what you wear it's not anarchy it's not something you can call yourself by having a mowhawk!!! it's a way of life it's an expression it is something that has been ruined by the media and hollywood. This has to be the most ignorant movie i have ever seen, and if people actually buy into it than thats their own fault. I was briefly entertained, but the simple fact that steve-o has set rules to be a punk rocker is bull-sh*t. I cant have a girfriend im a punk rocker. I can't be a sellout, so that means i can't like english bands?Rules are for your so called establishment, not for an anarchist. This movie is a giant oxymoron. Just the fact that steve-o comes from an upper class family contradicts his own moronic beleifs. go out and watch into  hell. If there ever was an acturate interpretation of the punk movement this is it. Or you could go to Hot topic and buy this movie and join the throngs of other people that actually believed it.
0 ||| I could not finish seeing this, made no sense at all. And Milla does not even seem to be the protagonist.
1 ||| Pretty cheesy
0 ||| If I could best describe this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it yet, "SLC Punk," is just plain stupid. This was one of the highly anticipated films that was released at "The Sundance Film Festival" in Park City, UT, a couple years back. Alas, there's virtually no plot, and no good dialouge. The incessant use of the "F-word" in SLC Punk - gets really old after a while - it made me want to cringe! Why couldn't the director of the movie go by the adage that "less is more." There's a lot of meaningless subtext, and a bunch of cavorting teenagers, who like to "go-against-the-grain." It authentically portrays the SLC Punk scene: you know, the spiked hair, mohawks, plenty of black leather and body piercings. It's about a bunch of young aspiring punk-rockers (anarchists/mallrats) - who at times - border on suicidal tendencies; where there's lots of drug-use; and the main characters making total jackasses out of themselves. Being from the SLC area, I was expecting a scintillating perfomance from these guys. (I wish they could've behaved themselves, in a dignified manner.) IT WAS FILMED IN UTAH, OF ALL PLACES! I THOUGHT IT WAS SO AWESOME! I saw some familiar scenes in SLC Punk: the [Mormon] Temple, the University of Utah Campus, and West High School. SLC Punk, wasn't what I was expected. I was so stoked about this movie from the beginning - and then all of a sudden - my excitment died down. I love punk music, through and through. It's just that, this movie came up way short. I didn't, however, get to see SLC Punk at the film festival, which is why I picked it up at the video store. This movie was so disappointing. There's not a whole lot I can say about SLC Punk, other than I think it's a complete waste of time and money. This movie is rated [R] for: Profanity, Vulgarity, Drug Use, Teen Partying, and Violence. All things condsidered, I wouldn't recommend seeing it.
1 ||| After fighting her way through the tunnels of the Umbrella Corporation's Hive, Alice finds herself in the middle of Raccoon City's zombie outbreak!  I binged on the Resident Evil films this weekend and while the series is strong this one is fairly weak.  It marks a transition from an older style with practical special effects and conventional film making to the more stylized films that followed.  And the result is, even though this film is from 2004, it often feels like a low-middle budget films from the 80s.  The zombies are just extras with dirt smeared on them walking slowly.  The final monster looks and moves like a guy in a rubber suit.  The secondary characters are one dimensional 'jive talking black dude', 'tough chick' etc.  It's OK as part of the series but not as tense as the first film nor as over-the-top as the later ones.  I'd recommend instead seeking out the 5 film boxed set, this is much more acceptable as part of a longer series.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Resident-Evil-Resdent-Evil-Afterlife-Resident-Evil-Apocalypse-Resident-Evil-Extinction-Resident-Evil-Retribution-Set/dp/B01FFQJGMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Resident Evil / Resdent Evil: Afterlife / Resident Evil: Apocalypse / Resident Evil: Extinction / Resident Evil: Retribution - Set</a>
0 ||| When I've read and have heard all these positive reviews for this gigantic turkey I just can't believe my eyes or ears! I mean has anybody even read any of the comic books?! Well I have and FYI they were a lot more clever than this trash. I just don't see that this movie took any cues from the comic nor is it even as well written!! The cheesey attempts at humor were completely embarrassing as jokes/humor(if You call it that) felt like it was written by a 12 year old!! The comics that I read for Fright Night didn't meddle in worthless jokes and in general made them poignant. It wasn't just about dumb laughs for no real reason such as this turd of a movie possessed. I found William Ragsdale's performance as Charlie Brewster to be dorky! And needless to say he was alot better on Herman's Head. Chris Sarandon was not only very inconsistant in his laughable performance as vampire Jerry Dandridge but he was neither funny nor clever! To say nothing of that scene where one moment he's telling Charlie Brewster that he would give him a chance to forget all about him and what he knows then the next he's strangling him while trying to push him out the window. My gosh are they sure this is a comedy? 'Cause that was a crude moment. Anyway I liked Chris alot better in Child's Play a few years later. Amanda Bearse in a Pre-Married With Children role as Charlie's love interest was a forgivable enough performance despite her not giving it her all! Whoever that really annoying dork was that played Ed/Evil Ed he was just too unbearable and not very funny. The only thing he did that would even remotely pass as funny was his poor attempt to try and fly out a window appearing to fall. I'm sorry but there just isn't any excusing this bucket of vomit at all! Needless to say Roddy McDowell should just stick with Planet of the Apes! He just tried too hard in his half-a**ed performance as Peter Vincent. Anyhoo if you want to see a real vampire comedy I recommend you try Vampire in Brooklyn,Once Bitten, or even My Best Friend's a Vampire and stay away from this eye cancer on celluloid all together!
1 ||| We laughed at the stupidity of this show.
0 ||| SLC Punk is a complete waste of time and talent.  Matthew Lillard gives a  really good performance as an anarchist going through some major life  changes, but the rest of this film is a waste.  Way too much hokey  philosophy and hackneyed visual shots by a third rate cinematographer.  The  soundtrack is great--Sex Pistols, Fugazi, Specials, even a little Rush at  the end.  But Heroin Bob played by Goorjian is completely overacted and  ridiculous, he ruins every scene he is in with his inadequacies.  One other  thing, will someone please get the acid trip right.  The director of this  film has chosen to go the traditional Easy Rider acid trip route which is a  total wreck.  I'd love to see just once an accurate portrayal of LSD  consumption on the big screen (check out Fear and Loathing).  This movie is  for posers, I caught it on HBO at 2:00 in the morning so luckily I didn't  waste any cash on it.  But if your into a mindless story with an aimless  plot that leads nowhere then check out SLC Punk.
1 ||| Wanna be punk kids. Small town america. Rich boy with a big mohawk. Angst. Angst. More Angst.  Its Like Greg Araki lite. Great blue hair and super soundtrack but...it lacks something... Hmmmm...This movie could be best  described as 50% My Own Private Idaho (only punk and not gay), 30% Fast  Times At Ridgemont High (only post High School and Punk, not new wave) and  20% "lets hook it up with a punk soundtrack and the kids will love  it". I was kinda depressed by this movie. Maybe it hit too close to  home and I felt like I know 10 people who could have easily been Stevo.  There were some scenes in the flick that I really laughed at...The doctor  visit at the start of the film, the convience store incident, Stevos talk  with his mom and dad about law school. But mostly I just didn't believe  Matthew Lillard as a punk. Maybe that's the point. Im not sure. The ending,  I felt, was contrived and just silly. And the fact that the movie seems to  be trying to say that "all punks have to grow up" just makes me  shiver and laugh. This movie is worth a rental but Im not sure about buying  it. hmmm. I wouldn't buy it but I wouldnt laugh at you if you did... I  would suggest maybe checking Greg Araki out before you slap your money down  for this flick.
1 ||| I love horror movies. I love black Comady, but "Fight Night" had very annoying character's in it. Their's a big difference between funny and annyoing, but not the case of "Fright Night". The Vampire in "Fright Night" is [bad] when he trys to be funny and very laughable when he trys be scary. I am suprised on how much of a hit "Fight Night" actully became. I still suggest you rent this before you buy.
1 ||| ehh
1 ||| It isn't one of the great works of film, although there is a possibility it could wind up as a MST3K-esque feature at an indie theater's midnight camp classic showing.  Mutated dogs, a paraplegic zombie crawling up the pants leg of a baddie, the Juggernaut...er...somebody's boyfriend or other made into a hulking commando version of the turd from "Weird Science...this movie enjoys a certain...well...it's pretty unique, you have to give it that much.  It doesn't seem to have that much in common with the original game save for some key words, names and zombie tropes.  However, with enough beer, Mountain Dew, nachos and couch sharing with your own versions of Joel, Tom Servo and Crow the sins of this movie can be absolved for about 90 minutes worth of head scratching (plot and subplot distinction, wherefore art thou?) and (probably unintentional) laughs..
0 ||| Good pacing, great atmosphere, but I'm not a fan of the acting or the way some of the acting sequences are presented.
0 ||| Just not that great.
0 ||| This movie series is an abomination and if you come across any copies please make sure to burn them. A bunch of people making a resident evil movies who have never even played the games. Oh the irony. I bet George A. Romero would've done a much better job. Point is, if you don't know the source material you're basing your work on don't base your work on it.
0 ||| I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil video game series and zombie movies. Now, while I could start off this review criticizing the movie for having almost nothing to do with the games, I won't because that is the least of this movies problems. If you've ever wondered why video game movies suck, look no further than Resident Evil.  Every problem that a video game movie has ever had is here. A thin plot, bad acting, lazy directing, crappy dialouge, bad effects, I think you get my point. Now, as with most video game movies, the flaws I mentioned about were to be expected and I figured that the movie would at least have some good zombie action. I couldn't have been more wrong! The action in this film is so bag it's almost laughable. Most of the action consist of generic shoot em up scenes and slow motion martial arts type fighting with Milla Jovovich. Thanks to the lazy directing of Paul W.S Anderson, the film is incredibly boring and every scene consist of the same repetitive set up. Characters walk slowly through hallway, predictable zombie jump scare, characters kill zombie, repeat. It grows tiresome fast and I wanted to shut the movie off about halfway through I was so bored. While watching, I was actually shocked by the fact that these movies actually have a pretty big fan-base of people who actually think the story here is good and the characters are interesting. The only positive things I can say about the movie is that it does have a good setup and Mila Jovovich looks hot as hell.  Despite most of them being duds, I do believe it's possible to make a good video game movie. Resident Evil however, is only going to convince people that it's more impossible than it was before.
1 ||| As it is the case with most sequels, this second instalment of "Resident Evil" franchise is significantly inferior to the first film. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILLERS.  This film begins 30 days after the contamination of the Hive described in the first "Resident Evil" movie. In opening scenes the Umbrella Corporation attempts to unseal the Hive in order to eliminate its undesirable occupants and reclaim this huge, precious facility. It is suggested that this attempt doesn't go very well... Some days later Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in an abandoned hospital in Raccoon City, naked, bruised and unable to remember jack... And then the film really begins.  The biggest problem with this film is that there is virtually no scenario, just a succession of shootouts and running. There is hardly any dialogs which would merit to be remembered, the sense of humour seems to have been completely eaten by zombies, most of decisions taken by people (both villains and good guys) doesn't make the slightest sense and let's not even talk about character development...  Milla Jovovich was asked to play here just a standard issue superhuman shooting machine and was clearly forbidden by the director to do and say anything else than shooting - and her two principal sidekicks, with whom she joins ultimately after more than 40 minutes (!) of film are even worse!  Sienna Guillory plays Jill Valentine, a police officer belonging to the Special Tactics And Rescue Squad (S.T.A.R.S.) who has the habit of coming to work dressed as a streetwalker and greatly praised may she be for that, because this firmer model is a supremely beautiful woman with such a figure, that Phidias and Praxiteles would KILL for the privilege of sculpting her (in more sense than one...). BUT, an actress she is REALLY not and even saying two lines of dialog is for her clearly an effort... And as for her character being an action hero, well, let's just say that she cannot even hold correctly the prop gun they gave her, because this thing clearly scares her...  Oded Fehr plays Carlos Oliveira, a mercenary from Umbrella Corporation private army - but being a simple soldier, he is completely unaware of all the evil plans of his bosses and in this film he actually is one of the good guys. Oded Fehr, who usually plays Bedouin holy warriors, demons from Hell or Arab terrorists, has of course all the necessary competence and physical attributes to make an awesome, legendary, bad@ss mercenary - but he is not really allowed in this film to do much. His character is just a subdued sidekick of Alice...  Another big issue with this film, that everything is centred around Alice and it really is hard to understand why is she SOOO important? Alice! Who the (----) is Alice!? But even worse, Alice enters the movie for real only after 40 minutes and in the meantime nothing really very important happens...  The second part of the film (once Alice appears) is slightly better than the completely useless first 40 minutes, but the operative word here is "slightly". There is a couple of good action scenes, but they are few and short. Of course, between those good action scenes quite a lot of munitions gets expended but mostly it is just a shooting of various fish in the barrels.  There is one sequence, involving an elementary school, which is not bad and will certainly delight all those who simply hate kids and puppies. It also makes sense that in the middle of an anthropophagic zombie infestation an elementary school is a particularly dangerous place, because playful kids need hearty balanced meals on a regular basis...))) On another hand the director couldn't follow this idea until its logical conclusion, because then this film would probably be banned in most countries...  The ending logically opens the way for the next film in the franchise and ask again the same question: Alice! Who the (----) is Alice?  Bottom line, this film is really not good and I managed to suffer through it all the way until the end only with some fast forwarding here and there (especially during all the one sided shootouts). This DVD is definitely NOT a keeper. Avoid!
0 ||| Yuck! Ordered it for my boyfriend he liked it but then only watched half the movie! Not because he didn't want to see it, or didn't like it, just to aggravate me. He woke up in the middle of the night and watched the other half! YUCK! is my opinion!
1 ||| Not quite bad enough to be funny, but close.  Pretty much nothing in the story makes sense, no-one behaves in a remotely believable way. (People line up peacefully to get let out of a city, with cannibal zombies behind them? People aren't even that polite on the subway).  Atrocious camera work just adds insult to injury. They did manage one rather nice plot surprise that I didn't see coming. About the only good point in the picture.
1 ||| I liked the game. I like watching Milla Jovovich. Did not like this movie, however. There are a few neat scenes such as the "slice and dice" lasers, but it never caught my attention and held it the whole movie, the way the original Aliens movie did. Just my opinion - take it for what it's worth.
1 ||| Unethical film producers, actors, director, Oliver Stone et al: Midnight Express "uses" (as a drugie would) a "true" situation or story to tell whatever lies they want to.  I watched this with my male friend and at the end we both turned to each other and said, "Never go to Turkey."  Others have said, "Never smuggle drugs in Turkey."  The movie failed to make a legitimate point, or explore a theme.  It exploited drugs, violence, and sex.  It simple took pleasure in machismo -- whether hetero or homo machismo.  IT FAILED TO EXPLORE THE TRULY HUMAN.  I had hope when I saw the father come to visit the son -- as in the movie "In the Name of the Father" a 5 star movie about prison, cross-cultural (Irish-English) life.  But when I saw the father shout threats at the prison warden for no other reasons than sheer anger-indulgence, I realized this movie was probably bankrupt.  The movie reflects immaturity and failure to develop a controlling vision.  There were SO many wonderful ways this material could have gone.  The creative potential was enormous.  The 70's macho culture could only see this?  Slaves to their narrow world view.  The only thing good:  the cinematography, and evocative music and some of the nonviolent prison scenarios.  I was reminded of Dante's circles of hell.  Then a little research was in order.  I was thinking of Turkey's struggles between secular democracy (Ataturk's reforms) and its Medieval past.  There were clearly two power structures and judges (the secular and the religious?) struggling for dominance.  I was thinking of the issue of individual justice and the needs of society to make an example of Billy etc etc etc...But director and producers did nothing to develop any ideas.  I have so many ideas about how this material could have been developed....  it is frustrating to see that too often this type of junk wins out.  I don't trust Oliver Stones movies about "real life."  That is a joke.  Real life is more interesting and rich and meaningful than what he "created" -- here at least.  Go to YouTube and get the backstory on this movie. That is far more interesting.  Billy is kind of despicable, but if they had honestly told his story, perhaps tweaking it here and there...the movie would have been much better.  Billy claims the experience was the best thing that happened to him!!  Why didn't they run with that?  These guys failed to go deep into the human condition, instead they got hung up on violence and sex and machismo.  Not to mention that Turkey's tourist industry has never recovered -- apparently because of this film.
0 ||| NO.
1 ||| Resident Evil is meant to be a video game series and *not* a movie series.  Simple as that.  Why?  Because the movie writers made Apocalypse nothing more than a generic run of the mill zombie flick, and a rather average one at that.  They bring in Nemesis, what I consider the ULTIMATE bad guy in the classic Resident Evil 3 game.  While extremely dangerous and intimidating in the video game, he does nothing but plod along in a slow moving way in the movie.  He's still relatively cool I suppose, with the ability to detect those who are armed and pose a threat to him which is a fascinating feature, and of course, his trusty rocket launcher is as explosive in the movie as it is in the game (of course it is- Hollywood can smell a perfect opportunity for special effects and the rocket launcher surely satisfies in that regard).  However, in the game (as Jill) you had to REALLY move your legs as quickly as possible or you'd get caught.  He's not fast enough in the movie so everyone can easily run away from him.  Cool looking, but lacking speed.  This is a vital and distinct feature that's missing.  I'm also not particularly fond of the fact that Jill Valentine takes a back seat so the always attractive Milla Jovovich can shine in the spotlight.  Throughout the film Jill basically sticks behind Milla's character so Milla can take care of all the approaching danger.  Meh, Jill deserves better in my opinion.  Also, it seems strange that Raccoon City is so enormous.  Don't get me wrong, it's a big city in the video game series so this makes total sense, it's just that it's hard to believe (without spoiling the ending in both the movie *and* video game) such a big city would be considered irrelevant when you-know-what happens at the end.  Not a good storyline direction for a movie.  There's nothing remotely scary about this movie.  Apocalypse is not going to appeal to Resident Evil 2 survival horror fans, that's for sure.  All kinds of adrenaline pumping shooting action aroung every corner with several Resident Evil 4-style athletic kicks and jumps is what you can expect instead.  I say avoid this movie and stick with the gaming series.
1 ||| Not true to actual facts
0 ||| Ugh.
1 ||| Whoa, does not hold up. It's so dated. I cannot believe the things I used to think were funny. There are some funny parts and some cute parts but it's not very good in this day and age.
0 ||| This version has been edited...I'm guessing..per Millia's request...aka shower scene is almost completely gone. Granted it is a nudity scene yes, however I don't want to pay of something that has been edited down...if I didn't want blood, sex and violence I'd watch network tv.
1 ||| The first Resident Evil surpassed my expectations and is actually an entertaining little zombie flick that I am proud to have in my zombie movie collection. Apocalypse started out awesome and then completely fell apart like 20 minutes in. This movie is just all over the place. When making a zombie movie, please stick to the zombies. We don't need to see the main character fist fight a cyborg/human/alien that carries a grenade launcher. Just shoot it in the head. The whole plot was just ridiculous. Im not even gonna try to explain it to you. This movie could have been great, they had such good material to work with. I cant believe they let it devolve into this mess.
0 ||| Extremely inaccurate representation of a country! People who have some awareness and information about the other nations will know what I mean after watching the movie!
1 ||| I liked this film when I first saw it at a movie house long long time ago and then I purchased this blu ray but the picture quality of this blu ray is quite disappointing because I can't find any better picture quality on this blu ray compared to any other DVDs.
1 ||| I can't understand how so many people think this is such a great movie. When I first saw it, having read & enjoyed the book&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Midnight-Express/dp/0445043024/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Midnight Express</a>, I waited for the incredibly exciting escape, and then went "Huh??" A really thrilling escape story was completely cheapened by the totally bogus ending of this film. Perhaps I'd have liked the film more without reading the book. Some books can be improved when turned into films, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Forest-Gump/dp/2290038164/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Forest Gump</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/For-Love-of-the-Game/dp/0345408926/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">For Love of the Game</a>, while some, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Q-A-A-Novel/dp/B003JTHSQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Q & A: A Novel</a>(upon which "Slumdog Millionaire" was very loosely based) really suffer when they reach the silver screen. This is one that really suffered. Billy Hayes has complained about both the ending, and the strong anti-Turk attitude, but when asked about a remake, he has said "It's done. Time to move on."
1 ||| Not his best work.
0 ||| I am really disappointed by the poor transfer of this BR release. There is no need to buy the BR version if you have the DVD.
0 ||| Stone won't make himself vulnerable to anyone or the facts, whether that means eliminating all JFK conspiracy theories other than his own or simplifying a story and people as he has done here in Midnight Express. Stone borrowed Billy Hayes' real story of being held in a Turkish prison for several years after being caught smuggling hashish, and hijacked it to devastating effect. [I focus on screenwriter Stone instead of director Parker because the substance of Hayes' original book was altered by Stone and Parker just created Stone's skewed vision]. Stone was successful in destroying the Turkish justice image in the minds of generations of Americans. Ask most any American [now thirty years after Stone made his movie] to picture a Turkish(or Islamic) prison or court room or justice system, and the one portrayed in Midnight Express is the one that is ingrained. Coincidence or not, it should be noted that this humiliating portrayal of Islamic justice came at a time of increased Hollywood output of negative Islamic images and favorable Israeli ones(the unprecedented and universally viewed miniseries Masada). To this day, Islam's portrayal in movies is considered horrendous by those who study it(Shaheen's 'Reel Bad Arabs').  Instead of having ANY sympathetic Muslim/Turkish characters, they ALL are beasts. It turns out the real Billy Hayes actually made friends with several Turkish inmates but accepting Stone's reality means accepting this truth as a lie. Constantly the Western inmates have more depth,..they play instruments, they sing, they constantly visibly show compassion that the Muslims lack, they even articulate in a courtroom why Western justice culture is superior to Islamic sense of justice. The Muslims in the film are stoic, opportunistic, hypocritical, and, well,..evil. They are portrayed as victims of their own culture, as the judge hangs his head down when Billy is castigating Islamic justice for its lack of mercy, and the judge seems sad when he replies that his hands are tied. There is no reaction or inquisitiveness in the faces of the Turkish prosecutor or the others - the viewer sees them as programmed by their culture. Just so the viewer isn't confused as to the root of what creates such a fiasco of justice, Stone purposefully puts Islamic prayer beads in the hands of reprehensible characters like the Turkish public defender, and makes sure that a mosque is the prominent structure occupying the frame as Billy is driven around the city by policemen. Likewise, he hangs Christian symbols on the victims in the film. The warden never attempted to rape Hayes, as the film depicts, nor did Hayes murder anyone. The raping warden, with his piggish obese kids, is a metaphor for the appetite and stern lack of fidelity/tolerance that Stone seems to want to broadcast about Islam to the viewer. Stone's manufactured murder of the raping warden may have been an effort to implant the idea that the resolution the [mostly Christian] viewers should expect between their culture and the grotesque monster of Islam will take the form of a violent showdown.  The viewer can't help but feel relief at the death of the warden, and then carries away from the movie farmer Stone's seed of predjudice against Islam.  The differences between the book and the film is evidence that Stone possibly used the powerful vehicle of a "true story" to instigate prejudice against Turks/Muslims. Billy Hayes, now 56 years old and living in LA, recently tried[in the Seattle Post] to correct Stone's portrayal of his book: "The message of 'Midnight Express' isn't 'Don't go to Turkey', it's 'Don't be an idiot like I was, and try to smuggle drugs." and, "I loved the movie, but I wish they'd shown some good Turks. You don't see a single one in the movie, and there were a lot of them, even in the prison. It created this impression that all Turks are like the people in 'Midnight Express.'"
0 ||| The movie "Resident Evil" was very good and I had very high hopes for this sequel. What a disappointment. I do not even want to waste much time on a review because I wasted far to much time watching the movie. There is not one good thing that I can recommend about this one. It is poor in every aspect.
0 ||| Don't you love that studio deceit where they say something is "based on" a true story -- which they then think means they can distort and falsify virtually every single detail?  But after they've already changed and twisted every significant event in it anyway, why didn't they just say it took place in the mythical country of Xenophobia, instead of going ahead and viciously maligning an entire nation of the kindest, friendliest, most hospitable people on Earth?  The one TRUE fact is that Billy Hayes was a convicted drug smuggler who got caught red-handed. (Apparently the film-makers think that Hayes being a well-heeled American should entitle him to special exemptions from the law.)  Everything else is a lie.  The girlfriend?  Didn't exist!  The climactic (and inexcusable) "nation of pigs" speech?  Never happened!  Our macho "hero" firmly rejecting the advances of the blond guy?  Read the book -- Billy Hayes himself says that sometimes they made love.  Even the biting off tongue and escaping scene at the end is nothing like what really happened.  Virtually every detail of it was false, even the location.  Billy Hayes was never raped in the Turkish prison -- but if the real Billy took those blond curls of his into an AMERICAN prison, I'll bet he sure would have been.  He'd never be able to walk again.  I find it utterly contemptible that the film-makers rounded up a cast of ARMENIANS and GREEKS to play Turks as being a bunch of hideously sadistic goons.  Were they really that ignorant of history?  Not to mention that the worst and most brutal one was played by the very American Paul Smith.  There wasn't a real Turk in the pack.  Oliver Stone apologized to the Turkish people when he finally visited Turkey, and he was kindly forgiven -- but I sure wouldn't have let him off so easily.  His self-serving "apology" was far too little, and far too late.
0 ||| I failed to try and watch it within my 30 days and am now stuck with a useless DVD. The back has too many scratches for my DVD player to even be able to read it. Right now I wonder who should replace it since it was never viewed. Even the special features DVD looks pretty cruddy on the back. The other DVDs from the same shipment all arrived fine. This was obviously bad before it shipped to me.  So I purchased a second one and darn if there isn't something screwy going on with some DVDs. The second one looks fine, but like my THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH dvd, it will not play in my regular DVD player. Somewhat of a fortunate bit of luck, I have a mobile player this second one will work in.  Do I now return the second one by shipping the first one back? I am still stuck with one that was damaged when it was created and one that won't play in a normal DVD player.
1 ||| Alice wakes up to a plague in Raccoon City. Trapped with a small group of survivors, she is forced into finding the daughter of one of the scientists on the t-virus project, in exchange for passage out of the cordoned-off city. But now there's a new threat--along with the zombies and killer hounds, there is Nemesis, a post-human armored mutant. Lucky for Alice she's been given new abilities while she was sleeping. A great excuse for a lot of violence, with very little plot. The makers of Apocalypse don't really understand horror, believing, apparently that special effects and graphic destruction create terror. They don't.
1 ||| I hate all the reviewers and critics who say that "fans of the video game are going to love this movie." These critics normally aren't gamers or fans of the source material, so how can they be an adequate judge of the tastes of gamers? I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil game franchise, the very person these critics believe that will enjoy the Resident Evil films. But I DESPISE these movies. And why, do you ask? Because they really aren't much like the games at all. Oh sure, there's a mansion, zombies, zombie dogs, a "Licker" creature, and the malignant Umbrella corporation. But aside from those aesthetical similarities, the film bears little resemblance to the games.  When preproduction of the first Resident Evil film began, the legendary George Romero, whose Dead franchise was a major inspiration for the Resident Evil games, was commissioned to write a script. His script shared many similarities to the game, such as the inclusion of characters like Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, and Albert Wesker. However, it also made changes to the story that game developers Capcom didn't like, and Romero was ultimately turned down. Instead, they hired Paul WS Anderson, director of Event Horizon and another video game movie, Mortal Kombat. His treatment was more like a prequel to the games, and this approach was more acceptable to Capcom's head honchos. Anderson's treatment was greenlit, and "Resident Evil: Ground Zero" went into production (the "Ground Zero" subtitle was abandoned after the events of September 11th).  The film begins in The Hive, a massive laboratory facility beneath Raccoon City. The mutagenic T-Virus is being tested in the labs, but someone releases the virus, infecting the hundreds of scientists within the facility. Sensing the outbreak, The Hive's security system, the artifically-intelligent Red Queen, locks down the facility and douses everyone in halon to further prevent their escape.  We switch to Alice (Milla Jovovich), who awakens in an empty mansion after passing out in the shower. Her collapse has has given her amnesia, a condition that becomes ever more frightening when a team of nameless Special Ops soldiers (see: fodder) employed by Umbrella storms the mansion. Turns out that the mansion serves as a secret entrance to The Hive, and the team has been sent to infiltrate The Hive and investigate its lockdown. The team directs Alice down into the bowels of the facility to assist with the task. Why they can't determine the nature of the lockdown from the outside is beyond me, since that would be a much more logical thing to do. And why can't they just trust the security system they created and leave The Hive locked down, rather than endangering the lives of an entire Special Ops team and potentially the lives of everyone on the outside by reopening the Hive? But as you're going to find out while watching the Resident Evil films, logic does not exist in this dojo.  Anyway, Alice and the team discover that the T-Virus has turned everyone in The Hive into flesh-eating zombies, and they must get out of the facility before it is sealed up  permanently. But seeing the risk of letting them leave, the Red Queen isn't going to make it easy for them.  The Resident Evil games excel at creating a dark, suspenseful atmosphere, where you don't know what horrors are literally waiting around the corner. The main characters are given little ammunition to fend off the hordes of zombies and creatures salivating for their flesh, perpetuating a sense of doom and dread since the player must be methodical and conservative with their weapons. Writer/director Anderson attempts to establish a suspenseful mood by not even introducing the zombies until about halfway through the film. But sadly, all attepted suspense is lost once the flesheaters appear and the Covert Ops team whip out their big machine guns and blast away at them. The film becomes less about mood and scares and more about action and gunfire.  The emphasis on action increases once Alice begins regaining her memory, suddenly remembering that she is a martial arts expert who can run along walls, do flying kicks, and break necks with her thighs. It feels like her sparring partner was Trinity in The Matrix.  In fact, the film cribs a lot of elements from The Matrix Bargain Bin, such as references to Alice in Wonderland (Alice, the Red Queen, the entrance to The Hive is a mirror), wire-fu, slow-motion bullets, and a lead character who suddenly discovers that they have incredible abilities. The film also seems to "borrow" elements from other genre films like Cube and Day of the Dead, though it's hard to criticize the game for using elements of Romero's zombie films since the games themselves are inspired by them.  The film also possess a chugging, screeching metal/electronica score composed by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson. No, I'm not kidding. Shock rocker Marilyn Manson assisted in the creation of the film's score. It's actually quite good, even if the combination of the crunching electronic guitars, pounding drum machines, and heavy gunfire could give you a headache by the end of the film.  This film is "meh". It isn't great, it isn't good, it isn't god-awful. It's quite derivative of other films it shouldn't be, and it lacks the elements that make the game so great. The acting is...well...there. It's also hard to care about characters who don't even have names. The only reason we know that Milla Jovovich's character is named Alice is because it's in the end credits. Characters are almost never addressed by their names during the film. So you feel almost completely indifferent when half the cast is killed off fairly early in the film. They all feel like nameless, faceless fodder, as bad as any cast of horny teens in any random 80's slasher film.  The highlights? The score and the rather humorous audio commentary of Anderson, Jovovich, producer Jeremy Bolt, and castmate Michelle Rodriguez. Jovovich sounds like she's in full "valley girl" mode here, and they joke about everything from Milla's gas (a little T.M.I. if you ask me), their time spent in a German nightclub (the film was shot mostly in Berlin), and cast member Eric Mabius' affinity for yogurt. But it says a lot about a film when one of the major highlights of the film is its audio commentary. After all, you don't watch Mystery Science Theater 3000 because the movies they're riffing on are great.
1 ||| As far as action flicks go, this one is decent.  It isn't anything spectacular, but it has ample amounts of blood and guts (the cube scene alone is a highlight) and some adrenaline pumping music to make the `zombie killing' entertaining.  In the end the film comes off feeling rather cheap, but it isn't a complete disaster.  Still, having been a fan of the videogames, I must say that this film went a direction I was not expecting and thus proved itself far less than I could have hoped for.  If you are a fan of the videogames, or have at least played them once or twice, you'd know that the whole idea behind this game (and the endless copycats) is to scare you.  You play it locked up in your room in the dead of night and find yourself transported to a place that shocks you.  Every noise makes your heart jump.  That is the exact feeling I wanted from this movie.  `Resident Evil' is not an action/adventure type game.  It is a dark and slowly paced horror game.  That is what this movie needed to be.  It needed to layer on the fear and tension, not the action.  Sure, it's cool to see Milla Jovovich kick some serious zombie butt, but I'd rather have seen her hyperventilate in a dark room while she listened to the corpses dragging their broken limbs across the hall on the other side of the door.  It's my opinion, but I think it is what the videogame warranted.  Taking my personal preference aside, this movie does deliver to a certain extent.  The story it develops is engaging (and the back story does have a certain amount of depth) and they tried hard to layer it with elements from the film, but overall it feels a tad hollow or unimportant.  When it's all over you don't feel like you need to watch it again.  There are far better zombie films out there (Danny Boyle's masterpiece '28 Days Later' is everything this film SHOULD have been).  Jovovich is a stunning piece of eye candy, and I really enjoy watching her breathe, so I was game for this film and its ridiculous sequels.  Still, I wish she were a better actress and I wish she were in better films.
1 ||| This used to be one of my favorite movies but it no longer is. When I was younger I did not bother trying to comprehend the underlying message of this movie, nor any other movie for that matter. The message of this movie is now perfectly clear to me: convicts in Turkish prisons are frequently maltreated and tortured. Turkish prisons are inhumane and the entire justice system is flawed, corrupt and unjust. Moreover, the director of this movie implicitly implies that all Turks are barbarous, intransigent and uncivilized. This is corroborated by the fact that all Turkish characters in this movie are evil and their intentions are always malicious. Also an attempt is made to defame Islam and to show it as a religion which is inhumane, barbaric and merciless. On the other hand, Christians are depicted as humane and infallible. The principal point of this movie is that the Turkish society is flawed and atavistic as its justice system shows no mercy towards drug smugglers, rapists and murderers. Many of these assertions may be true but it would be a gross overgeneralization and oversimplification to claim that all of this is true and that these injustices are unique for Turkey. The director of this movie should have done some research at home before he set out to criticize an entire nation. Consider some of these facts: U.S.A. still has capital punishment; it has been demonstrated in many cases that the application of the death penalty is racially discriminatory (much more blacks are sentenced to death than whites); in many states, minors and mentally retarded are sentenced to death even though this violates the U.S. constitution; the U.S. government incarcarates people without letting them know what they have been charged with and denies them adequate legal representation etc. (Guantanamo Bay in Cuba). If these facts are not indicative of a flawed and unjust justice system, then what is? In my view, it is extremely hypocritical and cynical not to judge our own actions and transgressions by the same standards we apply to others. This is a good movie but it would have been much better had it not been so severely biased and prejudiced.
0 ||| I loved this movie, but the only version is full screen, not widescreen. Worthless now that almost everyone has a widescreen TV.
0 ||| This is one of the worst movies I've seen ever. This is a story about a man, nammed Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) who tries to smuggle hessise(turkish drug) across the boader to America. But there is one small problem he gets caught. He is sentecenced to serve four years in a turkish prison. Billy leaves a worried girlfriend, father, mother, brother, and sister behind. In the prison he meets durgies and a whole new kind of people he never thought would exsist. The guards beat and tourcher not only him but everybody in that prison and other prisons in that part of the world were just the same. In Turkey who don't have the right to free speech like in America so when he went to court he had a hard time trying to defend himself. Billy is then sentenced to 30 years in the prison which I might add does not really qualify as a prison at all in my opinon. Billy and Rand quaid and one other person try to escape for every day for a whole week but then they are caught by a inmatte who gives randy qaid away. Randy is beaten so bad that he is in a hospital for months with a hernia. Billy gets so mad he kills ruski the immate who gives them away and basically goes insane witth rage and then immeditly after he is sent to a turkish mental institution with pyscos. His girlfriend talks to him and he has a new light os getting out. He bribes then kills a guard puts on his uniform and leaves. Three months later he crosses the boarder into Greece and gets on a plane and goes back to America to reunite with his family. This is emmotional true story. I don't like this movie for many reasons one is almost have the movie is spoken in the turkish natoinal language. This has too many graphic seens that I don't care for and many people won't like. I was frequntly looking at how much time was left in the movie and you should never be doing that when your wacthing a movie. I don't like this for another reason becausethe story is horribal even though it is true. I just don't like to see Americans being beaten in a turkish prison. Maybe you would like to rent this movie and see what I'm talking about but this is definitly not a movie to buy.
1 ||| My review is for the SUPERBIT release of this movie. SUPERBIT is supposed to represent the top of the line and best image quality a DVD can achieve and many times those DVDs are actually reference DVDs. Well, the quality in this SUPERBIT edition of RESIDENT EVIL is so so, not bad not good, just like any other DVD. It certainly does not do justice to the SUPERBIT term. Other DVDs that honor the SUPERBIT name are the FIFTH ELEMENT and THE BIG HIT version but this version is nothing to talk about. It is not as terrible as the other SUPERBIT DVD or Charlie's Angels but if you are buying this DVD for reference or video quality purposes look elsewhere.
1 ||| OK, if you can sympathize with an idiot who would strap several kilos of hash to his body to smuggle them from a country where penalties for such crimes are often met with DEATH, then you can go with this slick,  atmospheric and incredibly violent movie.  Admittedly, it gets under your  skin, and Brad Davis was mightily effective in the role of Billy Hayes, and  John Hurt embodies creepily the stoned out prison mate Billy befriends  during his harrowing odyssey.  But this movie, directed with typical  stylish flair by visual master Alan Parker, never places the blame squarely  on Billy's shoulders, poor dumb guy.  And while his torturous stay in the  Turkish prisons practically smells, it is so dense and well-captured, it  did nothing for the image of Turkey, the country -- it is uncompromising  and brutally vicious in its depiction of virtually every Turkish location,  character and idea, for that matter.  If Turkey was such a pit of despair,  why did Billy decide to buy his hash there?  This movie revolves around a  character who is unrepentant and foolish, and while no one should have to  endure such human indignation, it is hard to escape that simple fact.  Parker's movie, taken on its own terms, has an almost poetic quality at  times, though Billy's dismissal of the Swede's advances actually made me  laugh out loud, and, by the way, was consummated in the book.  With so much  depravity at every turn, and hellish imprisonment your destiny, why  wouldn't Billy seek another human, even if he happens to be a man?
0 ||| I think we all agree that this 1987 classic romantic comedy is absolutely wonderful, entertaining, magic, funny and hylarious. The best romantic comedy for some, one of the best comedies of the 80's for others. Great story, incredible performance of steve martin , great production and artistic direction by Fred Schepisi. We can argue with that of course, but one thing beyond discussion, is that this Sony Pictures 2002 DVD edition for this masterpiece is so awful, that it manages to destroy the experience.  I had to put up with a VHS edition for 15 years, for what! This? I can say without any doubt, that this is one of the worst DVD editions i own, behind my Asian bootleg martial arts copies. Absolutely awful, this edition manages to restrain the impact of the movie with all the worst features of the fullscreen edition: Extreme close-ups, alternate or moving angles from the same take, chopped off characters from the scenes, people talking to shoulders and corners, people talking from outside the picture, missing scenarios and landscapes, blurry video quality... my god! Not even the 5.1 english soundtrack could emerge, not even the movie could! Extras? The movie trailer...In widescreen! It was torture.  By far, the worst 7 dollars i have ever spent, and a disapointment i'm never gonna forget.  My recomendation for fans looking for this wonderful movie in DVD: Go outside the store and get the widescreen edition, online or on local stores. I'm desperatly seeking for other better editions, i'm even willing to download it, or even buy a bootleg.  Whatever you do: Please, please, don't buy this awful Sony 2002 fullscreen edition.  And Sony pictures: Widescreen versions fit the screen too!
1 ||| This review has nothing to do with the movie, i love Resident Evil. But the Blu Ray transfer is bad,bad,bad......!!!!!!!  After watching Dark Knight, i watched Resident Evil... Lo and behold the vast difference of the two. Dark Knight has superb picture quality but Resident Evil is Grainy.. Stick to the DVD is my recomendation...
0 ||| I really don't care what anyone says.  I could not finish this movie.  It was horrible.  I was forced into renting it because we had to do this Cyrano de Bergerac/Roxanne compare/contrast sheet for French.  I am unhappy that I had to shell out three bucks to rent a movie I never even really wanted to see.  The fact that it was a bad movie didn't help the situation. Steve Martin may think he's being clever, but really he isn't.  I absolutely hated his charcter, who, despite his big nose, was awfully cocky.  Now, I wasn't a huge fan of the real Cyrano de Bergerac, so that MAY be part of the problem.  Nevertheless, the plot made me roll my eyes and every bit of the movie bored me to tears.  Please try to find something that is actually witty and funny, like The Simpsons.  The Simpsons knows how to paraody literature.
0 ||| It's another bad zombie movie. Compared to the majority of thhe others, the only difference here is the main character is a female. The plot is the same. The action scenes are not engaging. Special effects  are so so.
0 ||| The pecial effects look exactly like that of a computer game, not real. The action is the top. There's no plot. It's not woth watching.
0 ||| You watch an Ed Wood film, it's bad, but it's fun. It's fun because the director cared, and despite the fact that Ed Wood wasn't a good director, his personality and care is evident in his films.  Resident Evil is made by Paul Anderson, and he quite obviously doesn't care.  Forget what all of you are saying about 'It's another silly zombie movie' or 'It's from a game so I suppose it was always going to be bad'.  The reality is, the games are extremely well executed, as are George A Romero films (G.A.R being the original guy who was to direct this.)  A great story is in the telling, this story was not told well. It could not have been told worse. This guy, quite obviously, has no idea of how to tell a story or direct a film. I trusted him due to Mortal Kombat and Event Horizon, but after Resident Evil and the appauling AVP, it would appear that those first two films are only as good as they are due to good producers and scripts.  Stay away, stay well away.  An absolute travesty in every sense. To think of the millions of lives you could save with the money that was wasted on this garbage.
1 ||| The first film was much better than R.E. Apocalypse; more gore, better acting, better presentation overall, and it was done with a lot less money!
1 ||| I did watch Resident Evil: Apocalypse back when it was in theaters & I rather enjoyed it! this movie, I just got to today & found myself wondering what the hell happened. the movie is just so much stupider then the second one. I found myself laughing at parts where we're "supposed to be scared". the acting is just not that good, it's corny as hell. hasn't anyone in this film ever heard of a zombie before? if a zombie was coming at you, would you lower your weapon or blast it apart? like, what are they doing? I got so mad at this film cause it's so stupid. why do the characters have to be so dumb? I'll blame the writers, the director's for this. Resident Evil is not worth your time or money. I found the second one more enjoyable for some reason. so please, look elsewhere. I'd be more entertained by a fish swimming in circles.
0 ||| After seeing the first Resident Evil movie and liking it, I was expecting a whole lot more from this film, which I had been anticipating as soon as I found out they were going to make a sequel. Unfortunately, RE Apocalypse doesn't have any of the things that made the first one good! Resident Evil was first and foremost a horror movie, with zombies and other creatures and a bit of a sci-fi touch, a lot of story going on and a great addition to the mythos of the game, with a plot that tied in neatly and nicely provided more fictional background for the RE world. The make-up and special effects were top-notch, and all of the actors, including the ones with minor roles, did a fantastic job.  RE Apocalypse accomplishes none of these things. If you're expecting a horror movie, what you get is a weird combination of the Kung-Fu and action genres. There's no character development, the plot is shallow and even Mila dropped the ball with her acting in this one.  I found the movie to be extremely boring and run-of-the-mill, and was also sad to see what they did to a franchise that could have been great if they'd improved upon the first movie's many strengths and taken out just some of its weaknesses.  In short, this movie was a complete waste of time and has thoroughly discouraged me from seeing the third one, which is set to be released next year. Somebody would literally have to pay me to see it!
0 ||| To be honest, I never really had much fate in Video game adaptations. Most of them in the past have failed miserably. Here, Resident Evil Apocalyse has made it even worse. A continuation from the first so-so Resident evil film. Umberella have decided to re-open the Hive, unknowingly letting the T-Virus out throughout the city, turning the people of Racoon city into zombies. Firsts of all, I love the Resident Evil video games( especially Resident Evil 4 ). Its what gave me encouragment to see this film. Before I actually saw this film I was thinking that this might be in some way decent. To be honest, it didn't even seem in anyway related to the Resident Evil series.  When it comes to bringing these video games to the big screen you need to ask yourself, What makes the actuall game itself such a success? If you take Silent Hill for instance. Probably one of the few video game adaptations that was an actuall success. They have really taken the Silent Hill video game features into perspective and shown us how this is actually done. It actually felt like Silent Hill. But in this case, it looks like the Resident Evil video games where just thrown aside. There is absolutely nothing meaningful from the video games that was put into this film and absolutely nothing atmospheric about it that even makes it feel like Resident Evil environment. And the atmospheric soundtrack from the video games have been replaced by Heavy Metal music. It felt like an absolute joke. It seems that they didn't even take the Resident Evil video games into consideration and without it, this film lost all its perspectives and has no meaning for the Resident Evil title. This is just a pointless action sci-fi. Film makers really need to take these video game adaptions more seriously. This is an insult to the Resident Evil video game series.
1 ||| Please read this review before you decide if it's helpful or not. Seriously, I played the games they are fun, I saw the first film, it was pretty good, this one does not have much going for it. If you want a good shoot-em-up Zombie film see the remake of "Dawn of the Dead" or even the great comedy "Shaun of the Dead". Both of those movies will give you so much more than this one. The "Lickers" in the Church is a good scene, and a brief scene with Zombie Hookers is cool, and that is the two stars I give it. Nemesis (The huge monster villian in this movie) looks no better than a Power Rangers creature I kid you not, and the acting is non-existent. If you are the kind of person that will enjoy anything with the "Resident Evil" tag you may like it just fine, but people with a higher-standard on their action/horror films REALLY should look elsewhere..........the Zombie Hookers are cool though.
1 ||| After just reading the book the movie was quite a disappointment.  Of course a movie cannot have the detail of the book, but a lot of the highlights I thought were overlooked.  It lacked telling the love the people had for their land and the sacrifice for it.  The movie was mostly just a love story, and there are so many of those that are just monotony rehashed.
1 ||| Story about adultery with lots of violence as well as sex.
1 ||| Resident Evil 2 has much of the same qualities as the first film did.  For instance, both films cut right into the story with little background, and the two films end just as precipitously.  However, there are some differences to be sure.  For instance, while in the first film the zombies are restricted to Umbrella Corp.'s compound, in the second these mutants overwhelm all of Raccoon City.  In addition, while the first focused on twisting plot development, with little truly exciting action, the second tries to, somewhat successfully, turn this around with the main characters fighting the mutants from the start.  Oh yeah, also while at the end of the first film, we see a guy ripped away to be used for some experiment and we the audience actually are upset; but, in the second film the tenderness for this man-turned-mutant is never developed enough for us to care, and I mean at all.  Other then that, the two really are just the same poor fare.  Both of which clearly made for, or from, the video game realm, because the story translates poorly to film form.  Why?  Basic action, basic characters, and a complex plot that's going to be dragged out for not one, not two, not three, but four films!!!  You could make one film, or just read some short story, that gives the same entertainment that these films do.  Oh well though, I am only a reviewer and regrettably cannot actually tell directors what to make and what not to make.  (It's probably better this way)
0 ||| Following the moderate success of the first "eh, good enough" film, Resident Evil: Apocalypse continues the story of Alice, one of the few survivors of the T-Virus outbreak that turned the Hive facility's employees into flesh-eating zombies. The Umbrella Corporation has reopened the Hive and the T-Virus has escaped into the Raccoon City above it. Now, Alice - who is now superpowered thanks to Umbrella tinkering with her DNA - must once again escape hordes of zombies, hellhounds, and Umbrella-created mutations before the whole city is nuked off the map.  With her this time are characters that are actually from the games the movie is based on - sexy cop Jill Valentine (played by Sienna Guillory) and Carlos Oliveira (Oded Fehr). Since the Alice character was inspired by the Jill character, they are almost exactly the same atttude-wise, and do we really need two of the same character in the same movie? Sorry, we don't. The movie is supposed to take place during the Resident Evil 3 game which Jill is the star of, but whenever Jill gets in trouble in this film, Alice swoops in like Supergirl and saves her ass. They totally waste the Jill character just to keep the awful Alice story going, and it's sad to see the character that stars in the game get upstaged left and right by a character that was never in the games. Booooo! Maybe they should have just left the game's characters out of this film so they could keep the film and game separate.  This brings up the problems with the story. Since Alice wasn't in any of the games and this film is supposed to be about the third Resident Evil game, this puts the film in the "it's kind like but kinda not like the game" category, so you don't even know where it exists in the canon of the games' storyline. Second, some of the plot points are incredibly stupid from the start. After all, why would a corporation design a research facility with a special security system designed to seal the place off should something disasterous happen and then try to reopen the facility not once but TWICE once something so bad happens that the place needs to be sealed off? Couldn't they take the hint the first time they reopened the place and lost an entire Special Ops team inside? And wasn't the guy that escaped that was infected with their T-Virus enough of a hint that there had been a T-Virus outbreak? The logic that sets this film in motion is so annoyingly flawed. You'd think a major coporation like Umbrella was smarter than this. They could have at least tried to explain it off that the Hive was reopened with the purpose of letting the T-Virus escape to see how effective their bio-weapon was in a major city? That's one of the explanations they give in the game, but they don't even do that in the film.  Second, why are they giving Alice more and more powers? How are we supposed to relate to her? Part of the appeal of zombie films - or most films in general - is that you can relate to the characters. You can mentally put yourself in their position, and you worry about their well-being. But what happens when the character you're supposed to relate to becomes so powerful they can do somersaults, know tons of martial arts out of the blue, and can kill people with telepathy? Alice becomes so powerful and superhuman, you never fear she won't survive. It's called the Superman Syndrome - a character becomes so powerful, that you don't care what happens to them because you already know.  Now there's the Nemesis. They turn a badass killing machine into a good guy in the end! Part of what makes some villains so fun is that they're so bad - they're so bad, they're good. That was part of the appeal of Nemesis. But instead, they turn him into a kinder, gentler Nemesis who saves the day in the end.  The Resident Evil movies are supposed to be zombie movies, but they're made into action/sci-fi bullcrap. Sure, zombie films have some action in them, but it's more realistic action. Sadly, these films use stylized action that look like they were taken from the Matrix Bargain Bin with its slow motion bullets, wire-fu, and choppy editing to try making the film look "cool". And they fail miserably. Zombie films make the action secondary, but this is an action film and the zombies are secondary.  The first film spent half its running time zombie-free, as they tried to set up suspense and that's pretty understandable. This time around, there should be zombies galore, right? But the plotting is so damn slow, you almost forget there are zombies in the film! And even when the zombies are on-screen, they use this filming style that looks like choppy stop-motion animation! Who thought this was a good idea in post-production? Whoever has this film editor hired now on ANY film, fire them immediately.  UPDATE - This visual characteristic is called "dropping frames," and it usually occurs accicentally during editing when transferring footage from film to digital editing software. When the software is having trouble converting one of the frames the footage for whatever reason, that frame is "dropped". The blur yousee is the footage skipping over the missing frame. It happens rarely, and when it does happen, it's either barely noticeable to the audience , or it requires the editor to make adjustments or find a different method to convert the footage. But in Resident Evil: Apocalypse, it appears that the editor is intentionally dropping frames to create this visual effect. Why? Is there something wrong with the zombies that they have to obscure the audience's view of them? Do they think (erroneously) that it makes the zombies scarier? Or are the zombies too visually disturbing that they have to be blurred in order to make an R rating?  Whatever the reason, this is a TERRIBLE visual characteristic, and whoever masterminded this decision needs to go back to college and take a few film classes.  I'm sorry, the LJ character is so blatantly offensive. Do we really need the loud-mouthed black comic relief these days? The only way this would have been more offensive and cliched is if they had some Vaudeville-esque performer in blackface tap-dancing and eating watermelon throughout the film.  And I'm certain that the only reason they made it possible to kill the zombies by snapping their necks was to tone down the gore and get it past the MPAA with an R rating, not to mention that video games still have the "just kid's stuff" reputation, and thus movies based on video games suffer a similar stigma so they have to be toned down for "the kids." But this is supposed to be a ZOMBIE FILM, it's supposed to be gory! The games, which are supposedly "just kid's stuff," actually have MORE gore than the movies made about them. So as far as zombie films go, the Resident Evil films are pretty tame. Hell, they could have gone with more gore, taken it out so the film could get an R, then put it back in for an Unrated Version on DVD. That would have been more acceptable than these zombie film abominations.  And am I the only one who is so tired of the blue tint they see in every action/sci-fi film since The Matrix? I haven't been to a single city where the lighting is blue EVERYWHERE at night. Enough with the blue lighting, damn it.  Believe me, if I could have given this film 0 Stars, I would have. This is truly a horrible film. Horrible-looking, horribly-written, horribly-directed, and so on. It's such a shame that video games are being so poorly represented on film this way.
0 ||| I got suckered in, I'll admit it. I kept telling myself that the sequel will be better than the original. But it wasn't. The plot was all over the place and there were just too many predictable moments followed by a useless need to just deliver action without a comprehendable story. It's almost like the filmakers were constantly trying to outdo themselves. Granted, the costumes are very well done, the characters look like the characters, but there are just too many ridiculous searching scenes and dull lines like ' try to shoot em in the head' and the classic ' who the f are you?' It just gets repeatative. What results is a movie that could have been better but failed to even make par. Better luck next time, guys. And if that isn't enough, there's a hint that there might be another sequel. Oh brother is all I have to say. The only thing that saved this movie was the fact that it had a lot of good cinematograpghy and style. Also, the token black guy was hilarious throughout the whole movie. But, trust me on this folks, rent it. Don't buy it.
0 ||| When I saw "Resident Evil" I like it, although it was a free version of the game, of the story. But "Resident Evil - Apocalypse", it's disastrous. With a useless explanation by Alice of what happened in the first film and flashbacks. I think they made some kind of mistake when editing the film because the story can be confusing. The dialogues are bad and the performance terrible; why make Alice look tough in the film? And the zombies almost doesn't appear. The special effects are bad and Nemesis is just a mass of makeup, not to mention the music. The only good thing in the movie is Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory, which perfomance as a sexy policewoman reults unbelieveable.
1 ||| I watched this almost immediately after finishing the book.  Even in this age of epic cable adaptation like Game of Thrones, I understand some plot pieces must be sacrificed for film.  However, in this case it was the equivalent of taking "The Lord of the Rings" and turning it into a romance between Aragorn and Arwen with the rest of the novel just being occasionally referred to.  They even change who the Prince of Tides is in the movie!!  This movie may satisfy Streisand fans who have not read the book, or perhaps other people who haven't read the book.  If you read and remember the novel fondly, you will find this movie wanting.
0 ||| A chic flick which does not pretend to be anything else. But, despite the presence of Streisand it is Ok for what it tries to do with the Conroy story.
1 ||| Is it even possible to make a decent movie out of a video game? As we continue our tour of movies pre-made from video games, we're starting to doubt that. Video games have already revealed everything. Where can the movie go and stay true to the video game (assuming "staying true" has any meaning in such circumstances). In RS2 we're given every genre gimmick and stereo-type in the book trying to flesh out a story that is already very well-known. Nothing can ever succeed on that basis. Good movies--great movies--are new, strange, and exciting. The writing needs to go in utterly new directions to be meaningful. It's a tremendous risk... and probably one the studios are unwilling to take. But there is a precedent. Shakespeare himself took stories--well-known stories--and wove them in new ways to create the greatest stage-plays ever written. Is this so entirely different from taking concepts from video games and putting them on the screen? Video games provide a shorthand and background that screenwriters could exploit if they chose. Instead, the choose to exploit a too-willing audience.  WHO SHOULD SEE THIS  As we've often stated here at Inchoatus, there is a certain charm in going to see some kind of mindless film. Well, this film is utterly mindless. And it has swearing, nudity, blood, and fighting to go with it. If you want to get seriously drunk and go see some women kick ass, then you've probably found a movie. Go rent it and just make sure you're pretty damned drunk when you go see it. There is no reason--none at all--to see it sober. The film is void of any artistic merit whatsoever.  WHO SHOULD AVOID  The goal of Inchoatus is to elevate the genre. We're founded precisely to encourage people to avoid films precisely like this. There are actually some decent films out there that feature blood, nudity, and fighting. Conan the Barbarian is an excellent example. The Event Horizon is another. Even Underworld had some merit to it. The anim film Ghost in a Shell is a tremendous film. As the core audience for all things speculative fiction, we don't have to automatically succumb to this kind of stuff just because they market it. If we can just muster the strength to show a little resistance to this kind of schlock, producers will be forced to provide something better. Is there a better reason to avoid seeing this film? We think not.  Obviously, anyone who isn't well and truly immersed in zombie movies or horror flicks--or has a very serious thing for Milla Jovavich--should avoid this film.  READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM
1 ||| This isn't a bad zombie movie, but then again it isn't a good one either. Although one knows what to expect in such a movie,  any kind of plot usually keeps things exciting. In this case  however the plot is not particularly interesting. As so many people get slaughtered during the first 20 minutes, we the  viewers do not really care anymore about a little girl getting saved or not. Milla Jovovitch's stunt fights are surreal and her battle with Nemesis, clearly a distant relative of an Uruk-Hai from Lord of the rings, looks silly. I think this movie is unlucky that the crowd's appetite for zombie movies is starting to temper a little. We now want a reasonable story as well.  Just shooting zombies isn't enough anymore. Shame about this movie though, as it obviously is a lot better than the previous part. This just looks like a wasted opportunity.(SARR)
1 ||| Paul Anderson shouldn't be allowed in hollywood period. The guy can't direct, and he can't write a good movie.  His second try at the Resident Evil series, while better then the first, is still crap compared to REAL horror movies. It's kinda like asking to be kicked in the nuts once instead of twice...ones better but who really wants either option?  I guess this is fine though for people who can't handle the real horror movies, like 15 year old girls and horny guys who only want to stare at the hot main star. It's generic and cheap looking at times, much more so then the budget would suggest.  I would only recommend this if you can't handle real horror, or if you've already seen all there is to see in the form of horror movies.
1 ||| Let me start off by saying if you like true horror/zombie movies, then don't even bother watching this movie, it's a horror movie made for the mainstream, meaning it sucks.  Sure the lead character is hot, sure there are some nice looking zombies in the movie...but thats where all the good stuff ends.  The video game for the PS1 (and it's gamecube remake) are amazing, both in atmosphere and story telling, why the movie didn't follow them more closely is beyond me. Instead you get some horrible story about a computer and the t-virus (which is the only thing in the entire movie from the games, that and the spider-man creature).  Paul W.S. Anderson should not be allowed to make movies ever again, he is a stain on hollywood that needs to be cleaned away.
0 ||| This Paul Anderson is a really funny guy. Every script he puts his hands on turns to crap. OMG this movie was just horrible. Come on people why are yall even giving this guy your money. Movies are not supposed to suck. The more money yall give to this guy the more movies hes going to make. And this it a bad thing BTW.  Don't buy this DVD or rent it. The first R.E. was good but could of been better. But this one is OMG just horrible. Lets just hope that the next R.E. movie going to have a diffrent movie director.  Just pass on this one, OK!!!
1 ||| To say this movie was a good, successful one would in fact be a lie. In my opinion this was a terrible sequel to a movie that I adore. For starters, it is unrealistic in its approach to situations presented in the Resident Evil world, and by taking away Alice's feminine vulnerability it detracts from her character a heck of a lot.  The staged characters that are in the games are nothing like their counterparts. Jill, for one, does not do the character justice at all, nor does Carlos. And can I say that the other characters while at first seemed interesting, were killed off far too quickly to develop any emotional attachment to them.  The pace of the movie was too fast and it was not easy to catch on to what we are supposed to be seeing. Not only that, but every five seconds it seemd like there is a fight scene that has no purpose what-so-ever as opposed to the balanced feel of it's predecessor.  Overall I am very dissapointed with this title, and I would not recommend it at all!
1 ||| Beautifully filmed but otherwise, a vanity piece for producer Streisand who loves the camera to love her and blonde love interests--Nolte, Redford, Bridges.  Best Nolte ever looked and good performances from Kate Nelligan and Blythe Daner but otherwise, offputting by profanity and focus on Streisand.
0 ||| Disgusting because of a scene where the mom, a little girl and boy get raped. It is very graphic. Burn this movie.
0 ||| Resident Evil is an onion of stupidity. It's just layer after layer after layer of the most retarded plot points, character dialogue and CG that I have ever been forced to sit through.  The story goes that under the streets of Racoon City there is a secret facility (The Hive) controlled by Umbrella (a massive pharmacutical company) which is designed for creating vast viral weaponry. An outbreak occurs turing all the staff into flesh hungry zombies.  Now to get to the aspects of the film that made it so god-awful. I'm pretty much going to ruin the ending for anyone reading further than here so if you haven't seen the film and actually care about the end don't read any further. Repeat MAJOR SPOILERS!  The outbreak occurs when Spencer shatters a vial of T-virus against a lab table on his way out of the Hive. The icicle virus melts, the water evaporates and carries viral particles through the air vents, infecting the entire staff.  Do you have any idea how unrealistic and stupid it is to have a facility where it's cubicles share the same air as laboratories working with Level 4 biohazards?!?  Next, the security team successfully infiltrates the Hive in order to stop Red Queen (the main computer) who has killed all the inhabitants in order to contain the outbreak. Does Red Queen greet the Umbrella personnel and explain her actions to them? Does she reveal ANY helpful information to these people who in all respects she should view as her masters?? NO! First she slaughters half the team in a laser grid based trap, and says "You're all going to die down here." The laser trap was stupid because there is an area of about 3 feet by the entrance to Red Queen's chamber where the laser grids can't reach. The leader of the security group is safe for a bit and actually backs up so he can get cut to pieces like the rest of his team.  Then after all the zombies have been released, you see these shambling corpses with bite marks, and half eaten faces. This makes no sense as everyone was killed by Red Queen at the same time. So they all should have become zombies at the same time, which would give them no reason to feed on one another.  The whole Alice in Wonderland fixation is a waste as well. Elevator behind the mirror (looking glass), main character's name (Alice), going underground/down the rabbit hole), Red Queen. This doesn't help to forward or support the storyline in any way. It was all fun and cryptic in The Matrix, but it's pretty obvious the story writers just ripped it off.  This movie was the worst zombie film I have seen next to RE Apocalypse. This movie isn't worth buying, it isn't worth renting, it isn't worth the DVD is was burned to. Save you cash and your time.
0 ||| I could not believe how bad this movie was!  Paul Anderson made AvP a bad movie, but I didn't know he could possibly write something this bad.  He even goes as far as stealing the "We are assets, expendable assets" line from Predator and "Newt, I like that" line from Aliens (although it's "Angie, I like that").  There is no reason for the audience to care about any of the characters as there is only one returning from the original movie and the rest are just thrown in for thrills.  Jill Valentine's inclusion is absurd and pointless as the first movie had nothing to do with the characters from the games, so why include them in the sequel?  Alice from the first movie is equally two-dimensional as she has suffered a complete pointless personality change.  She protested killing people after they were bitten in the first movie, but the first thing she does when that happens to someone in this is point a gun at them and prepare to fire.  Yeah, I know it's terrible.  This is the most illogical movie of all time.  Why would Alice drive her motorcycle through the stain-glass window of a church instead of walking through the door, and how did she even know how to get in there?  Why didn't Alice simply kick the villain's butt when he said "Fight him" and she said "no".  Moments earlier she had killed several guards with relative ease, but now she couldn't do it?  I don't think so.  I cannot believe that this story was bought and actually green-lit to be made into a feature film.  That's the most ridiculous thing of all time and after Ghosts of Mars and this movie Screen Gems' credibility has just fallen to rock bottom.  No wonder Paul Anderson didn't direct this, he must have known that it was one of the worst films of 2004 before it was even made.
1 ||| Shocking! Of course, i tried to take it on it's good points. Before i saw it i was looking forward to seeing the movies translation of nemesis. It was CRAP! There's no other word for it, sorry to anyone who may have found that rude, but it was a big guy in a suit. The movies neither scared me, thrilled me, or even interested me at parts. But as i always say, it may be to some people's liking so check it out if you liked the first one. All in all, i didn't like either. I'm glad i still have the games to give it a good name. Enjoy!
1 ||| That was me vomitting from this movie. Not because it's gross but because it's just...sigh...there isn't a word for this.  I am almost certain that the majority of these people that write this crap in movies are drunk, horney, 13 year old's. It's sick that these people make tons of money to produce meaningless garbage. I loved the video games and these movies were nothing like it. Nothing.  Were any of you aware that George Romero (like I have to say it...but the creator of Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead) wrote a screen play for the first Resident Evil. I've read it and it rocked, it had characters from the game in it and everything, but noooooOooOo. They had to go Hollywood and use the script that someone puked on and called it a movie. I'm just tired of seeing this crap made when there is a true horror genius out there that no one wants to hear from.  Don't buy or rent any of the R.E.'s go to the video store or Best Buy and buy or rent "Night", "Dawn" and "Day"...even the Tom Savini "Night" remake that rocked too, then see Land of the Dead. Those movies will show you what can be accomplished when you put a little heart into your movies.  It's just sad that they can take something so good and just reduce it to utter crap.  I gave it 2 stars because at least the zombies didn't run.
1 ||| That's not really true. I didn't find this movie all that mind blowing.  Realistically, noone expects this movie to win any oscars. However, it is a little bit funner than most of Paul W.S. Anderson's other masterpieces. The thing is, you will be laughing at the action rather than be exhilarated by it. My favorite part in the movie is when they take a shortcut through a cemetary. It's priceless.  The only bad part about the movie, besides the script, acting, and plot, is the fact that our heroine is now super-human like. She just seems impossible to defeat as she can kill a million zombies with her kung fu abilities.
1 ||| The first Resident Evil movie was a homage to zombie movies that have gone before.  And Aliens.  And a few other movies thrown in for good measure.  It had a creepy girl, zombies, long-tongued monsters, carnivorous dogs, and Alice (Milla Jovovich) with lots of firepower.  Resident Evil: Apocalypse has all of those things, but none of the spunk.  Where the first movie had a relentless ambiance of terror, Apocalypse is a juiced up action horror without much horror.  PLEASE NOTE: This review contains spoilers, but that's sort of like saying "water might be wet"--everything I explain here is painfully obvious from the start of the film.  So read at your own risk, but you're not risking much...  Where we last left Alice, she and the other survivor of the movie, Matt Addison (Eric Mabius), were captured by the evil Umbrella Corporation for experimentation.  When she awoke, nobody was left alive in the hospital (shades of 28 Days Later).  So Alice does what she always does in an uncertain situation...she grabs a shotgun.  Meanwhile, the entire city has been infected with the T-virus, a biological weapon that 1) mutates Alice into a superhuman killing machine, 2) turns poor Matt into Nemesis, a muscle-bound gun-toting juggernaut, 3) turns people into zombies, 4) turns dogs into zombies, 5) allows a little girl (Angie Ashford, played by Sophie Vavasseur) to walk, 6) did I mention it turns people into zombies?  So what does Umbrella do?  What all authorities do in a zombie movie: they seal off Raccoon City and call in the nukes (shades of Return of the Living Dead).  Also running about trapped in the city is a cast of stereotypes: the hot police chick (Jill Valentine, played by Sienna Guillory who fails miserably at disguising her British accent), the hot military dude (Carlos Olivera, played by Oded Fehr), and the funny black guy who swears a lot (L.J., played by Mike Epps).  After lots of grandstanding, swearing, amazingly accurate zombie head shots, and a lot of confusion, the plot finally gets going when Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) gives them a mission.  Using his amazing "personnel locator" that only seems to work for Dr. Ashford, he discovers that Angie is holed up in her school, all by herself.  We're not sure exactly how this is possible, but never you mind...what matters is Ashford hacks into the entire Raccoon City network and is able to view what's going on from every video camera and microphone.  He then calls our heroes with a deal: if they agree to get his little girl out of the city, he will tell them how to escape.  The means of escape is through a helicopter.  That's it.  That's the big plan.  Hijack a helicopter.  But of course, it's all a trap, and ultimately Alice and Nemesis must duke it out...for some reason.  Something about the perfect weapon, yadda yadda.  There are a lot of neat graphical touches throughout the film.  Alice's bullets have little Umbrella Corp. icons on them.  The helicopters are painted with the Umbrella Corp. logo.  And the end of the film (and subsequent cover-up of the nuclear blast) is entertaining in the same way that the rise of a zombie outbreak was entertaining in Shaun of the Dead.  Which is to say it's awful, but you enjoy it anyway.  But that's it.  Alice is far too much of a superhero to make us feel concerned about her survival.  There are too many characters to keep track of without enough plot development to care about them (Carlos seems to have no actual value at all, less so than even L.J.'s offensive portrayal as a black gangsta). And for some reason, Alice's every move is punctuated by a whiplash sound that quickly gets tiresome.  There's a lot of slow motion action sequences, a lot of blue lensing, and a lot of freeze-frame shots of weapons dropping to the ground. The director (Alexander Witt) is new to directing a film on his own.  He doesn't seem to know what to do with Paul W.S. Anderson's script, and it shows.  The movie drags on and on and on long after it should end, such that it feels a lot like you're watching the third film (an inevitability).  By that time I had lost interest.  When the most interesting part of a film is Jill Valentine's miniskirt, it's hard to care about Alice's fate.
1 ||| "The Prince of Tides" is my favorite novel.  This movie has very little to do with the book.  Taking this story out of South Carolina and putting it in New York city was the worst idea in the history of Hollywood until some genius decided to take "Sex and the City" out of New York city and move it to Abu Dhabi.  This is also the movie that exposed the severe limits of Nick Nolte's acting abilities.  The only thing worse than his laughably fake and inaccurate southern accent is his "performance", which is nothing more than a lesson in how to overact.  He somehow managed to take the Tom Wingo character from the novel and turn him into a completely unsympathetic jerk.  If I hated the movie so much, why 2 stars instead of 1?  Simply put, there are two scenes in this movie worth watching.  The opening scene of the Lowcountry marshland and the last scene showing Nolte driving a car over that same marshland.  Everything in between is simply horrible.  The last person in the world who should have directed this movie was Barbra Streisand.  She is undeniably one of the great talents of our time, but this was a mis-match.  It should have been directed by someone who is from the south and who understands the south.  And Tom Wingo should have been played by a southerner - or at the very least an actor who has mastered the southern accent.  Skip this piece of garbage and read the book.
1 ||| John Huston once said that a good story should have "excitement,color, spectacle and humor, adventure, high drama, tragedy, good conversation, truth and irony". Unfortunately the discerning viewer won't find much of any of those qualities in "Resident Evil: Apocalypse". What they will find is a mildly entertaining spectacle of excess. There is enough tension to keep you watching, but when it finally ends and your mind recovers from its numbness, you will wish that you had not bothered.  The ending is both familiar and predictable, at least to anyone over age six. Apparently predictability is comforting to the movie genre's core fan base, in much the same way as it is for a young child watching "Beauty and the Beast" over and over again. They know the ending so the initial viewing does not scare them, and the repeated viewings give them a feeling of power and control as if they are determining the outcome each time they watch it.  The authors of the DVD expect multiple viewings as they provide three separate commentaries on the disc. A director producer/commentary, a cast commentary, and a writer/producer commentary. More terrifying than anything in the movie is the thought of listening to ALL these commentaries. Sometimes the degree of conceit and self-delusion exhibited by those close to a movie is astonishing. Do they actually believe that this unoriginal exercise in excess is worthy of even one commentary. If you can't make better stuff than this (editor and production designer excluded) you should go back to school and get your CPA.  Finally John Huston would say that it doesn't hurt to have lovable hero's in your story. Lovable heroines wouldn't hurt either or at least ones that look sexy. Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory are attractive women but if they chose their own costumes (?) for this movie they are also airheads.  Like many women they dress in what they think makes them look sexy. The result is a 6th Street hooker look that makes you laugh every time they appear in the frame. Check out Milla's "Zoolander" look if you want to see what could have been; she actually looks sexier wearing old army fatigues in "Dummy" than she does in her "Resident Evil-Apocalypse" outfits.  Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
1 ||| The chorus goes "Have you met writer/director Paul WS Anderson? He's the biggest hack in the whole wide world, if there ever was a hack, he'd be the biggest hack, he's a big fat big fat stupid hack! Hack hack hack hack hack hack he's a stupid hack!" Well you get the idea.   REA was supposed to be the film that addressed the problems of the ill fated poorly received original RE movie, and while this film is significantly better it still falls flat on its face, and completely lacks the artistic integrity of the game on which it is based.   Jill Valentine, and Nemesis, and a couple others FINALLY appear in an RE movie. That's where the good news ends, however, as the film once again forces this useless Alice character into a spotlight that belonged to Jill, Chris, Leon, and Claire. The movie forces itself into the already complex plot of RE Nemesis (PS1, GCN, DC, PC). Sadly it negates the fantastic frantic storyline of the source material and instead focuses on two moody women who would never get dates in real life because their attitudes make them completely unattractive. Jill and Alice were both written as though they were the same character, and both were played out like they would get into a serious cat fight at the drop of a hat. I didn't buy that Jill would rescue Alice at the end because I never got the impression that they were getting along. But its hard to get along with yourself, really... these two were identical in attitude, tone (which was just awful) and even their posture! Not only that, but Jill in the movie was NOT the Jill from the game. They may have put her in the same costume, gave her the same name, but the way Jill came across in the movie is completely different from her superior video game counter part.   What it boils down to is this, game fans want to see the story of their favorite games brought to the big screen true to form. We never asked for Alice, we don't want Alice, drop kick Alice! Let's make the next one based on the magnificent RE4, let's get good actors in there, and let's get a writer that can actually write instead of just hack his way through a script. PWS Anderson is the biggest hack in Hollywood and people need to stop giving that guy projects. He ruins everything he touches. This one's not even worth playing MST3K to.
1 ||| Now, the first Resident Evil movie, I didn't see.  But hey, I've got friends who liked it, so I went along to watch Apocalypse with them.  They all liked it, and they can't seem to understand why I didn't like this movie as much as they did.  Yes, surprisingly, the movie is close to the games, but it's cheesy and forgets that while it's a movie, things do need to make sense before you can mess them up.  I was pleasantly surprised at least, that the movie does manage to help me learn the gist of what happened in the first one.  Now I don't have to watch it.  But the first problem with the movie is that it jumps into the plot right away.  No build up (people say this is scary?  all the good horror movies have some sort of build up and suspense, for an example: watch Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining"), which makes the film not scary at all.  The action sequences were tiring at most.  Too flashy and perfect.  It also seems that characters don't have to have knowlegde of where characters are to find them.  For example, Jill and company are fighting off a group of lickers in the church when Alice comes riding through the cathedral on a motorcyle.  She's completely in gear and ready to go, doesn't sustain any wounds from the glass, manages to flip off the bike and kill all the lickers.  But she somehow knew Jill and company were there.  How?  Forget how cool her entrance was!  And then she manages to KNOW them all?  I'll give the movie this though.  Anyone who was a big fan of Resident Evil 3 will appreciate the costume design for Jill and will REALLY enjoy seeing Nemesis on camara.  Even though the plot twist at the end is predictable (OH MY GOD!  Nemesis is Allice's old partner?  you mean we WEREN'T supposed to see that coming?), it was pulled off pretty well.  It was also stupid that Nemesis ends up helping our main protagonists through a disneylike "Yeah, we used to be buds" moment.  In the game Nemesis was a relentless bio-weapon that had no feelings or emotions.  Really, I'm not sure why this is such a popular movie among my peers.  It's mindless, and the parts that should be funny aren't.  There was nothing really memorable about the film.  For an action film it's shallow, weak, and the main action heroine is much too perfect.  Was John McClane in Die Hard perfect?  Nope, he still got wounded.  For horror, the movie isn't scary.  Too much of it is ruined by building up too much suspesne.  It comes off as more of a "OK, let's take bets.  Who is going to die next?"  Really, this isn't a "horrible" movie, just a "bad" one.  Go on and buy it if you enjoy a lot of mindless action.  But if you're like me, mindless action DOES have to make a little bit of sense, or else it isn't "mindless" it's just "stupid".
0 ||| I liked the first Resident Evil, the visual style, the camera angles, the lighting, the characters, the casting, the sound track. The fact that they tried to stay true to certain aspects of the video game like the Train, and the scene where the guy was crawling towards Mia Jovavich was right out of the video game. Plus I liked the flow of the movie. I wasn't that impress when I first watched it but I find my self going back to it and watching it time and time again. The second Resident Evil (apocolypse) is alot different. poor lighting, quick flashy camera work(can you say music video) the movie has no flow, the music sounds like some old nintendo video game music, the cheesy one liner attempts, it just seemed like a bunch of action sequences that had no connection to each other, the flow of the movie was bad. I wish I would have rented this one instead of buying it. This was also the first DVD that the special features are actually better than the Movie itself.
0 ||| This is not so much a movie as it it simply @$$ kisser to the fans of the game. Plot ides traight out of every zombie movie ever made,charaters either appear and die or jsut live to say stupid tough guy dialogue. The movie wouldve seemed lame at any point in time with plotholes the size of craters. The movie tries to cram alot plot in for the lack of anything inovlving charchter. But i guess what can you expect, not much, since almost every video game to movie has sucked. The first one was bad, this one even worse. The movie seems achingly stale and repetive with some of the msot heavy handed action scenes complete with stale bullet time effects and slo motion and fast motion effects that have gone past expiration date. everything adds to ntohing. jsut maybe some geeks wet dream of the game coming to life. as a movie its hacked to pieces
1 ||| From my experience, all sci-fi films need one very important ingredient... and this is ATMOSPHERE. Its the foundation block for all great movies in this genre. From classics like Star Wars to new favourites like The Matrix. They tell not just a story, but also of a world different to the one we reside in. That is the heart of a great sci-fi. Without it, characters, plot, nor action can develop. This is where Resident Evil Apocalypse falls apart. From the beginning we are rushed into an established storyline. It begins with a few words from the narrator, explaining the damage already done... and instantly we are expected to follow the paper-thin characters on their journey to righteousness. Its difficult to really care, when we are given little time to absorb the horror of a city under fire. Scenes flip from one character to another, each with a separate agenda. Everything is robotic, human interaction and emotion is minimal and the impact of armageddon is ignored. Its derivative, ironcially much like a computer game, you get bitten... its game over. That is it.  The influences are all there, simplified, squeazed and chopped together.  'Dawn of the Dead' a generic town is ravaged by a zombie outbrake shown in a TV report like fashion  '28 Days later' she wakes in a deserted hospital  'Terminator' dressed in a full leather with a mini gun.  'Robo cop' Remembers friend and defies command to KILL  'Tomb Raider' Girl with two guns wrapped around her thigh  'Aliens' aliens  'Matrix' the action  In the end, it has little originalty, and fails to improve on past formula. Post Viral-Apocalyptic films like Omega Man, Dawn of the dead series and 28 Days Later do a much superior job in creating a world in chaos.. the hysteria, tension, loneliness, despair, humour. That was riveting.  Frankly, I couldn't care less about RACOON city.
0 ||| This is one of the worst zombie movies I have ever seen in my life, and that includes the original Night of the Living Dead.  Apocalypse shows me a crew of people who are supposed to be converting a video game to a movie, and instead decide to screw logic, reason, and sanity, and just make a movie that will catter to devout, die hard fans of the series. Why does the story have to make sense?? Just slap Resident Evil on the cover and people will pay.  The story begins where the first RE left off. Alice is awakening in an Umbrella hospital and realizes the world is not what she knew. Things are...well they're sh*t Most people are either dead or undead, and the police are trying to create an effective resistance against the zombies. Hotshot, loss cannon S.T.A.R.S cop Jill Valentine takes leave of her suspension and walks into the RPD just in time to cap a few zombies. She then reminds everyone in a tone that is up to par with porn star acting "They're infected, you have to shoot them  in the head."  Oh but it get's even better when Jill, her partner, and a reporter are trapped inside a church with two lickers. Alice bursts in on a motorcycle to save the day and the first question I have is, "How did she know they were there?"  Then they all get to battle hand to hand with a bunch of rotting graveyard zombies which is funny because A. How did the T-virus infect the already-dead-6ft-burried corpses? and B. why did they choose THAT moment to unearth themselves? The choreagraphy looks good, but then again it's hard to not look like a bad ass when your opponent makes no attempt to defend himself.  Later after making a deal with the lead scientist for a ticket out of this nightmare, they go to a school to retrieve his daughter as their part of the arrangement. Low on people and ammo in a school full of zombie kids, they do the smart thing and split up which means; yep you guessed it someone is going to die.  I loved the scene where they find out a nuke is coming to destroy the city. Jill asks, "What Yield" Alice, "50 Megatons" Jill, "!@$! me" Now, how does a police officer know the difference between nuclear yields..and WHY does it matter! It's a nuke! I don't think Umbrella intends on destroying half the city.  Watching Nemesis was just sad. Why is he after S.T.A.R.S members? In the video game it was because they were out to expose Umbrella's dirty secret. In the movie its...."because they're the best." stupid stupid...  Resident Evil is how a zombie movie should never be done. Horrible acting, a storyline full of holes and inconsistencies, and the feeling that the creators of this "movie" cared more about counting the money it would make rather than making somthing decent give this movie the 1 star is most certainly deserves. Rent it if you want a good laugh, and if you want to watch a decent zombie flick try the new Dawn of the Dead.
0 ||| There was a time, long, long ago when the Silver Screen was reserved for for classics, for art, for the Golden Age of Hollywood. Those days are long gone. But at least movies had that special time. Video Games will never be regarded in this way. No matter how realistic and frightening the Resident Evil games can be the world of gaming will never be able to shed the geeky image of friendless, degenerate nerds playing for 11-hours straight. There's no glamour or admiration to be had here. And with the worlds of movies and video games merging closer and closer together (whether we like it or not) we can only expect a Sonic the Hedgehog live action movie soon (and some studio exec will probably cast Ben Affleck in the title role). I may sound like I'm talking nonsense, but, when you think about it...not really. We've already had a Super Mario Bros. movie and Double Dragon and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and Alone in the Dark.  The first Resident Evil movie was no classic that's for damn sure but it's still a far superior film to this drek. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is so wantonly awful it's almost on par with House of the Dead. No joke! These zombies are not scary! At all! Dawn of the Dead this ain't.  For an R-rated movie the violence is blurred and confusing, why even bother with the swearing if that is really all that is keeping it from being a PG-13? It's shot and cut with no skill whatsoever. The plot makes no sense at all and there are frequent gaps in logic that even the most ignorant viewer can point out. Like why do the long-dead people in the graveyard (conveniently buried underneath only a few centimetres of loose dirt) suddenly come back to life when the T-virus is only supposed to be transfered through blood infection? And that was only just one part of a 'plot' that was constant nonsense. And by the end it was so far removed from the (better) story of the video games that the 'Resident Evil' title is really no more than a way of selling nonsense to people who expect and deserve something else.  Don't get me started on the characters! All I can say about them is that they might as well have been polygons. I know I'm not being really original when I say this movie is like watching a bunch of cut-scenes from a video game but...it is. It is totally NOT worth your time or money. Do not even give in to curiosity.  The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and (my version had) Dolby EX/DTS ES 6.1 sound. Plus a bunch of extras I care not for.
0 ||| I watched it till the middle and wanted to throw it away. I't's an insult to the game. The acting was terrible. The story line was obvious and uninteresting. It was generally meant for those who had played the game.but I can promise you that if you have played resident evil three, you will find nothing to intrest you here. The game has more drama, more suspense more interesting and intelligent twists that the movie appalingly lacked. In my oppinion the movie itself was a good introduction, I hope the next movie will take up from there and give us something worth watching!!!!
0 ||| is it that hard to make a video game into a movie? resident evil should have been the perfect film series. the resident evil games have the following scary movie ingredients:a giant spooky mansion/zombies/zombie dogs/gore/mutated animals/evil dead style splatter combat/freakish characters/gore/gore/GORE!The first resident evil "film" was weak,at best.this one... is not has good.the very best thing about it is milla jovovich.she alone boosts this "film" to a watchable level.every other character is...whats lower than cardboard cut out? the nemesis is okay until that god awful hand to hand fight towards the end.and the zombie attacks are sad,they use this cheap camera trick to slow @ blur them,bad acting or bad makeup,the gory cheap flicks get that one right.and the cemetary sequence was just awful and didn't fit the "film".the editing was the worst i have ever seen,and why does the mpaa allow films like saving private ryan,black hawk down,and shindlers list to show what ever they want and get an "R" rating.those are real events and real people.these type of flicks,horror flicks are pure fantasy but you cant see a zombie chew on a guys guts unless its a unrated 20 year old romero film.
0 ||| First of all the CG sucked. Second, Michelle Rodriguez can't act. She rolls her eyes to the back of her head with every line as if to make it more intense and stronger, it doesn't work. The movie doesn't really follow the game much. And although I never thought about this until I heard someone else say it, why would the computer send out all those little lasers and not just the "net laser" if it's job was to kill any and everything? The answer is, so they can include more unecessary action without incorporating it more smoothly and intelligently.  If you want to see a good zombie flick, rent the original Night of the Living Dead.
0 ||| The first movie was very good although it did not have the same impact as the game did. This sequal however was the worst piece of storytelling I have seen on screen.  Don't waste your money...
0 ||| What is this trash?  Anyone who thinks this movie is any good must be insane.  I don't care who liked the videogame, this is supposed to be a movie.  The dim-witted plot is carried out so drudgingly, it bores me to tears.  How superficial can a film be?  This kind of trash is only suitable for possessed retards with anxiety dysfunctions.  The movie deserves not only the lowest rating possible, but it begs submission to the Golden Turkey Award, where it would gladly see some glory.  Either that or the makers should have their heads examined.  For the parents with genuine concerns that gullibly think videogame violence is the root of leading teens astray and decide to connect this movie to it, this piece of unadulterated garbage is a three-pointer for them.
1 ||| i didn't have high expectations to be crushed simply because this isn't that kind of franchise.this isn't like the disaster AvsP is.nothing is.but this is a typical big budget action/horror movie.i don't beleive in leaving my brain,the most important part of most movie goers,at the door,but i didn't have to.i kinda got the gist from part one and this continues from that well.if i were a rabid R/E fan then maybe i would be more thrilled with this.video games turned into movies doesnt really get my undying attention.something about it seems for lack of a better word,''fake''.i liked it enough where as i wasn't bored.i took whatever i saw for granted,i didn't get a headache if everything didn't make sense.so on those terms,its not a bad movie,coming from a person not a R/E fan to begin with.
1 ||| This is the first movie in the supposed Resident Evil trilogy and so far, things aren't off to a great start.   For a horror movie, it borders on all-right to bad. For a movie based on a video game it's pretty bad. Not much from the original games is really intact in this movie.  Mainly just the monsters and some of the lab type levels from the first two games are intact, but thats were the comparisons end. Although, to give the director credit, he did say this movie was more of a prequel to the games, rather then a movie version.   Horror movie wise, there isn't that many great moments in the movie. The zombies are mediocre, I'd take Romero or Jackson zombies over these ones any day.  They're just not that frightning and they don't do a whole lot.  The part with the dogs is fairly decent, but the licker at the end of the movie is just plain laughable and crappy. The budget wasn't very big for this movie, but I've seen TV movies with better special effects then this movies licker. Although I must admit, the part where they're trapped in the corridor with lazers that our out of control, is one of those "wow" moments of horror movies.   The characters are one dimensional and not very fun. Milla doesn't seem to comfortable in her role yet, but that changes in the second movie. Other characters in the movie could live or die without the audience caring much, unless you're like me and would rather just see them all die. The story is descent enough for what this movie is, but it's nothing to write home about.   Overall, it's all right, but I'd stick with the 2nd movie, Resident Evil: Apocalypse for a better time being entertained.
1 ||| I love resident evil, and the first movie is one of my favorites.  This movie was such a huge let down. First off the Directing was horrid. The action sequences scream of low quality. The director uses quick jagged camera movements to obscure the action in the movie and give the moive a "sense" of action, but people who are used to the matrix/jackie chane show whats going on aspects of a fight sequnce will be aggrivated with the final show down.  Ontop of that the movie down right STEALS from the various RE stroy lines. and re-writes resident evil 3 completly,.  I much rather have had a RE type story or one that could have ran parrel much like the first movie. In stead we get whole a scene stolen from RE code veronica and they actually look less stunning. If it wasn't a complete rip off (say if the character was the same) it wouldn't have been so glaringly bad, but when you go to see a movie you go to see "new" thoughts and ideas not just shifted image stolen from video games with different characters doing things that run logically against the game that the images are being stolen from.  An ok movie for people who have never played the game..  But the action super hero twist and rip-off only serve to tarnish the fact that its supposed to be a "resident evil" movie. The director probably should have looked at some of the movies that RE borrwed from before he went about trying to turn this into a horrible wanna be super hero flick
1 ||| I have to admit I loved the first film.  It was one of the few films that I thought best represented the video game that it accompanied.  Milla was perfectly cast as the lead and the non-linear structure of the film allowed us to see the who, what, where, when, and why of the events.  There was just the right amount of terror, the right amount of action, and a whole bunch of originality.  I wish, I really wish that I could say the same about it sequel.  As the credits rolled and we were brought back up to speed from the last events that occurred in the original only to discover that a new director had decided to helm this project and was obviously handed more money and forced to follow the footsteps of Hollywood.  Everything from the original was lost and discarded as a mainstream horror film with maybe zombies (couldn't tell due to the blurry nature of which they ran) moved in to take its place.  More money was on the table with, in this case, meant more explosions and less story.  A disgrace to the name of both the video game and the original film came in several ways with this inferior sequel, mainly horrible acting, cliched characters, a recycled plot, and especially with a amateurish, craft sale created monster known as the Nemesis.  To begin the characters were very disrespectful to the original.  I remember hearing of this sequel and hoping they would build more on Milla character, giving her more to work with and more past stories of her time at the Umbrella Corporation.  I was a hopeful viewer who wished for more deeply rooted characters with many layers, but found the Hollywood clich instead.  The entire character known as LJ could have been eliminated with the greatest of ease and without any remorse.  His lines were the epitome of every other zombie film created while trying to bring his own game references into a franchise that was doing well on its own (the GTA line nearly took my rage over the top).  Like any good supporter of films and video games, I don't mind when they bring in more characters from the series, but let us know who they are first.  There was no introduction to Valentine for those less familiar with the series other than she knows how to shoot zombies and she was disbarred from the force (see the writing on the wall).  This goes the same for Carlos, who just wandered through his part without really contributing anything worth while, and Nicholai, whom I always considered another villain of the series.  Oh well, I guess when tons of Hollywood cash is being thrown in your direction, you can just go crazy with creativity and forget the basis of your film.  Yet again, who am I to say?  Milla was the only one worth watching in this entire film, and even her character seemed to be turning to cardboard by the end.  It was a sad change of events for the Resident Evil group.  The bad acting was the only trouble with this film, the horrible script allowed the Hollywood character and plot clichs to pour in like the flood gates had been opened.  The wise cracking character that always has something to say and obscure pop culture references that try to gain a couple laughs from the audience was present.  The no-nonsense female cop that has a strange past, but finds out that she has the heart of gold.  The corporation boss that is willing to kill everyone for the sake of science and proves that he has no heart what so ever.  Finally, there is the large overbearing monster that was nothing more than table scraps of every other Hollywood big budget horror movie, which discovers the true meaning of Christmas.  YUK.  Could director Alexander Witt either not do his homework or just try for once to build upon the original instead of slicing and dicing.  Not just the characters were clich, but also the story.  Lines were replaced with explosions and CGI.  Gore replaced the sci-fi element and 1984 Big Brother moments were just the mother load.  Seriously, I would love to know what happened.  I would like to end this review by saying that I laughed at Nemesis the entire time it was on screen.  For any of you that did not, I question your sanity.  The reality, if that is what you want to call it, the creative imagination of the original was lost when Nemesis made his screen debut.  It was sloppy and cheap.  Definitely not something for Witt to be proud of.  Overall, this was not a crowning achievement for the series.  The themes were jumbled mess of save humanity and science is bad.  Milla did the best with what she was handed providing some of the better parts of the film, but everyone else were just worthless.  I hope that the makers of this film see the error in their ways and the fact that they completely butchered a great concept.  Video games are an amazing source of imagination, but sometimes when Hollywood money becomes involved, you get projects like Resident Evil: Apocalypse.  I loved the video games, but after the original, this series needs to tighten up to regain control.  Grade: ** out of *****
1 ||| Sorry guys, bear with me, this is a long review, but if you want to know why I gave two stars you will have to read the entire thing.  Let me first state that unlike many people, especially fans of the Resident Evil game series, I thoroughly enjoyed the first Resident Evil movie and although it wasn't anything too special or original, I felt the it was a solid action/sci-fi/zombie/horror movie which never really went wrong.  RE - Apocalpyse however disappointed me numerous times.  I excepted a generic plot, I expected Matrix style action, I expected hordes of zombies, I expected a lot of things, what I didn't expect were some lame scenes and a lazy plot wrap up.  The gist of the story is that a zombie creating virus has infected the Umbrella Corporation's secret research facility known as The Hive which resides underneath the city of Racoon City (the events of the first movie).  Of course a science team goes to reopen the Hive and the bad stuff escapes, no problem there.  All of Racoon City starts to get infected and all kinds of zombie hell is breaking out everywhere.  Alice our main character wakes up in a "hospital" after her ordeal from the first movie.  By the time she walks outside the city is already officially screwed.  First the things I liked about the movie, I love the Resident theme, I like the action/fighting scenes, I generally like the characters and the acting, there aren't too many lame quotes, there are some decently frightening scenes and the special effects are about as good as you could ask for.  Now what I didn't like.  *SPOILERS*  Some how Umbrella Corporation in less than 24 hours managed to contain the outbreak within a city seamingly the size of Chicago using 30+ foot walls around the entire city.  Allrighty then, in all fairness the Umbrella Corporation knew the virus had infected the Hive, so prior to entering The Hive they could have and should have had safety measures ready to be deployed if the virus escaped into the city.  Okay I guess I can buy that.  There were naturally a couple of scenes that were lame or dumb, such as Alice jumping via motorcycle into the church where the other characters are battling against some Lurkers, not knowing where she was going to land and who she might squish on the other side.  A little bit reckless, but I'll forgive it as a theatrical flair.  And of course if a zombie/undead resurrecting virus gets lose one of the first things you would put on your site seeing list is a stroll through the cemetary, right?  Well our characters did, and of course the buried zombies don't crawl out of their graves until our characters are right dead smack in the middle of the cemetary.  Sigh... well every horror movie has to have the character stupidity moments and maybe the buried zombies didn't have enough willpower to dig themselves out until they started to smell fresh blood standing right on top of them.  All right I'll forgive that stuff.  Then a semi-side plot to whole movie is the conflict between Alice and Nemesis (a huge T-virus mutant).  The Umbrella Corporation wants to see the two battle it out and test each other.  Allright so the two have a couple semi-random encounters which were actually kinda cool, but then we get towards the end of the movie and their "battle" has yet to resolve itself.  So we can't have that.  Rather than have to two stumble across/find each other in some random cool location and end it, an Umbrella Corporation scientist forces the two to literally fight now.  "You and you step forward and end this."  I thought for a second I'd stumbled into a "Mortal Kombat" movie, I expected at anytime to hear the deep gravely voice utter the word FIGHT.  Needless to say the scene was lame.  Once again however ultimately forgivable due to artistic license.  Now we come to the end.  A horrible disease ravaged a city the size of Chicago, a huge 30 ft wall is erected around the entire city (we are talking miles and miles of wall), newspapers lay scattered through the streets with headlines reading "THE DEAD WALK", people struggle to escape the city and many do before Umbrella Corporation puts a stop to it.  To cover this tragedy up Umbrella Corporation touches off a nuclear bomb and claims the power plant had a meltdown.  Fine no problem.  However, some amateur footage of the zombie tragedy ends up in the hands of mainstream news.  Reports of disturbing and shocking footage are aired.  Oh, wait sorry, never mind the whole thing was just a hoax.  All we know is that Racoon City was leveled by a nuclear meltdown.  WHAT?  Are you trying to tell me no one in the outside public knew about this outbreak?  No one noticed the 30 ft wall surrounding a major metropolis?  Newspapers had enough time to release breaking news headlines reading "THE DEAD WALK" and nobody outside heard about it or read these articles?  None of the presumably thousands of earlier escapees told anyone about the tragedy?  None of the remaining people not to mention the reporting local news, government or law enforcement groups made a phone call to the outside world to report what was happening and/or ask for aid and/or say there goodbyes to loved ones, especially in the early hours of the outbreak?  How in the world am I supposed to buy that crap?  If you want a cover story say terrorists released a biological/viral disease and before anyone could figure out what was going on, the nuclear plant had a meltdown and obliterated the entire city and any potential explaination of the virus outbreak.  There both horrible tragedies reported and simply explained and resolved.  But no instead the outside world remains completely ignorant of the zombie disease outbreak. Please.  That my friends is why I didn't like this movie.  It makes the whole plot resolution unbelievable.
0 ||| Let me first take a second just to say that i have never written a movie review in the past, but i am a person that when extremely pleased or highly dissatisfied often feels the need to say something, so here it is: This movie is without a doubt one of the most worst action/horror/scifi/whatever the hell peice of crap kinda movie you want to call it. What bothered me most outside of the huge plot holes was that this movie was a horrid rip of of ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK (which i will add was a much better movie by far than this piece of tripe). What the producers of this movie relied on was the fact that the audience they were going after (young males 16-25) probably have never seen or heard of the movie ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK thus wouldnt know that there wasn't one single fresh or original idea in the whole movie. Yes it was nice seeing Alice and Valentie (pretty faces and nice bodies to attract the boys) kick some butt, ill admit, but when you actualy go to the lengths of stealing another persons movie idea you'd think they could at least make the plot work (i.e. to reanimate dead bodies they MUST be infected with the T-Virus, yet when the wayward team are running through a grave yard, corpes come up from the ground. Can someone please tell me how they, 1) got out of ther coffins from 6 feet down, and then tell me how they were infected with the T-virus?)I won't bore you with more details of the dreadfulness of this rip off, my only point was to warn any of you Resident Evil 1 fans that were thinking of picking this up (by the way i did like part one)If you really want to see a better version (AND NOT A RIPPED OF PIECE OF GARBAGE) of what was meant in APOCALYSE, rent or buy ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK with Kurt Russell, i think you will be pleasantly surprised.

Just another beautiful day in Raccoon City, but underground the Nemesis has escaped.  Important residents in Raccoon City are visited by two agent men from the Umbrella Corporation telling them at their front door, "There's been an incident".  They are taken in the van immediately.  Their is chaos going on downtown. Officer Jill Valentine (Sienna Gillory) is called in. She enters the Raccoon City Police Department and kills the bio-hazard zombies.   As we saw at the end of the first film, we see Alice (Milla Jovovich) unhooking herself from the operating table and leaving the building. She now stands in the middle of downtown Raccoon City where all the turmoil has just ended.  Later that night, Raccoon City is quarantined. No one is allowed to leave. They must go back home. Valentine, Peyton (Razaaq Adotyi) and Teri (Sandine Holt) are in the church to get away from the zombies. The lickers are running rampant inside. Suddenly, Alice finds a way inside to help.

1 ||| I can't help but wonder how good this film may have been had it had another director, maybe one more attentive to the nature of the story.  Instead, actress/singer/director Barbara Streisand helms this picture, and she does a lot more damage than good.  Instead of creating a film that is rooted in raw emotion and heartbreaking tragedy she turns this film into a longwinded soap opera with over-the-top acting and `romance novel' style dialog.  In fact, the last quarter of the film is so ridiculous that I seriously wanted to vomit amidst all the saccharine facileness.  The film tells the story of Tom Wingo, a southern `good ol' boy' who is troubled by a dark family secret, a secret that has pushed his sister to attempt suicide.  While she lies in a hospital room, Tom ventures to New York and meets his sister's psychiatrist Susan.  Tom is apposed to his sister seeing a shrink, but the more he sees Susan the more he begins to open up, about his life, his wife, his mother and eventually uncovering the family secret that has haunted him for so many years.  The idea behind the film is a good one in my opinion (I have not read the book, although I don't hear good things about it so I don't think I will) but the handling of the material really sidelines the film in my opinion.  Instead of taking a raw and emotional approach to the film, the soap operaish delivery makes light of the tragedy surrounding the film and ultimately turns the serious subject of abuse, suicide and murder into a joke.  All of this weighty material is more or less just a backdrop for Tom and Susan to fall in love and in the end the film makes their relationship the weightiest subject; expecting the audience to swell up with tears at the prospect of them having to leave one another as apposed to the audience being emotionally responsive to the turmoil boiling within Tom's past.  The acting doesn't really help the matter.  I am not a fan of Nick Nolte.  I never have been and never will be.  He has really only delivered a few (countable on one hand) good performances, and this is not one of them.  His over-the-top delivery of Tom's emotions is comical to say the least.  He has one good scene, when he finally breaks down and exposes his past.  It's the only scene where his emotions seem real, and it's the only respectable `scene' in the film (which ends up getting ruined by the overly sentimental `cry in my bosom' closing).  Streisand is better than Nolte, but too clichd.  The only good acting comes from the supporting cast, notably Blythe Danner (who is sorely underused) and Kate Nelligan (who received an Oscar nomination for her performance).  They are not enough to save the film, but they at least prove to add some interest to their scenes.  In the end I can honestly say that `The Prince of Tides' is a missed opportunity, which I think is what makes the sting of the films failure hurt all the more.  It could have been so deep and haunting but instead comes off vapid and hollow.
0 ||| Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a gargantuan bomb of a movie and why do you ask is beacause it is just plain horrible. Bad writing, acting and the action set pieces are mind numbingly crappy and non exciting. This sequel takes place right after the original in the desolate town of Racoon City where the virus has spread even more and the inhabitants become zombies. Just like the first one this suffers but the first one was a notch better in my mind. Starring Mill Jovovich (Resident Evil, The Fifth Element), Oded Fehr (The Mummy and The Mummy Returns), Mike Epps (Next Friday, Friday After Next), Jared Harris (I Shot Andy Warhol, Igby Goes Down) and Alan Tudyk (28 Days, Tv's Firefly). I hated everything about this movie and the Nemesis creature was laugh out loud funny. This bored the hell out of me. I gotta say this goes down the line for being so retarded like Van Helsing was. The chick who played Jill Valentine and the others sprouted some awful dialouge. "im good but not that good" please. For die hard fans of Resident Evil but beware, these people don't know how to make a good movie if it bit them in the ass. I don't really care what other's say..hey, at least I got some taste. This movie is for no-brainers.
1 ||| Barbra Streisand is Lowenstein - a shrink trapped in an unhappy marriage to a violinist (Jeroeme Krabbe) and who ultimately finds salvation in the arms of Tom Wingo (Nick Nolte) the brother of one of her patients, Savanah, who has attempted suicide. This is a love story with plenty of treakle but more than an ounce of vinegar as Tom and Lowenstein hit things off, become lovers, but ultimately part company forever to resolve their differences with their respective spouses. Columbia Tristar has given us a truly awful looking print of this film.  Colors are muddy and undistinguished.  Everything takes on an orange characteristic that is unbecoming to the story.  Night scenes suffer from low contrast levels.  Aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement are all present throughout the print.  Fine grain elements and regular wear and tear have not been cleaned up for this presentation either.  Flesh tones are inaccurately rendered, either too orange or too pink.  There's a considerable loss of fine detail throughout, presumably because of noise reduction equipment used in mastering the print.  The soundtrack is dated, strident, unnatural sounding and very tinny.  It's 2.0 but almost sounding mono in spots while presenting the music at very boisterous listening levels that intrude on an otherwise very subdued audio presentation.  No extras - big surprise.  Columbia's penny pinching started with this release.  You can see where it's lead to by examining my reviews of "The Awful Truth" or "Talk of the Town".  For a studio that entered the DVD race so early on and so prominently, I've little in the way of flattery to offer for its current trend in the digital format! BOTTOM LINE: DON'T BOTHER.
0 ||| This movie was so bad it made me angry. Angry because it should be scary. But this director doesn't even try for horror. He goes for action and he fails at that too. The problem is, this is a director who simply doesn't know how to make a movie. What's the movie about? I'll tell you. There's this super woman, this group of people, a mad scientist and a monster guy and they all run around shooting stuff. There, you don't need to see it now. My favorite scene is when this super sexed up cop enters a room with a little girl and there are zombies in the room and the girl is scared but the cop says not to worry because the zombies are slow and they can just run right around them. HAHAHAHA! That takes any kind of threat out of zombies right there. End the movie now. But no. It drags on through this plot that makes absolutely no sense. Somebody explain to me what the point is of scientists making two monster people and making them battle each other. There's no suspense in this movie, no drama, horrible acting, so-so special effects and no story what so ever.  And it's sad because the Resident Evil games are known to be the scariest games out there. So what the heck is up with this movie?
1 ||| This movie would have been better if they had developed the characters more and stopped trying to cram so much into a relatively short movie.  I do not play the Resident Evil game, but I like movies based on games.  It feels like this movie was created by a committee of game players with ADD.  Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory are hot.  The costumes, weapons, action sequences, etc...are very well done.  Overall, it's a good movie that could have been so much better.
0 ||| I absolutely hated this movie. Resident Evil was the first Playstation game I ever played and I loved it. The game had enough of a plot and storyline that they could have made a MUCH better movie out of it.. if they had even bothered to set the movie in an abandoned Umbrella mansion in the woods, it would have been better. This movie is NOTHING like the game OR the books. I especially hated the cheesy outfit the lead character was wearing.. she was supposed to be a STARS team member, and they don't wear miniskirts for mission gear! HELLO!  The whole thing was just stupid. I hope that the director of this one doesn't try to tackle any of my other favorite Playstation games for movies.. if he tries to come out with Parasite Eve I'll be violently ill.
0 ||| This film is a complete misrepresentation of the book "Prince of Tides." After reaching  of the film I couldn't stomach it any longer, I turned it off. The Prince of Tides is NOT just about the love story between Tom and Susan, it is also about growing up in the South and living amongst a dysfunctional family of abuse and social problems. There was absolutely nothing about Luke in the movie. Which by the way is the REAL Prince of Tides. Tom Wingo (Nolte) is NOT the Prince of Tides as stated in the movie. In fact the poem written by Savannah titled "Prince of Tides" was already written by the time Tom shows up in NY. I hate when Hollywood tries to change the stories they make movies on, such as the newest film, "Count of Monte Cristo", another total misrepresentation of the original story.
0 ||| i have little good to say about this movie.  as a therapist myself, i feel the therapist in this movie was repugnant...totally unethical in sleeping with her patient...obviously an emotionally disturbed woman.  to analyze it just a bit, i can't help but think that it was the writer's fantasy that their therapist have sex with them...any good therapist would tell you that what barbra streisand's character did would ultimately prove very destructive to the patient. yet this movie stated that it was okay for her to have sex with him...because he "wasn't really her patient."  well, for starters, it's equally BAD THERAPY for her to have sex with...a patient's brother...but the fact is, she was treating him LIKE a patient, giving him real sessions and asking him personal questions about himself.  in short, he WAS her patient, and there's no excuse for what she did...it violates all boundaries:  professional, personal and emotional. and i say this movie is immature because clearly the people who made this movie and acted in it had no idea of the real emotional effect such a relationship would have on a character such as nick nolte's. i've worked with patients who have had sex with past therapists, and let me tell you...in the best of cases it proves very disturbing to them in the long run.  it's not a subject to be treated lightly, because it's not, despite what it might look like, a romance.  in fact, it's much closer to incest. sick, sick movie.  and scary (but perhaps not surprising) that it became so popular in america. and by the way, even if it is a fantasy (a normal one) for people to want to seduce their therapists, it doesn't mean for ONE SECOND that it would be healthy IF THEIR THERAPISTS GIVE IN TO THEIR PATIENTS' WISHES!  the whole point of therapy is that the therapist understands this...and keeps their boundaries, modeling healthy boundaries and limits.
0 ||| I'm not a videogame nut, so I guess I missed this film's 'good' points.  The only redeeming qualities "Resident Evil-Apocalypse" has going for it are CGI effects and stunts.  Nonexistent plot, lousy dialogue (lots of cursing), women running around half or completely naked (while all the men are fully clothed).  Even the zombies were far better done in the recent remake of "Dawn of the Dead".  Milla Jovovich has yet to make an impression on me in any film she has been in.  Movies like this one seem to assume that videogame devotees aren't intelligent enough to deal with such things as decent story, good acting, etc.  Judging by some reviews on this site, maybe the producers of 'Apocalypse' are right.  1 star, and that's stretching it.
1 ||| This movie is quite gastly when compaired to the first resident evil,I mean this movie hade a cheese factor of 8 out of 10 it is quite obvious that there was a differant director who made the movie. if you like the games then stick to the first movie it's much better and so is the video transfer, for some reason they gave this movie a really bad transfer, none of the blacks are black and the color is washed out I was fooling around with my color and brightness controls throughout the whole movie.
0 ||| This is the sequel to 2002 first Resident Evil, which is based on the popular video game series. The movie starts right where the first one left off and you don't have to worry about them messing up any of the plot points because there is no plot to either movie. Instead of plot, you have Jovovich and a few other people running around shooting, stabbing, punching, exploding and basically killing every kind of zombie that happens to cross their path. It is nothing but non-stop action and explosions the perfect thing to watch if you are trying to fall asleep. The zombies spread their plague by biting their victims which makes you wonder why Jovovich and the other women in the movie run around in shorts and tank tops. You could ask, but remember there is no plot so just let it go. Unlike King Arthur, where I was told no one wants to watch a movie with ugly people in it, Resident Evil is filled with ugly people. Really ugly people. It tanked at the box office so therefore, the ugly people rule must be right. The ending leaves the movie wide open for a third installment and I know everyone will be holding their breath until number three hits the big screen.
0 ||| What I mean by "fart in the wind" is that once it's out in the open, it goes away fast, but while it's in the vicinity it's seriously rank. I couldn't get over the fact that the first one was fairly good, and this one just let me down. The story can't decide whether it's going to follow the games' story lines or if it's going to go on it's own. It takes some characters from the games like Jill, Carlos, Sherry, and Nicolei, and makes every single one pointless. Even Alice, who was likable to a certain degree in the first one (at least you want her character to live) but in this one she is just a [jerk]. You really didn't care what characters lived or died in this tradgedy that calls itself a film. Even Jovovich who is a decent actress did a poor job, and don't even get me started on the other actors. Especially the chick who played Jill. Just watch the way she holds her guns. She obviously had no training whatsoever. And Nemesis just look like a pile of poo rapped in armor. He looked so fake! And if you haven't played the games or read the books, you will have no idea whats going on. It never even explained what the S.T.A.R.S were, and therefor leaves all the non-gamers totally clueless.  If you actually liked this movie I recomend: House of the Dead, its a HORRIBLE zombie flick. The worst I have ever seen, actually worse than this one. And if you liked both movies, you have bad taste.  What I learned from Resident Evil: Apocalypse: Nothing, this is a no-brainer.
1 ||| Resident Evil: Apocalypse begins where the first film left off as Raccoon City has become a sweltering pot hole for T-virus infected zombies that seek human flesh to devour.  People seek refuge outside the city as the Umbrella Corporation, which is responsible for the mishap, has risen walls around the city in order to contain the virus within the city.  When it becomes apparent that the T-virus has reached the outer wall the Umbrella Corporation shuts down the passageway out as the remaining people within the city are left to fend for themselves.  One of these people, Alice (Milla Jovovich), has just awakened inside a hospital where she is attached to several different machines that monitored her health, and once again she has to fight for survival.  The struggle for survival turns the film into a roller coaster journey that goes up and down, but unfortunately it seems to stay down most of the time as the action sequences become too cool, almost godlike, which removes any atmosphere of fear, or trepidation that Resident Evil should arise.  The true horror, which was an element in the first film, is wiped out as the film instead attempts to offers a cinematic experience through shoot 'em up action.  There are some interesting scenes such as Alice running down a wall, and the Nemesis attack on the S.T.A.R.S. station, which leaves one survivor.  But overall, Resident Evil: Apocalypse does not provide much fright or scare.  The action sequences, at times, feel awkward and more humorous than suspenseful as the characters are supposed to struggle for survival.  When some poor soul is about to die, it becomes slightly predictable as if some formula was concocted in order to save the film.  The film does not overcome its negatives as in the end the film does fall flat, but there are some highlights in the story.  For example, the film has interesting cinematography, good lightning, and cool special effects.  These positives only make it bearable to view the film as the story seems to be hurried and unfinished.  Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a distilled cinematic version of the video game by Capcom, but the film does not move the near heights of the video game as the film is purely a trip to the shooting range, which leaves an empty feeling within.
1 ||| I'm reviewing this movie because after renting it (thank god!), I had a very good mental vision of how cool this action/horror slasher flick would be, little did I know that dissapointment was just around the corner...I mean, wow, they really screwed up here with one of Playstation's most popular video games in history.  I wanted blood, but there was barely ANY, what were they thinking? Resident Evil is all about the blood 'n the zombies, which mind you, not EVEN ONE get's it's head blown off, which is how you kill them idiots! No wonder Alice's team suffered so much! The most redeeming, interesting part of the movie is the way it tries to give suspense and surprise, it fails on some levels to say the least but it is the best feature.  The way the movie ends is stupid too, it basically ENDS where it should've BEGUN, thus resulting to a tiresome sequel that may I say was a total flop!  Might be pleasing to some, but I've seen better...
1 ||| oh, c'mon, what a load of crap, what a waste...  The first one was good sci-fi/horror movie, good and kind of interesting caracters, good zombies, a good storyline and well directed. Now the second, sorry but this is very bad, i gave two stars because of the action sequences, they were entertaining but that'S it!!  this is sad because the beginning is good, i mean the 20 first minutes are good, all the panic and etc, i won'T spoil it. But after it'S only mindless action with stupids caracters, a lot of zombies and action, but where is the gore, i mean zombies, people with big guns, you see what mean. I will not talk of the storyline, it'S just not very good and so the acting, i know it'S a horror action movie, but it'S not a reason, just watch Dawn of the dead (remake) and Shaun of the dead. 2 recents horrors movies and 2 great movies with good storyline and acting.  There'S some good points of course, good special effects, the pumped soundtrack and two sexy female caracters. :-)!!!!  I'm big horror movie fan, since my childhood and i mean all kind of horror, and i love ZOMBIES. This movie is bad, and personaly and I don'T think this is a good horror movie.  And by the way, the end is pathetic...
1 ||| Hollywood's latest contestant in the video-game-cum-feature-film sweepstakes rears its head in the form of Screen Gems Resident Evil.  Originally Evil was in the hands of zombie guru George A. Romero but ultimately it was not to be, and his latest foray into the zombie arena was momentarily halted.  Currently Romero is in pre-production on the 4th installment of his popular `Dead' series. That aside Resident Evil liberally culls its plot and look from the popular PlayStation discs, classic zombie flicks and Alien-type sci-fi.  But alas Anderson's Evil disappointingly brings very little to the horror fans table.  Is the film all bad? Well, no. On the contrary, the cybernetic sets are slick and well conceived, as are the gored-up, out of control zombie dogs. The script is a notch above par and the soundtrack features music by Crystal Method, Static X, Slipknot and Marilyn Manson. However strong these attributes are they hardly rescue this release from being more run of the mill, teenage drekk.  Fans of Lucio Fulci and/or George Romero's zombie epics will find little redeeming in this sanitary picture. It's appalling that Hollywood can screw up such a simple formula. There's no need for convoluted plots or deep subtext. Merely start with some dead bodies and a gung-ho group of survivalists fused with radiation or good old-fashioned voodoo and you've got yerself the makins' for a zombie marathon. Oh, and you can't forget the blood, lots of blood.  Resident Evil was rated R for "Strong Sci-Fi / Horror Violence, Language, Brief Sexuality / Nudity." Taking the latter first, there was only one fleeting glimpse of a female nipple and some sex-under-the-sheets-in-a-flashback-with-a-strobe-light type of crap. Next up is "Language." I recall but one "F" word and I'm quite sure that many a youngster has spewed-forth much worse while blasting the contaminated undead in the comforts of their parents' homes. Finally the "Strong Violence" - the handling of this aspect distressed me as I soon found that these zombies hardly bled at all. Yep, a near blood-free zombie pic. In the film's defense they did attempt to explain this by saying, "the blood coagulates only after the body is dead." Fine. So now we should see blood clots and splats rather than streams and pools, but we don't. What we see is a whole lot of nothing.  Furthermore, the fast action scenes (i.e. minions of zombies being massacred by 3 people) are obscenely influenced by the stylistic renderings of the MTV age. Any gore that may have been present in these sequences is completely blanketed in an overkill of rapid-fire filmmaking tricks and stunts. So while it may come as a surprise to all 4 (count `em!) of the producers, the jittery camera pans, quick editing, flickering lights and extreme close-ups just make for one unpleasant mess.  It's a sad fact that the video game is more compelling, more fun and a helluva lot bloodier than its cinematic offshoot.  Note: The film's star Milla Jovovich may have experienced some dj vu as she awakens towards the end near naked on a lab table, just as she was at the start of The Fifth Element. Bruce Willis co-starred in The Fifth Element and awoke to a similar predicament in Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys. All roads seem to lead back to Bruce Willis. I don't like that.  By: Christopher Curry
0 ||| Coming off the turkey that was "Alien Vs. Predator", Paul W.S. Anderson swings and misses again with another script full of awful dialouge and cardboard characters. Anderson hands over the directing honors to Alexander Witt on this one but it doesn't make too much of a difference. Witt soaks the film in stylized violence and over-produced CGI but unfortunately, such items as "substance" and "content" were thrown on the back-burner, this time around.  Starting where the original "Resident" left off, "Apocalypse" has Milla Jovovich's Alice trapped in a zombie plague that has engulfed the fictional Racoon City. Along the way she meets up with female rogue cop Jill Valentine, her partner, and a news reporter. Of course, a representitive of the evil Umbrella Corp. is behind it all. To make matters worse, he throws a genetically-enchanced creature called "Nemesis" into the mix. If the cartoonish super-villian subplot about a corporate honcho who fiendishly sacrifices innocent people for the sake of a major advancement in weaponry has ever see more played out and cheesy than it is here, I have yet to see it.  While "Apocalypse" plays out like a mix of "Charlie's Angels" and the "Dawn Of The Dead" remake, it certainly doesn't stop there. It kindly borrows its plot twists and even lifts dialouge from other films as well. While the original film was a promising video game adaption, this sequel is a series of pretty pictures wrapped up in a meaningless story. For all of its influences, you'd think at the very least that "Apocalypse" would make for a decent homage. Sadly, that isn't the case. The treatment of the zombie mytholgy is flimsy and the story feels like it would be better suited for a Saturday morning cartoon series adaption of the movie then a sequel. For all of its faults, if you're looking for a big mindless celebration of action and violence with cheesy dialouge and little of anything else, this could be your cup of tea.
1 ||| Saw Resident Evil 2. Without going into FULL detail, allow me to say this:  What a LOAD!  Tell you what, if you liked the first movie, then watch this only if you want an excuse to create a big budget, blow-every-flipping-thing-up, bridge to another possible sequel.  I swear, Paul Anderson is films version of Piers Anthony (sp?). He doesn't know how to end a movie, so he stops them all on some freaking Joss Weadon cliffhanger.  Y'know Paul, sometimes we WANT endings to our films. We want to be able to have that last sigh of relief when a film ends. We want to feel like something is concluded. We DON'T all want to be left hanging at the end of everyone of your films. Every once and a while is fine, but not EVERY movie. That kind of crap makes me wary of wanting to see the future releases of Driver and Necropolis. Heck, if he WANTED a cliffhanger, he could have stopped the movie 5 minutes from where it did end and I would have been less irritated.  The ending isn't the only fault of this Summer ending fluff. Mila Jovavich was the best actor of the film. Now, while I'm not down playing her growing talent, look at this closer. When your highest-grade actor is an ex-super model, something is wrong. Most of the other actors had some kind of Van Damme ascent and made it hard to understand them alone. The others padded their sub par acting with guns blazing at things (most which weren't zombies, more on that later) or a blazing flurry of F-Words.  It is with that word and the pointless topless scenes that I think garnered the "R" rating, which is pretty flipping sad.  All the characters were stale and you began to not really care if one guy lived or died. When the characters did die, there wasn't ever that feeling of "Aw, man, I really liked him/her too".  Now, I KNOW the Resident Evil series isn't all about zombies. It's not a plain zombie story, sure, but they sure as hell have a lot to do with it. It played a lot into the first movie. THEY were it. THEY were the baddies, while sharing the light with the ONE Licker and the amnesia filled dude with the attitude.  The zombies this round are filler in the film. The movie just seems to flash back at them, as if to say "Oh yeah, they're here too". The Licker was even downplayed as a minimal threat to the people who had guns. In the first, it ransacked everything in sight and began evolving and becoming badder. This time, there's like TEN of them. You're thinking, "Holy crap, they're screwed".  Not necessarily so, Lois.  Instead, one guy gets offed and the rest are either shot, run over, blowed up or Crushed By Christ(TM).  Naturally, our heroes trip into a graveyard all filled with fog (that only seems to be THERE) and one of our "Zombie Reminders" shine as a bunch of dudes pop from the ground and start dancing around with Michael Jackson to bring in the long awaited Thriller 2: Zombie Boogaloo.  Okay, maybe not, but it would make more sense as to why they arrived than the NON reason the movie gave.  Then there's Nemesis. Ah, Nemesis. One of the biggest Baddies of them all. He was mysterious, he was tough, he wore black and he whooped your butt. Now, though, he was more like Frankenstein with a gun. He just kind of lumbered around Raccoon City, making himself known and doing very little. Then there's this hand-to-hand fight he was with Alice that's the equivalent of Nancy Fowler Archer, of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman fame, battling the Stay Puffed Marshmallow Man. They just shuffled about and twitched at each other. I couldn't tell what was going on half the time cause of Paul's EXTREME close-ups, which were, more than likely, hiding the characters physical flaws.  All of this combined makes me want to see the possibility of a three as much as I want to fork over 7.50 to see a third Star Wars.  Very Little.
0 ||| At least, that's what he has implied by ruining both Resident Evil and Aliens vs. Preditor. Why oh why did Sony choose him over George Romero? He had a script ready to go, and then Anderson walked in and offered to do it for less money, and that was that. The same thing can be said about Aliens vs. Preditor. Dream projects like AVP and RE will never be safe so long as Paul Anderson is making movies.  If you want the real Resident Evil expirience, I suggest you play the remake of the first game on Gamecube. If you desire a non-interactive adaptation of the games, read the books. If you must see just how badly Anderson botched up the RE mythology, then by all means see the movies. But be forwarned, they suck. What could have been an excellent horror film adaptation of a classic game turned into a C grade action movie flop.
1 ||| I've never claimed to be an expert on movie-making. Having said that, I think it's fair to say that a movie sequel should have at least *something* that distinguishes it from the first one. Something that spices up the overall story and yet maintains a continuity. Well, you won't see that with "Resident Evil: Apocalypse." Alexander Witt sat in the director's chair for this one, but he may as well change his name to Paul Anderson, because this movie is basically a recycled, watered-down pointless sequel to the first one. Witt brings absolutely nothing new to the table. This might as well just be an hour and a half long prologue to "Resident Evil." Judged on its own merits, this one sinks faster than a ball of lead thrown in a river.  To begin with, just about every cliche in the book is thrown into the mix, including the obligatory multi-racial cast, which of course wouldn't be complete without the loudmouth, wise-cracking nimrod whose only purpose is to provide comic relief. And poorly-timed comic relief, I might add. The script is so atrocious that one could probably follow the entire movie with zero dialogue spoken. And oh yeah, there are plenty of profanities just to make it more "hip." Action sequences are forced and cliched, and pretty much all of them are shown in the trailer. This movie has no flow whatsoever; it's one "shoot 'em up" scene after another. After the millionth zombie shot in the head it gets old real quick. The so-called "scary" scenes are more laughable than frightening. You can see them coming a million miles away. It's not a good sign when the audience is one step ahead of the movie. Many scenes were just flat-out sickening, such as the zombie corpse with worms crawling all over its face. Cheap shock value. And don't even get me started on the "Nemesis" monster. But hey, one good thing was that the guy inside that Halloween rubber suit could at least hide his face and not let anyone know he starred in this movie. I could go on but I think you get the point.  For me, the only enjoyable thing was seeing Milla Jovovich, whom I worship. She's perfect in her role as Alice. But as much as I love you Milla, even you couldn't save it.  Bottom line: "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" is an overly-loud, pointless, cliched, virtually plotless, poorly directed carbon-copy of the first movie, and at least the first one had its moments. Now, I'm a movie-goer who's able to have realistic expectations when walking into the theater. The "Resident Evil" movies are based on a video game for teenagers, so I'm not expecting "Citizen Kane." But come on, there's nothing wrong with having at least SOME iota of intelligence in a movie of this genre. A total waste of time.
1 ||| The sequel to 'Resident Evil' has more actions, to be sure, but the film itself is done with less creativity and originality, repeating what you have seen in other better films featuring the un-deads, or zombies.  (The timing of the release is worst for we have seen recently 'Dawn of the Dead.')  And as to the actions, some must be really good -- I say 'must' because many scenes are poorly directed and edited, with a camerawork that shows the director doens't know how to create exciting fighting sequences, whether they are martial arts or bullet shootings.  Sorry if I sound harsh, but don't say I am missing the point.  I know the film is based on a Capcom game, and I know the story is only an excuse for the heroine Alice (Milla Jovovich who returned from the original) who must fight against a lots of zombies, in Racoon City which always looks like Toronto.  I'm not complaining about it.  Anyway, the Umbrella Corp. very strong company cause the infection of deadly virus that spread all over the city (which has only one bridge to access there), and it should be contained immediately.  Many citizens are turned zombies, who attack the following hapless people -- Beside Alice, tough (suspended) cop Jill (Sienna Guillory, 'Love Actually'), soldier Carlos (Oded Fehr 'The Mummy'), small-time crook LJ (Mike Epps, 'Friday'), newsreporter Terri (Sandrine Holt).  Plus you see Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) and Major Cain (Thomas Kretschmann, 'The Pianist') who controls the military operation ruthlessly.  If you can ignore the numerous plot holes and inconsistent logics, 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' has serious problems with it.  As I said, the fighting sections, which should be the biggest feature of the film, suffer heavily from the inept editing that use too many fast cuts and slanted camera.  Milla Jovovich, physically fit, is fine as the fighting heroine, but the camera fails to capture the essence of her, which was so eloquently shown in 'The Fifth Element.'  To make matters worse, though Milla is as beautiful as ever, the film's confusing (and unfocused) plot somehow refuses to use her to the full.  In fact, you don't see Alice on screen for considerable time, as the film heavy-handedly introduces other characters into the story.  And the way it does is so confusing that you find the film repetitive -- see how many times you have to see some people biting others, which causes inevitable results.  Many have already seen the consequence in the original, so once is fine.  Twice is unnecessary.  There are good things, though.  Sienna Guillory is a standout as the strong-willed police officer, whose acting is perhaps better than the star Milla Jovovich.  Perhaps her roles was cut short (especially the earlier part) because some of her behaviors in the opening parts look too adrupt.  They should not have done that (if they did, I mean).  And Mike Epps gives us a few moments of genuine laughs, which are always welcome to me.  But as a whole 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is a bit disappointment, because of its recycled ideas and mediocre actions.  What if Paul W.S. Anderson (who wrote the script, but went to direct 'Alien vs Predator') directed this?  I don't know, but perhaps, just perhaps, made it more effective than Alexander Witt, who was the second director for pefectly choleographed 'Pirates of the Carribians.'
0 ||| Another movie based on a horror video game francise.  Skip it and save your money unless you are a 13 year old gamer.
1 ||| Based on a computer game, Resident Evil actually looks like a computer game:  the characters run around in a maze-like environment, shooting zombies and mutants while a standard video game soundtrack hums in the background.  There isn't much of a plot, just enough to establish why the zombies are there.  Admittedly, with two characters with amnesia and a possible traitor in the group, there is room for a plot twist, but any revelations are mere diversions from the killings.  With more than a few references to other zombie flicks, particularly Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, Resident Evil doesn't offer anything very new.  The action is passable but nothing special; essentially, anything this movie does, some other movie has already done better.  On the other hand, there is nothing truly bad in this movie: it merely lacks anything good.
0 ||| Gratuitous immoral values... also a huge insult to Joan of Arc
1 ||| The movie is sort of a crossover between the genres of zombies [a la Night of the Living Dead] and artificial intelligence gone wrong [in the mode of one of the less good early X-files episodes]. The result is a mediocre horror flick, with a story not convincing enough and character development far from sophisticated enough for the movie to be even slightly memorable.  The atmosphere is clinical, very much reminiscent of Event Horizon, another movie made by the same director Paul Anderson, only that Event Horizon is a slightly more interesting movie. The movie's sterilized feel is almost devoid of human emotions, even in the one or two forced scenes where the characters are supposed to express sympathy and compassion. Those scenes are ineffective. It feels like the script writers feel compelled to include them only to make sure the audience can distinguish the otherwise cold and expressionless human characters from the zombies and artificial intelligence. The stubborn refusal to develop the characters in any three-dimensional sense is rather annoying.  Even if one treats it as a ride in an amusement park, the movie fails to really deliver. The zombie attacks are clichd, and you could feel that even the cast sometimes shows in the movie their own lack of interests. Humor, in any form, is also conspicuously missing in the movie. Overall, no matter what you are looking for, I would not recommend this movie.
1 ||| this may have been a good movie without Milla Jovovic she is terrible. she plays Joan as a unstable or off her medication type person. Sorry I could not wait for the execution scene,
1 ||| It is a very bad movie about Joan of Arc.  Most of it is fiction.
0 ||| I loved the actors but the theme is very bent and twisted. At the end of the movie it makes it look like Joan was basically a lunatic who was actually receiving visions and revelations from Satan the whole time. Very twisted and uninspiring!
0 ||| horrible! extremely violent, foul language, Joan was made to look like a nut case . . . horrible production!
0 ||| Where to begin, where to begin.  First, Jeanette had three older brothers and a little sister.  Jeanette's sister, Catherine, died giving birth to a child, not as depicted in this film.  Second, Jeanette first heard the Voices in the garden by the house, then she saw a bright light.  The Voices identified themselves as St. Michael, St. Catherine, and St. Margaret.  Jeanette repeatedly tried to save English lives.  The story of Jeanette ("Little Joan"), a 5'2" teenager who led the armies of France inspired by Voices and was burned at the stake would make a marvelous movie or musical.  Whether she was a saint or delusional, the movie could balance the depiction and let the viewer decide.  But what this movie does not capture and what needs to be captured is the pathos of this small, teenage girl abandoned by her country, surrounded by enemies, fighting for her life.  Go read the trial transcripts and base the dialogue on them, not the ridiculous tripe served up in this Joan-bashing movie.
0 ||| Oh man, I don't even know where to start with this review. First of, I should say, that Resident Evil is another botched attempt by a movie company (Screen Gems) to bring another game title to the bring screen. All movies based on game titles have sucked :Final Fantasy, Mortal Kombat are just 2 examples.  In fact, the same idiotic director who made those terrible  Mortal Kombat movies directed this piece of junk!!! Once I knew that, I knew the movie was going to suck. I just didn't how much it would suck, until I saw it. After seeing it, I have to say that Capcom did  probably the most stupidest thing they could have done, by giving the rights for this movie to be made. Furthermore, Capcom, obviously didn't care,  how the director was going to follow the game, because if they had, they would have seen that the film does  horrible injustice to the game. It does not follow up the story and plot to the games. In fact, none of the characters from the game:  Chris Redfield, Claire Redfill, Jill, or Leon, the policeman are in the film. To understand why Resident Evil is a pitiful attempt to bring the game to the screen, you have to know the story in Resident Evil games. An evil corporation called Umbrella, has unwilligenly or willingly (depending on who you ask) has unleashed a virus called the "T virus".  The T virus has the effect, of killing people and then  making them zombies. Even more scary is the fact, that the Umbrella knows about the situation but is covering it up. Only a  handful of corrupt politicians and Umbrella  personnel know about the virus.  In the first RE game, a team of special police  officers, trace the roots of the virus to a mansion,  harboring all sorts of monsters.  In fact, "the scene of the mansion" is in the movie,  but that's one of a few similiarities  between the game and the movie.  Eventually the last survivors of the mansion Chris  Redfield, Jill Valentine escape only to be separated . (...) Birkin is himself infected, by a more powerful virus, and is mutated to another horrible beast.  Eventually all the survivors escape, and thus  stop the Umbrella corporation from doing more damage  to Racoon City. That's basically the Re games.  Sounds cool,doesn't it? The Crappy, Sucky Movie version of Resident Evil The movie starts out in the Umbrella Corporation. Everthing is calm and cool, until an employee drops a chemical container containing the T virus into the floor.  Then all hell breaks loose, because it seems that Umbrella's computer known as the Red Queen, has isolated and captured all of Umbrella's employees and plans to kill them. In fact, some of the death scene in Re are actually pretty good, but most of them are not.  So eventually most of the people in Umbrella die, due  to this supercomputer. LOL. This is garbage that is made up. In the Re games, there is no "Red Queen" that is causing the killing in Racoon City, and in Umbrella. The killing is brought upon by the heads of Umbrella, and corrupt politicians, who have knowingly released the virus and are trying to cover it up.  Instead, we get Milla Jolladovich, playing some drugged out,security officer named Alice Prospero. Then comes the ridiculous plot of the movie, which is that most of the damage inflicted on the personnel of Umbrella, is by a computer called "The Red Queen" which unleashes a set of death traps, to anyone infected with the "T virus". Practically the only part of the game that the movie stays true to is in fact that Umbrella has created a virus called the "T virus" which it plans to use for germ warfare. However, that's how close you'll come to similiarities once again between the game and the movie. Eventually Ms. Prospero is rescued, (technically she is put in the custody) of a group of special police cops , to infiltrate Umbrella and find out what the hell is going on. Adding more confusion (and laughter) to the situation is that Ms. Prospero has amnesia and doesn't  understand her connection to Umbrella.  Well it's revealed that Ms. Prospero was working with someone in Umbrella, to expose to the media the virus  that Umbrella was creating. However, that person died, along with the evidence that Umbrella is responsible for the chaos in Racoon City and Umbrella. Eventually these bumbling cops eventually meet a holographic image of the Red Queen who says "I've been a very bad girl". LOL. Yeah and I would have added "I've been a bad actress to be in this film too". Eventually the remaining cops become aware of the zombies and other monsters and try to escape from Umbrella headquarters.... Besides the terrible acting, script and story in Resident Evil, there is also a lack of creatures from the games. The zombies , zombie dogs, and lickers are in R.E. but here is a whole of creatures and monsters not in the movie: Giant, poisonous spiders,  killer sharks, 2 arm ferocious hunters, large killer poisonous plants and the over 6ft tall indestructible Tyrants in the game. A waste of a golden opportunity to make a good movie.
0 ||| Awful movie.  Incoherent.
0 ||| Oh Mila......if only you could act, even just a little.....what a waste of time watching this crap.  And Dustin Hoffman......you are now dead to me, Sir.
0 ||| I was looking forward to getting the chance to watch this movie, after the success of the Resident Evil Video game. But unfortunately, this movie is nothing like the game. The characters aren't the same, and the actual story is different. Sure, it is good to have a different story, you don't want to copy everything from the game, but i think the overall idea of the movie, should be based around the game, because thats what everyone is familiar with. But no, it is completely different, and thats its biggest downfall.  The characters of the movie aren't properly introduced. There is no background to them, so you don't care if they live or die. It seems that they were more focussed on getting to the gore instead of building up the movie.  The zombies were my biggest problem. They didn't look scary at all. Half of them didn't even look dead. Looked more human then some of the people i see around in the streets these days.   Overall a missed opportunity. I give the movie 1 star because Milla Jovovich has a nice body :P
1 ||| Resident Evil is sort of an unbalanced mixture of old-school zombie horror and new-school filmmaking and special effects. Everything about the movie has to be a lot faster (except the zombies themselves, somewhat surprisingly), there has to be martial arts complete with even some wire-fu, and it has slimy monsters that are rendered by CGI, not old-fashioned animatronics. As you can see, I was never particularly won over by the film. Resident Evil opens in an underground laboratory called "The Hive, a top-secret facility owned by a company called the Umbrella Corporation, situated underneath Raccoon City. One of the lab workers sabotages the place, shutting the power down and unleashing a deadly virus that kills its victims and brings them back as zombies. We then cut to a cutie naked chick (Milla Jovovich) called Alice, who awakens in a bathtub inside some large mansion; not only is she unclothed, she's also suffering from a mild form of amnesia. Before she can collect her bearings (though she has enough time to put on a dress), an elite military task force barges into the building, taking her and an outsider (Eric Mabius) to the underground facility, directly connected to the mansion. Their mission is to shut down the Red Queen, the computer controlling the lab, but they''ll have to get through flesh-eating zombies and maniacal defense systems to accomplish that. As directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, the same man who crafted the far superior and terrifically frightening Event Horizon, Resident Evil is unfortunately lacking in much of that film's thrills and chills. Anderson shows an inconsistent hand at staging and filming action sequences; the movie's numerous shootouts and fight scenes are only mildly exciting at best, hampered too often by close-up shots of big guns and expended shells. Worse yet, all the violence is sanitized; there's hardly any blood or gore in this picture. Actually, what's probably most memorable about the picture as a whole is how maddeningly inconsistent it is in terms of pacing and excitement. For every scene that's fun to watch, there's another that's just plot-stopping, whether it's watching the survivors move from one bland-looking corridor to another, or Milla Jovovich jump-kicking zombie dogs in slow motion, or a computer program tiresomely going over the very simple zombie rules. There are also some glaring technical faults that I'm surprised were't fixed or edited in post-production, such as an unbearably loud industrial score that blocks out most of the expository dialogue, most of it uttered by Colin Salmon, who if you're familiar with his work, already has a pretty quiet voice that'd be inaudible matched up against anyone else in the cast. The zombies in this movie are your basic "pale and rotting skin" undead, some with the occasional missing bits of face and flesh. Unfortunately, the zombies in this film have goofy-looking mechanical movements, as if though their joints were so stiff, they could barely show much in the way of mobility. Maybe it's the effects of rigor mortis, but this makes zombies far less enjoyable to observe. Most of the cast ranges from non-descript to just plain awful. Easily the worst of the bunch is Michelle Rodriguez, whose only distinct trait is a perpetual frown; she's given a lot of macho dialogue, but Jenette Goldstein she is not. Surprisingly, it's Jovovich who stands out as the film's kickass heorine. Sure, she's not much of an actress, but she's got the physical stuff down pat, for the most part. And she's cute enough that I don't mind seeing her in a slinky red dress, as well as a couple of scenes that briefly reveal some of her naughty bits. Because there's hardly any gore, Resident Evil doesn't really work all that well as a zombie flick. And because it's not scary, horror is out of the question, too. But being a zombie fan, I'm prone to forgiving movies of this ilk simply because I'm pretty easy to please. Resident Evil is a passable enough timewaster, worth a rental, but it's certainly nothing I'll ever give much thought to again. Compared to the recent spate of zombie horror, Resident Evil might very well be the most lackluster of the bunch. It's never as intriguing or intelligent as 28 Days Later or as marvelously thrilling as the Dawn of the Dead remake and it's never as hilariously enjoyable as the misguided House of the Dead, proving that mediocrity really can be less entertaining than plain awfulness. ** 1/2 out of *****
0 ||| Where to start, where to start. I know... the game. Resi Evil the game was, and still is, one of the greats. It had everything you could've hoped for. Zombies, action, scaryness, and a conspiracy/mystery. The sequels continued the story, and once again great. They where like movies themselves. Now, lets look at the movie on its own before we compare it to the original game (resident Evil 1 - psone). The casting of Milla Jovovich, although she can't act, wasn't bad. It was the others who where terrible. Michelle Rodriguez... OH MY GOD, when she tried to act tough, i squirmed. The Story... oh yeah, there is no story. The zombies... people with a bit of grey make up and contacts (although the dogs where good). Action... Yawn. Scary level 1-10 (10 highest) -4. Sory to sound sarcastic, but it stunk. Now the comparison. With the game, you had a great story with real suprising twists. You had real terror, and great music to go with it. Even the characters where top (although the voice acting is the only bad point on this game). It was gritty, it never had mad sci fi gizmos... it was a true horror game with true horror survival game play and could've been easily converted in to a film. But no, Paul Anderson (One of the worst directors ever) some how gets the job to turn this great game in to a film. Instead of keeping to the story, he throws out all the work done by the guys at Capcom and uses the name to tell his own so-called story. he throws out the characters of resi evil and brings his own in. Who ever says this is a kick ass movie deserves to have there ass's kicked. I've heard this be called a prequel. If its a prequel, where's Albert Wesker. Bye this film at your own preil. Regarding the sequel, Apocalypse, i've seen stills of Milla and the new character, Jill Valentine (thats right) and four words come to mind, looks cheap and tacky. Don't let the trailer fool you. Kick ass film... yeah right... idiots. If the review sounds rough, sorry. Very angry man. Paul Anderson has destroyed any chance of a proper Game Adaptation with Resi Evil, With Chris Redfield the main guy, and Albert Wesker the arch nemeisis and the betrayer. I Hope the studios see sense and don't make a 3rd resi film, and leave it a few years for a proper director to come in and revive the franchise in the proper way.
0 ||| I really don't like writing negative reviews.  I like to write about things I enjoy, it makes the process of writing reviews much more enjoyable.  But every now and again something so rotten comes along that I've gotta say something.  This is the case with Resident Evil.  Hollywood seems to be getting into a zombie phase these days.  This is scary coz Hollywood knows about as much about making a good zombie flick as I know about nuclear fusion.  History has shown us that all great zombie flicks have been made outside the system.  There are many reasons I hate this film, but here's the top two:  1) I'm a fan of George Romero, and 2) I'm a fan of the video game series.  Resident Evil is a game based on the works of George Romero, yet Romero wasn't allowed to do this film.  Just like a previous reviewer, I have also read some of Romero's original script for Resident Evil.  If he made it, it would have been superb.  Why wasn't it chosen?  Probably coz it was intelligent, it actually stuck very close to the story, it would have been about two hours long, and it would have been too gory for an R rating.  In other words-for people who like good horror films and not cruddy rock video type films.  Instead the studios figured that they'd go with Paul Anderson since he directed another lame movie version of a video game.  This film actually has a decent opening sequence, but falls flat on it's face afterwards.  Anderson decided to take it upon himself to change the story, and not for the better either.  Now everthing is all high tech and computerized.  Part of the scariness of the game was it's simplicity.  It's down and dirty approach to survival.  We have yet another clone of 2001's HAL in the form of a computer security system called the Red Queen(oooooh, scary).  Everything's a cliche in this film, no surprises.  The soundtrack is dated and annoying.  It's full of that lame Matrix slo-mo junk we've seen a million times before, as well as those lame VanDamme-esque slo-mo kicks and punches.  The "Licker" is pitiful.  I've seen scarier creatures in Fraggle Rock.  The cast is all pretty people, not real looking people.  All of the scientists in the beginning are hot women!  Yeah, right.  There's a scene stolen from the movie, "Cube".  There's basically no gore.  Sorry to sound so shallow, but the sad fact is that gore is required for a zombie film.  The only positive I can think of is the zombie dogs which looked good.  But that's the only good I could find out of an hour and forty minutes.  I feel so sorry for Romero.  He's really been getting the green weenie lately.  First, he's screwed out of Resident Evil, then some no-talent hack by the name of Zack Snyder remakes Dawn Of The Dead!  And this is Romero's genre!  He made this genre, now they're treating him like a doormat.  Accept no imitations and make it a Romero night!
1 ||| If you are unfamiliar with the incredible Resident Evil video games, watching this movie won't make you want to try them out.  And if you're a fan them, like myself, you're going to be set up for extreme disappointment. First of all, there's not much here in common with the games, other than zombies and an occasional mention of the T-virus or some other phrase from the games.  Secondly, there is nothing frightening about this movie.  Unlike the games, all the instances of violence/gore/shock come across as very campy rather than scary.  Actually, "campy" may be the wrong word to use, as that would imply a bit of lightheartedness- this movie takes itself *way* too seriously. You feel very little tension or buildup while watching, and you'll find yourself looking at the packaging halfway through to find out what the running time is.  It's just plain boring.  And of course, there's a setup for a sequel no one is asking them to make. The only impressive thing about this film is the performance of lead actress Milla Jovovich, who seems to be the only involved in the movie who realizes this is based on a VIDEO GAME, not Shakespeare.  She did a great job considering the quality of the movie.  On the other hand, Michelle Rodriguez gives an eye-rollingly melodramatic performance as the token "tough chick."  The other actors either just stand around, get killed, or most likely, both. But who knows, maybe the upcoming sequel will be better.  But not likely.
0 ||| This director really has only one good movie - "Event Horizon" - and everything else is just plain bad, Resident Evil being absolutely no exception to this general rule of thumb and God help "Aliens Vs Predator" with the way things are shaping up. This film is marginally better than Ghosts of Mars, but only because Milla Jovovich goes around the place in a really very short mini-skirt and just happens to get skin sticking wet clothes towards the end of the picture. Overall the movie has extremely low production values and even lower prospects in the execution of the film. All of the sets looked contrived, i.e - they have no point being there other than to match scenes in the computer game or look interesting. Oh, yeah did we mention that this is based on a computer game? No, okay lets back up a bit here... Resident Evil just happens to be a really popular 3rd person zombie shoot 'em up horror survival game that they are now selling as a movie. Okay, let's move on... When the actors in this film are more robotic than the characters in the game then you know something has gone seriously wrong... and it has. Nobody in the cast is mildly recognizable except for Milla Jovovich, and they shouldn't be either, because they all suck real bad. The camera work is some of the worse seen in a long time. Why? Because it attracts attention itself almost all of time. Bad cinematography. For 35mm it looks like it was shot on video. The lighting is pretty good whenever it turns on or off but when it is static it is just useless. The editing is extremely bad at times and cuts fail to match. From an atheistic standpoint its all terrible production values for a Hollywood budget. The CGI also happens to be extremely, EXTREMELY, dodgy most of the times. You know when the animation looks like animation? Well x 100 times worse is what you get here. It looks terribly fake, and even the dogs covered in RED PAINT look very cheesy. Overall this is a really really really very bad production. The story is worse and even some of the....... Bah. Forget about me writing anymore. Not worth it. Just go play the game instead.
0 ||| BEFORE THIS MOVIE CAME OUT I HAD HIGHLY ANTICIPATED TO BE A GREAT MOVIE, BUT IT SUCKED SO BAD AND IT WAS STUPID THE GRAPHICS WERE HORRIBLE IVE SEEN SCARY MOVIES FROM THE 70'S THAT HAS BETTER SPECIAL EFFECTS THAN THIS CRAP. A LITTLE ADVICE TO ANYONE WHOS THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS MOVIE DONT!!!!!! NOT EVEN RENT IT, ITS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY.
1 ||| Terrible movie, full of anachronisms; particularly in the dialogue.  While the sets were OK, the writing and acting was just plain bad.  I was expecting more, as John Malchevish and Dustin Hoffman were billed.  Mr. Hoffmans perfomance was really the only redeeming value to the film;  It just wasn't worth the time investment to see it.
0 ||| OK!......PERsanly i didn't like the re movie that much....BUT!.....im gonna watch the second one!....especially how nemisis is gonna be in it....and jill.  And Im gettin all excited about it......to bad its not september yet. (sigh)..STTAAAAARRRSS.
1 ||| ...on it's own, standard Hollywood fare. Don't go into this expecting a faithful take of the original "Resident Evil" game; that storyline was tossed out the window, with director Paul Anderson inserting his own cookie-cutter vision (lack of vision?), looking to cash in on the franchise name. Anderson, in the liner notes, is called a "fan" of the RE video game series. Coulda fooled me, since his big-screen adaptation hardly has anything to do with RE. For whatever reason (ego? studio execs with zero inspiration beyond $$$?), Anderson decided to script his own "prequel" to the events of the first RE game. The game was a slow-paced creepfest, all about atmosphere. This film is typical Hollywood tripe, full of kung-fu babes, lame one-liners, wooden acting, obnoxiously-loud industrial metal music, and cheap "things popping out of lockers" scares. The basic plotline: Umbrella, a sinister mega-corporation which profits from bio-engineering & genetic alteration aimed towards warfare while operating under the guise of a General-Electric type company, has a massive underground lab. Nine-to-fivers work there like they would in an ordinary office, live there, eat & shop there, shut away from the world above. This is all hidden under a pristine mansion. Some criminal jerk decides to steal a very lethal viral agent known as the T-Virus, intentionally loosing the virus in the process, causing all hell to break loose. Everybody down below dies, re-animate as zombies. A "crack" SWAT team swoops in to find an amnesiac agent and a do-gooder trying to bring down Umbrella. Zombies attack, and most of the squad dies in a laser room before most of the action goes down. Later, mutant dogs abd beasts attack, Milla does her "Matrix" routine....you get the point. Anderson turned a great game series into a convoluted mess. There is no "Red Queen" killer computer in the game. No underground office workers. No Alice the Zombie Killer. The script is paper-thin. Here's a great example; Team Leader: "Report, soldier." Jovovich as Alice: "What?". Good stuff, eh? Michelle Rodriguez will make you wonder how she gets paid to act, irritating you beynd belief in the process. She plays a Vazquez-from-Aliens ripoff character, snarling the entire movie in an effort to play a tough commando chick. The rest? Uh, doesn't matter since you barely even learn any of their names. Bad zombie effects, mediocre CGI work (including some zombies), blasting music....meant as a distraction, I believe, from the awful screenplay. There's no crumbling Spencer Mansion. No odd puzzles to solve. No lone zombie wandering a dark hallway. No mouldering tombs to search. No blackened catacombs. No Trevor family. No freak mutations like the massive snake Yawn, Plant 42, Lisa Trevor, the shark Momma Neptune, or the dreaded Tyrant. No moody atmosphere of being stranded in a remote mansion, looking for your missing comrades without a clue as to what happened. No horror of discovering sinister experiments. In fact, there's nothing in this movie that made the game so creepy and effective. It was all there; perfect source material to make a truly frightening film. Sadly, it was all trashed in favor of pretty actors and lame Matrix-like action. In other words, Hollywood took another promising franchise and turned it into the typical garbage that they churn out day after day. On it's own, the film is your average Hollywood action/horror job, indistinguishable from the rest of its ilk. As a RE film, it is a complete bomb & miserable failure. Want a great RE movie experience? Buy a GameCube and the Resident Evil remake. The graphics are amazing, and the mood is perfect. Play it in the dark and you start looking over your shoulder. Want a bad RE movie experience? Pop this film into your DVD player and you start looking over your shoulder for the nearest exit. Shame on you, Paul W.S. Anderson. What does the W.S. stand for? Writes Sh*t? Next time, stick to the storyline and spare us your own embarrassing version of things.
0 ||| This version of Joan of Arc was a complete and utter disgrace. The apparent point of this movie is to depict Joan as completely insane and no real saint.  So insane, in fact, that this character of Joan was completely unable to have a normal conversation with anyone.  None of the other characters in the film have even a smidgen of respect for her.  The closest thing to respect would be amusement to the fruits of insanity to have one's way.  One goes away with the feeling that not a single worthwhile human value was in place.  A story of a traumatized and visibly very insane woman inducted by the elite of the time as a useful fool and then completely discarded in her time of need after literally saving France and restoring the crown.  To add insult to injury, Jesus was depicted as demonic and hideous with bulging eyes, looking like he was in drag, covered in blood, and frightful. A brutal murder-rape was "added" to the story to make it known that Joan was not speaking to saints or doing God's work but a severely traumatized, very immediately visibly mentally ill person who ultimately chose her own death to appease her delusions.  One must wonder what kind of corruption is behind this completely soiled and devaluing version of the story of Joan of Arc and this disgraceful depiction of Jesus.
1 ||| Over-acting, silly dialog,  and drawn-out camera tricks to convey Joan's "visions"  make this a tedious and boring adaptation of an otherwise interesting historical tale.  The camera tricks are something out of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Blair Witch Project</a>&nbsp;or the old&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Batman/dp/B000N54NGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Batman</a>&nbsp;television series and not something one would expect from a movie with a real budget.  It is apparent that historical accuracy was a low priority compared to vain attempts to make the story more dramatic through the overemphasized breathy monologues and tilted camera sequences.  This is particularly sad in light of the fact that the history behind the story is truly interesting in itself and the Hollywood tricks rob the viewer of any interest in the story at all.  The one good thing about this movie is it will make you want to go back to reading instead.

0 ||| Is that you should avoid this film as if it was crawling with Ebola.  It's utter nonsense, with hardly a cranial cavity on its' shoulders, much less a brain.  The acting is so wooden I have half a mind to use it to make furniture.  The plot doesn't make a lick of sense (something about a wicked corporation that runs the world and makes a new, deadly man-made virus, for no apparent reason), and the action sequences are utter trash, with no sense of urgency for the characters, because we don't care about them anyway.  "Resident Evil" is crap on celluloid.  Avoid as such.
0 ||| I was reluctant to watch resident evil, considering it was based on a video game. Well, my fears were realized in this hack-n'-slash skin fest. First the good: the first fifteen minutes were excellent. Great tension, great screenplay, excellent action. (Especially the scene where they are trapped in the elevator). The movie went down hill from there, into some campy zombie-killing thriller featuring an impractically clad heroine, and dozens of super-model looking commandos. sorry, I had to pass on finishing this, about the time the woman woke up in the mansion, my brain began to go numb. Perhaps the sequel will be better? But then again, considering the success of past video-game based films, perhaps not...
1 ||| it doesnt do good with its wooden dialogue and its crappy acting. basically some moments are way better then others but the blending with zombies and heavy rock isn't great. the suspenseful piano music in the game is better and the games themselves are way better. Anderson directed a ok but boring movie to a great and horrific video game. a dissapointment really
0 ||| I don't know about the video game but I don't have to know about it and to be a bright one to see that the conceptors of the game were inspired by George Romero's cinema. Take Romero's excellent movie, "Day of the Dead" (the third and last film in his zombi trilogy), add to it a big budget, plenty of computers and special effects and a couple of female stars, in order to grab the required audience, and you get that kind of predigested movie, that you forget as soon as you see it. The story is practically the same: a handful of characters trapped by a bunch of zombies in a closed, underground place, and who quickly slander each other for survival. "Resident Evil" is unfortunately typical of today's American action cinema: it's empty, noisy and brainless, in one word, standard. More than the story, totally trivial today - the virus theme has been told a hundred times, and in better, especially in "Twelve Monkeys" and in Richard Matheson's founder novel, "I am Legend" -, the biggest default of this film is the total lack of gore scenes, which is paradoxical for a zombie movie and the symptom of a politically correct U.S. cinema. Milla Jovovich is not very comfortable, the music, uselessly hard, is deafening and brings bad headache (but this is the fashion today), the beginning is totally taken from Vincenzo Natali's "Cube" and the ending, from John Carpenter's "In the Mouth of Madness". This disastrous movie (but what could you expect from the director of pitiful "Mortal Kombat", also based upon a video game?) is a good proof that money and technology don't always do good to cinema. A last point: it's George Romero himself who was first supposed to direct the movie. But he was put away after he brought a script we may suppose as 'gore' - and good - as his previous zombi works... Shame on the deciders! And shame on the finally chosen director! Your movie is a waste!
0 ||| With certainty, others may have more egregious nominees than this one; however, this is perhaps my least favorite film ever.  Which is not to say it is the least historically accurate, but it would win my vote for that distinction as well.  Jeanne d'Arc is my patron, and I watched the film in the hopes that it would provide insights that cannot be depicted in words alone.  What we do know of her is that at the very least she was humble, not only in origin but in practice.  She also only spoke when pressed to do so.  Having met understated practitioners of humility, none of them scream like a lunatic, which is exactly what Jeanne does in the movie for the entirety.  The thought that a raving lunatic would sway nobility from a local baron to the dauphin that would become Charles VII is laughable.  I really cannot provide further detail because every scene entices such cringing from the woeful depiction that I consider having watched it an act of self mortification on my part.  If you want a less distasteful, less distracting, less painful depiction of Jeanne d'Arc, look elsewhere.
0 ||| Full of inaccuracies and anachronisms, "Joan" looks like she has been doing aerobics for years and has a Hollywood stylist as well.  Avoid!
1 ||| "Resident Evil" was, originally a series of really enjoyable video games. With a dark, creepy atmosphere that could make you jump out of your seat, it created a world in which you could easily go into. It also had the reputation of being a very graphic and gory game. Another great element of the games was the plot; you had to resolve many puzzles, and your intelligence was required to play. The same things are not all true in "Resident Evil", the film. "Resident Evil" tells the story of a woman who had been rescued from a virus infested research center. She awakens later on, she has forgotten everything. After that, a military team takes her and brings her back in the research facility, when the effects of the virus are no longer contagious. They find that the release of the deadly virus was a conspiracy. But there are many problems on their way; some almost invincible zombies, a main system (which takes the aspect of a little girl) that wants to kill every intruder, and a security system that turns against them. In the case of "Resident Evil", it's not the movie itself that is so bad, it's all those little things that are messed up, without ruining completely the quality of the movie. If you've seen "Deep Blue Sea" and liked it, then you'll love Resident Evil. As much as "Deep Blue Sea" was a very simple and common model of what a suspense movie turns out to be in Hollywood, "Resident Evil" is another clone of that model. What I mean by that is the presence of the similar elements, which mostly are: A good-looking girl, a bunch of men that get killed one by one, a spectacular enemy, some high-tech facilities and equipment, a very simple scenario, some violence (not graphic enough to gross out the average teenager, which is 80% of their target audience, but not mild enough to be rated PG-13), and some cool looking action sequences. It's a formula that works many times, and they chose it for a movie that promised so much, but did not deliver what the real "Resident Evil" fans like. A movie that could have been so much more...I could easily criticize the plot, or the actors, but you know how it is, and we all know how it is. It's just normal, common, average...it has nothing special...it is an excuse to make a movie. I'll still have to admit that Milla Jovovich is not only a beautiful woman, but she's also a pretty good actress. Even though her role in "Resident Evil" did not require a lot of talent, she's still able, sometimes, to make us share the shivers she plays on the screen. The points where I would focus a little more are two very important elements in the "Resident Evil" video games. Like I said before, originally, these games were moody and gory. Two major deceptions here. The gore...ARGH! I just can't take it, it's made by computer! This is a message to all directors: If you want to put any gore in your films, do it the old fashioned way. Digital blood looks fake, digital monsters look fake...Even with some very cheap gore/creature effects, you can do a better job than the one they did in "Resident Evil"...the same thing is true in Blade...Every single mutilation in "Resident Evil" was made in CGI, and every single one of them really looks bad. (Spoilers) There's a part where more than half a dozen soldiers are cut in pieces by lasers (and it really deceived me to see that three quarters of the human characters die in two minutes...human characters were the only hope of seeing a gore scene in this film, because the zombies in this film have coagulated blood, which is, for sure, realistic and intelligent, but absolutely not satisfying for the gore fans) and some heads are cut off, some bodies are cut in cubes. But every darn death looks so fake! Even in the excellent low-budget Canadian movie "Cube", the effect with the guy that gets sliced into dices is really, really, really, really, a thousand times better than all of "Resident Evil"'s reunited gore moments. I'm sick of CGI gore...and all CGI made movies...this is removing all the human aspects of movies...people are amazed to see things that were made with computers and almost look real...Yeah, they almost look real, but if they were done like before, they would look even more real! Well, what is the point of being impressed with things that could be a lot more simple and look better if they were done like before...It's not because technology exists that films should overuse it...Technology is a tool, and many film makers don't understand it. The other aspect, the mood, is not delivered the same way...it's more like a futuristic atmosphere, with a certain lack of terror, a very "Blockbuster" atmosphere, with nothing really eerie. The music is not bad, but it certainly is not as creepy as the one in the games. The zombies are not scary at all, and the other "creatures" are plain laughable. They kept some elements from the games, and that's a good thing. The city is still "Raccoon City", the train really is identical to the one in the game of "Resident Evil 2", (Spoilers) the city in the end really seems to be an image taken from the game, it's the Umbrella Corporation, etc. But, talking about that ending, which is actually pretty good, I would have seen the whole movie setting in the Raccoon City streets, like we do in the beginning of "Resident Evil 2" (the game). Overall, I'd say that "Resident Evil" really is a disappointment, especially if you were a big fan of the games, but for those who haven't heard of the games and saw the movie and thought it was good, you should definitely check these games out! "Resident Evil", the movie, is a very common piece of entertainment, that, without being bad, simply offers some acceptable entertainment, some mild thrills, and an easy and agreeable night at the theater. It really is nothing impressive, but it's very ordinary recipe of Hollywood thriller that puts itself under a name that has acquired reputation with the years. Not that bad, but nothing great either.
0 ||| For the easily pleased, simple-minded, less discriminating viewers only. John Malkovich and Dustin Hoffman couldn't even save this one. I even think their characters dragged this story down, but there was so little hope and promise from the moment this movie was conceived. Mila what's her name was so thoroughly annoying and unconvincing throughout this mess I just wanted to fast forward to the end to see her burn. At least it has a happy ending. The best thing I can say about this movie is it took pathetic and lame to new heights.
0 ||| The Messenger: The Story of Joan Of Arc :  I was browsing through my netflix and see this movie and saw 2 stars-2 1/2 stars when I said you know I should give it a try, Dustin Hoffman is in it and it's about Joan Of Arc,I am Catholic and I like movies like that. So I see the movie and it is looking good except the graphic parts and half-way It starts to sink that what the director Luc Besson intended is his biased view of events. I then google and it confirmed my suspicions, In LEFTIST Rag "Le Monde" He is as quoted as saying Joan Of Arc Should have followed the commandments if she is a true Christian ,Thou Shalt Not Kill"and quote. Although he fails to realize it's Thou Shalt not Commit Murder. In fact there is such a thing as a Just War and Self Defense is covered as well. Murder is a different story,So you get another Liberal Trying to rewrite history and make Joan Of Arc look crazy. The French Adore Joan Of Arc and for Good Reason,she wasn't crazy. As for the Acting, I thought John Malkovich was great, and The Battle Scenes are good even if they are not ACCURATE by a longshot,and certainly you see why The English and French hate each other(The English Protestant wackjobs who would later rather Follow Henry and his Hideous Girl and Become Anglican-a Mutated Form of Catholicism),this movie is entertainment not historical,I will look elsewhere for A Joan Of Arc movie perhaps it will not be such a Special Effects Bonaza but I want to see a less biased movie.
0 ||| I had to stop after 15 min when the gum chewing mediaeval girls started saying "YO! DUDE! FER SHURE~! DIG IT! being somewhat facetious but thats how it was
1 ||| As a movie, certainly entertaining, but don't look for anything historical here since it must have been a Joan from an alternate universe being depicted.  For example, in this movie Joan has deep angst about her sword she may have found in a field.  While in fact this Sword:  "- --In place of the sword offered to her she described in detail the location and appearance of a sword in the Chapel of St Catherine de Fierbois.  It was found deeply buried exactly where she had described and the blade was so covered in rust it would have been impossible for her to describe it without having seen it before.  The rust readily fell off when the blade was wiped. -- "  Perhaps this film is a conspiracy of the irreverent, irreligious and atheistic working  to "deconstruct" Joan; to convince a modern, uninformed audience she was a raving schizoid lunatic leading the superstitiously ignorant to lucky victory; with a flaming end.  Or not.  Aside from that, I found it entirely entertaining filled with arrow sticking battle scenes and screaming mayhem.  Once I brainwashed myself into believing that actress Milla Jovovich was portraying a personality from the bizzaro world instead of a real-life historically significant figure, I actually enjoyed the film.  I give it 5 stars minus 3: 1 For Milla Jovovich 1 For the incredible exciting siege sequence -1 for being magnificently historically inaccurate -1 For conning me to believe this was a movie about Joan of Arc -1 For being so unfaithful  to her hard to believe true story making up stuff when it's so easy to Google it out the Real Deal otherwise (hmm, insult my intelligence comes to mind...)  Buy it for the two stars though, the siege IS really good...
0 ||| I agree with most reviews of "The Messenger: the Story of Joan of Arc." While Mila Jovich, or however you spell her last name, is an AWESOME actress, (she was in "Return to the Blue Lagoon" and all three "Resident Evil" movies) I'm sure that this portrayal of Joan is very inaccurate. In this movie she is portrayed as a screaming, annoying and lunatic b****!! What the hell was the director thinking? He or she clearly did NOT do thier homework. I have seen the 1999 miniseries of "Joan of Arc" starring the beuatiful young Hollywood actress Leele Sobieski, (Deep Impact, The Glass House.) Sobieski portrays Joan as an innocent but brave nineteen-year-old who fought for the freedom of France, and who sought to have the French King crowned. Although some argue that the miniseries is not entierly accurate, (but than again what movie now-a-days is?) still the "Joan of Arc" film depicts the herione the way the world remembers her. The miniseries is truely powerful, gripping and dramatic. It's sad that the big budget version of Joan in "The Messenger" is so twisted beyond any historical accuracy. In this film you don't even get the impression that Joan really was holy to the point of hearing the voices of saints calling out to her; rather Joan is simply crazy and dillusional beyond anyone's comprehension. It seems as if the director and producers intentionally portrayed Joan as a mad woman with a disperate need for making herself known to the world. But yet, as the director of the miniseries "Joan of Arc" stated during his research, even in books and in that movie Joan was portrayed as a sweet, loving and giving character who's strong faith in God led her to her ultimate demise; for SHE choose to go into the flame, rather than she was forced to burn at the stake. And I believe that "Joan of Arc" is as accurate as any film could possibly get about the "the flower of France."
0 ||| As a St. Jeanne d'Arc devotee, I have read quite a bit on my favorite Saint, as well as seen my share of movies.  Some were well done, none have been definitive, and others are, well, like this one.  I usually try to be a bit more intelligent, but the first word that comes to mind when I think of this particular version is CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Historically innacurate, spiritually unfaithful, this film stinks.  It is downright heretical, portraying our beloved Jeanne as having made a pact with the devil.  She is shown as a proud, haughty girl at odds with her Church.  What a bunch of bull.  The ONLY two bits of this film I appreciated were the attention given to her ring (given her by her brother), as well as the scene when she brings a child back to life (I am unaware of any other films on her that portray this true story).  Other than these, it took a lot not to walk out of the theatre when I went to see it.  In other words, BLAHHHHHHHH!  Don't waste your time, money, or soul on such non-sense.
0 ||| This review may sound pretentious and ignorant, but in truth I'm a big fan of British history, so bear with me!  Even as a film itself, it's surreal, and I don't like the acting. But as with any historical film that includes the British, they're made out to be the absolute bad guys! Sure we were forging an empire within France (i.e. The Hundred Years War), but rapists and murdering pillagers!? Never!  Historically accurate, full of British sentiment, and down-right weird. Avoid this film today, folks!
0 ||| I guess you might have to be a fan of the game in order to enjoy the movie.  But I doubt that even if that were true that one could derive any enjoyment out of this piece of trash.  There is one moment of pleasure, for all you gore fans, but that is the extent.  I hated almost every moment of it.  It is not that the story so much is awful, it is the execution.  And, the acting is not all that good either.  Don't waste your time on this one.
1 ||| i ran into blockbuster excited to watch this movie. i am a big fan of joan and i like many others had big expectations for the movie. this movie was done the wrong way in many ways possible. who made the idea to have "joan of arc" the savior of the republic of france, to make her into a total lunatic? i know she had a minor case of epilepsy but she's not no EMILY ROSE. (in case you don't know emily rose she was a girl who was a epileptic that was so intence she was supposely possessed by demons.) how can u do such a thing? they made joan so annoying i didn't want to watch it no more. the action was not good at all. u could tell some of the cast of the movie were atheists because they made it look like those signs were not real. those signs were left by GOD and they were not by coincedence. don't bother pick it up and if you do, i doubt u will watch it again. this is the miami reviewer. PEACE.
0 ||| This movie was bad. I watched it because I've always loved the stories about Joan. This movie was sloppy and poorly done in everyway. I thought the rape scene was terrible and I couldn't get that 'scene' out of my head because it was fused to my brain while I was watching the rest of the flick. Of course it didn't help much because later they repeated the scene...WHY?? Then they made the character Joan a complete nut case that she couldn't make a decision without going ballistic. This is a complete nil for me.
0 ||| This movie SOOOOOOO sucks! I won't even waste my oxygen going into all the reasons why it does! Just know this... I have a personal collection of currently 538 horror films.... And I've prolly seen close to a thousand! I own most the Resident Evil games, and love those, although the series is getting moldy. Obviously I pick up just about anything within the horror genre... I will never claim ownership to this dreadfull title! Also know that considering that it boasts itself as being the movie based a videogame series that features flesh eating zombies... There is not one on screen munching of any kind! Anyone who says otherwise is full of it! If your that confused with all the horror afficandos and Resident Evil fanboy adolescents having such differing reviews. Spend the few paltry dollars and rent it first! Buying this one without seeing it, is definitely risking ownership of a very expensive coaster!
0 ||| (...) The story of Joan of Arc (or Jeanne d'Arc as they call her in France) is well known just about everywhere. Joan is a poor peasant living in a small village in France during the Hundred Years War with England. She begins seeing heavenly visions that tell her she is God's messenger to rid her country of the bloody English. Somehow she convinces Charles, the Dauphin with visions of being king, to give her an army to storm Orleans. Using unconventional methods she leads her army to victory. The Dauphin is crowned king and mostly forgets about Joan. She leads an unsuccessful siege on Paris is given over to the English, tried and burned at the stake, several hundred years later she is sainted by the Catholic church. The Messenger covers most of this relatively faithfully, and beautifully.  Luc Besson is a talented director filming such classics as Le Femme Nikita and The Professional. His talent is presented here in his ability to create interesting and beautiful shots, but is lost in creating a cohesive story. He doesn't seem to know what to do with the story about the young saint. In parts it seems earnest in it's recreation of this revolutionary with heavenly visions, but then it sinks into near parody of itself and in the ends sinks towards a reinventing of the events themselves asking Joan herself whether or not her visions were real or mere psychosis.  Milla Jovovich is a pretty face who has mostly been in forgettable, silly comedies and the Resident Evil franchise which might as well be considered a silly comedy for all its worth. Here, she has two modes of acting, a strange amphetamine delivery of her lines as if she couldn't spit them out fast enough, or a snarled scream as if acting was merely being the loudest person on the set. It is not a nuanced performance. For the entirety of the film she seems completely out of place.  The battle or Orleans is tame at best. There are virtually no scenes of real ambitious spectacle. We are given nothing to inform us of her revolutionary forms of combat. Instead her method seems to be screaming a lot and jumping a horse over the enemies fence. Later the storming of Paris is so humorous it is sad. Joan screams and screams that she needs back up while a few soldiers randomly knock on what must be the Paris gates. These soldiers are so bewildered a pathetic looking they seem more out of a Monty Python sketch than a serious film about war.  Beyond the visual elements the only saving grace is Dustin Hoffman's performance as the Grand Inquisitor or Conscience. It is a fine performance from a fine actor, but it is a peculiar character. He spends his time questioning Joan's own sanity. Could her visions in fact be some form of psychosis or fantasy? Could crucial moments in her life like finding a sword in a field in fact be simple coincidence? Good questions in the history of the real Joan of Arc, but they seem out of place here. Nowhere in the film are we led to believe Joan is nothing but the real thing. Why bring these questions into play during its climactic ending. The film would have worked much better believing whole heartedly in Joan's purpose and vision. Or questioning her visions from the beginning, a revisioning of the myth could be very interesting. Instead it kicks its legs out from under itself by bringing her into question so late in the film.  What we get in this portrayal of Joan of Arc is some pretty visuals and a find performance from Dustin Hoffman. Try renting one of Luc Besson's earlier films and pick up anything from Hoffman's hey day in the 70's, they will be worth your dollar and your time far more than anything thing to be found here.  (...)
1 ||| I decided to give this movie a try despite the many negative reviews.  Boy was I sorry!  This film is a travesty so save your time (and your money if you're thinking of buying).  Milla Jovovich simply doesn't have the acting ability to pull this role off, plain and simple.  She portrays Joan as a wild-eyed nut case and somehow it's hard to generate much sympathy for her in the end.  Add to that the ridiculous dialogue (somehow I can't see 13th century people using the 21st century expression "whatever!") and you have a mess of a movie.  The sets and costumes are fairly good and the battle scenes reasonably realistic but that's about all I can say for it.  Go elseware for the story of St. Joan!
1 ||| Besson's film on the legendary Joan of Arc leaves mixed results. Although he presented an original angle in showing her to be less than heavenly inspired, Besson has seriously and uneffectively distorted several documented facts about Joan of Arc. This is rendered worse by a bad script and questionable acting.  All historical accounts suggest that Joan of Arc was soberly persistent in her pleas for the Dauphin to give her an army but she was never the delusional psychotic as shown in the movie. Her visions were inspired by the Saints and not by Christ Himself. All accounts are conclusive in that Joan of Arc was leading as a symbol of inspiration to the army and never once raised a weapon against the enemy: she never shed any blood. Finally, Joan of Arc never reneged her faith or retracted her statements about her divine mission: that's why she was put on the stake.  The film is unique in showing Joan of Arc more as the political puppet that she was in real life and how she became a liability after the crowning of the Dauphin in Orleans. The film also shows Joan as a person suffering from a dissociative disorder rather than being a divine messenger. John Malcovich and Faye Dunaway play their roles well as the Dauphin and the Regent Queen. Mila Jojovich is the worst performance in the film and, with her being the main character, the quality of the whole film is reduced to below average.  The battle and siege scenes are interesting but perhaps a little exaggerated.  The movie is perhaps worth renting once but this is certainly not the best rendition on this most intriguing of Christian saints/martyrs.
0 ||| What a waste of resources...This biopic is completely by-the-book, telling the story in an academic, uninspired, predictable way. The characters are all cardboard, and lead Milla Jovovich is over-the-top and not credible as Joan of Arc. This movie has no spark or life whatsoever, moving at a snail`s pace and failing to engage. The settings and costumes are decent, but that`s all there is to find here. Director Luc Besson also made the useless "The Fifth Element", and the style-over-substance perspective of that movie is present here, too. This is just a bunch of random fight sequences and melodramatic moments that go nowhere and generate a messy cinematic experience. A lackluster movie and one to avoid.
0 ||| Clearly the producers set out to make a mockery of Joan of Arc and they accomplished that goal rather well. While the costumes and the music are rather good, the script and the actors play their roles over-the-top and it makes for a silly sight. It seems that only revered Christians can be so badly depicted in Hollywood. I recommend a pass on this hate-mongering.
0 ||| This is quite possibly one of the worst films ever conceived.  Not just made, but conceived.  Milla Jovovich can't act her way out of a wet paper bag.  I thought The Fifth Element illustrated that.  The following people wasted their time and talent on this project: Dustin Hoffman, John Malcovich, Tchky Karyo, Faye Dunaway.  The insane in your face cinematography and the disturbing screaming and gestures of Jovovich's are just awful.  Why does Bravo: The Film and Arts Network include this in their 5-Star Cinema series?  It's fertilizer.
1 ||| Is the director French?  Is Joan not a French heroine?  If the answer is yes to both questions, then I have a hard time understanding why Besson makes her "confess" that all her great deeds were a mistake.  It doesn't bother me to interpret Joan of Arc as a lunatic - for all I know she may have been schizophrenic indeed!  (What else makes you hear voices?)  What I don't like is the notion that Joan herself lost faith in her own cause, questioned her own motives and regretted what she did, as apparently Besson makes her do at the end.  That's not my idea of a heroine or hero.
0 ||| Luc Besson has done some spectacular movies. This is not one of them. Milla's over-acting creates a character who is both annoying and difficult to believe. None of the central characters are easy to empathize with so one doesn't really care if they live or die. The violence seems unnecessary and gruesome. The script is choppy and the dialog is forced. Go watch The Professional instead.
1 ||| The first fifteen minutes of the film are mesmerizing as young Joan of Arc is explored with her leanings towards enjoying confession and how she got her calling. A fascinating openning. The only justification for the two stars I gave it. Then unfortuneately, Mila Jovanivich takes over as the grown up Joan of Arc.  A very unfortunate casting choice. She runs the gamut of acting emotions  ranging  from a to b.  She gawks in amazement and her eyes bulge with absolutely nothing underneath. She is unconvincing and annoying in this role. To add to this, her hair color changes from scene to scene. One scene she is blonde then she is brunette. Is this to distract us from her acting? Is this a God given hair color change? Or is it a vision from  Clairol?  Faye Dunaway and John Malkovich give good performances but they are not in enough of the movie to save it. By the time Dustin Hoffman shows up at the end, who even cares?  Aside from the great opening, the hole mishmash shows no insight into Joan of Arc.  After the fascinating opening--the ball is dropped and that is the director and lead actor's fault.  Lead a nation in battle? This woman can't lead a movie. Haven't seen other versions of the Joan of Arc Story but this definitely isn't the one to see.
0 ||| The woman in this movie was no saint. How can anybody who signs their faith over to save their own neck be a saint? And then she goes and admits that she did everything for her own revenge. Was God in this movie at all??? I doubt it. The devil was in it though and Joan surely goes straight to Hell after she is killed. I was expecting an uplifting movie about a woman of God. Instead I got a movie about some nut.
1 ||| THIS MOVIE WASNT WAHT I HAD THOUGHT. ITS ALL THE WRONG THING. U THINK THAT THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN AND SOMETHING ELSE HAPPEN. IF I WAS U THEN I WOULDNT GO AND SEE IT.
0 ||| Not only is Joan of Arc presented as a nut in this film, she's clearly tripping on speed: Jumping out of her skin, screaming her head off and delivering banal lines with halting, eye-bugging intensity. It's hard to believe that even the most religiously medieval French soldier would give this loon the time of day, let alone follow her into battle. Mon Dieu! Run awaaaaaayy. . . But I'll say this for the director, he's consistent. It's fast paced all the way through, what with boulders a la 'Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom ' getting hurled at the troops along with other JamesBondian gizmos making for cool technogore.  Which, alongside Joan's motivation in this script ( Her sister's been raped by the posse of --er I mean the Brits) turns it all into an enjoyable comic book Western revengefest. It's 'The Quick and the Dead' minus gunslingers, set in 1429. Plus the scenes of her schizoid 'visions' are gorgeously photographed. But as far as the real Joan of Arc, the only major historical figure whose life and thought has come down to us through sworn court testimony---Oh well, in the first place she's had writers of genius like Shaw and Twain to  balance this dramatization, and in the second place, as long as we're making films about protagonists who hear voices, wild battle scenes and trials for heresy it could have been much worse. How about: " Socrates, Herald of Hades! " (sigh)
1 ||| "The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc" is nothing more than a by-the-numbers film created with liberal use of "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Directing the Medeival Epic." I have been vastly entertained by director Luc Besson's work in the past, but this film is a plodding, gore-drenched nod toward Mel Gibson's vastly superior "Braveheart." "The Messenger" completely lacks all of the finer emotions that make an epic story compelling, despite the true nature of the people and some of the events. "The Messenger" also revels in its violence and grit, rather than trying to create something realistic (and more convincing). Milla Jovovich turns in an annoying performance as the shrieking saint, who does not inspire her troops so much as berate them in her holier-than-thou manner. The film's topics are interesting (was Joan really a saint who could speak to God, or was she just insane and driven by rage?), but the execution is poor. On top of this, the scripting and dialogue is just plain bad. If you want an epic, I suggest looking elsewhere. Maybe somebody out there will make a better picture about this fascinating historic figure.
0 ||| Derivative, boring, and beyond stupid, zombie flick "Resident Evil" misses every possible opportunity to scare, thrill, or even make sense. It doesn't even have the gorey guts of its video game inspiration. Your best bet? Skip this soulless claptrap and see how good movies weave complex plots, well-drawn characters, and true scares into a terrifying whole. "Aliens," "Dawn of the Dead." and "Blade 2" are an excellent start.
0 ||| The Resident Evil movie: yet another example of why Hollywood never seems to make a good game based movie. I would fall backwards in shock if I found out the film's director had actually PLAYED the games, or just had someone play them for him and explain what happens. Why does this movie throw any sort of continuity from the games out the window? Why are none of the characters from the game are here? The original Residant Evil had a perfect plot for a horror movie. The Special Tactics and Rescue Squad gets stuck in a mansion full of Zombies, Mutant Dogs, Frogs, Spiders, Bees, Sharks, you name it, they've got it, and an excellent character cast to go with it. Instead, they chuck it all out except for the mansion, the Zombies, the dogs, and the Licker from Resident Evil 2. And gore wise, it's pretty clean compared to the games. Heck, it probably wouldn't even be rated R if they didn't throw in Milla Jovovich's nude scenes to boost up the rating. *sigh*...
1 ||| It is definitely a Hollywood version. They have changed a lot the real history of Joan D'Arc. I don't think that Joan of Arc was angry all the time like they present her in the movie. Joan, according to the story heard voices from three saints, St. Catherine, St. Margaret and St. Michael. But in the movie they present three images and they never speak. Is like the same angel or saint in three different ages. The movie has more o less a slow pace and it turns really boring after 3/4 parts of the movie had elapsed. I think the version of Joan of Arc, starred by Lelee Sobieski is more loyal to what really happened than this one. Even the one in black & white with Ingrid Bergman was even better than this one.
1 ||| Having been somewhat fascinated by the life of Joan of Arc, and entertained by the French flair of Director Luc Besson's movies, it pains me to say that my disappointment in THE MESSENGER is most profound.  Truly, with such a promising opening scene and more than a couple of excellent actors at its disposal - not to mention a mythical and supernatural aura intertwined with an amazing history - one would expect, even at the very least, a little glimmer of brilliance. Yet, apparently, it never was meant to be.  However, I must say, the movie opens promisingly enough:  There's the pious child, Joan d'Arc, living her bright yet humble life in the 15th century French countryside. - She is portrayed at once as being extraordinarily blessed and preternaturally enlightened, by Heaven.  There's Music of Angels singing ecstatic praise, Visions of Divine Power moving nature around her, and Voices of "Him." (Be it Deity, Angel, Archangel, or perhaps her own Subconscious Soul?  I cannot tell...) - All so enticing and gravitating her toward Heavenly bliss. Yet it is within minutes of these glorious opening scenes that everything takes a very dark turn.  Suddenly, the child Joan sees the storm clouds culminate as the wolves and the English Army thunder in.  The sight of this is quite ominous -- not only for the child Joan, but for the entire course of the movie as well.  It's a shame - because, from here, THE MESSENGER actually could very well have become a movie of remarkable depth, voice and vision. Instead, the whole thing engulfs itself in blustering failures - its own annihilation ignited with the first sight of Milla Jovovich as Joan, the peasant girl, suddenly all grown up.  She makes her first appearance having somehow made her way to the castle of Chinon with a message to the Dauphin Charles VII, France's heir to the crown.  The movie offers no explanation as to how this unknown teenage girl had come to be known as the "Maid of Lorraine," nor of how she had made her way into the French Court. Apart from various transitional errors and a stunning lack of continuity, this picture further bears the awesome burden of poor casting and an even poorer script.  John Malkovich (Dauphin Charles VII) did a fine enough job of it - however, the script, relative to the role, was not compatible with his talents - and he was very blatantly miscast.  As for Milla Jovovich:  Well, I cannot say much about that folly, actually, without blasting away all credibility to her as an actress.  Truly, that's something I really do not wish to do.  Really, I must say in her defense that it seems she was obliged to make do with a script that made her sound like a borderline psychotic and rebellious adolescent somewhat of the present-day variety.  It's impossible to buy the possibility that anyone in the French Army would even consider following her lead. Sadly enough, the only reason I halfway speak in her defense is that she seemed to speak her lines as if she hated every single word of them - and her every look seemed to disdain the movie.  OK - Well, regardless, even for that, I guess I cannot in my heart of hearts give her any credit as an actress. Finally, I must give no insignificant amount of credit to Dustin Hoffman (the Voice), Faye Dunaway (Mother-In-Law to the Dauphin, Princess d'Aragon), and Timothy West (Pierre Cauchon - a prominent figure in Joan's final trial) for making the most of a flippant and shallow script. Finally, all the more I can say about this movie is that it could have been great, with only a bit more insight.  It's a shame that it fell the other way....
1 ||| The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (Luc Besson, 1999)  As the final credits rolled, I found myself asking one thing many times: what in the world was (fill in the actor, director, etc.) thinking? Besson, who gave us such amusing and occasionally brilliant fare as Leon and Nikita, went way off the deep end. Milla Jovovich, who worked so well with Besson in The Fifth Element, delivers every line as if she's being forced to overact. John Malkovich is about as French as a quesadilla. Etc. One wonders why this got a big-screen release and Christian Duguay's incredibly superior three-hour Joan of Arc, release the same year, got relegated to TV miniseries status.  Mother always said that if you can't say anything good, then shut up. So I'll just say that if you're looking for a modern retelling of the tale of St. Joan, Duguay's version is available on DVD. Rent it. Forget this exists. *  (only because Dustin Hoffman actually gives a halfway decent performance; too bad he's only got about ten minutes of screen time.)
1 ||| Well, you can be sure you'll be treated to your fair share of glorious Plantagenet hairdos if you rent this DVD. Almost everyone in the (fabulous) cast - even John Malkovich - has one. But alas the hair styles are about the only source of genuine cheer; almost everything else is a let-down. Malkovich had a peach of a part as the dastardly, conniving Dauphin, but played it amazingly straight, with nary a hint of the cheeky chappie the role was crying out for. What would Alan Rickman have made of it, I wonder. Or even Bruce Willis? He certainly wasn't helped by the dreadful pacing of the first half - it is a full hour before Joan has even got her army, let alone used it - the first 60 minutes being devoted to tedious back story leading to Joan's appearance in the Dauphin's court; by turns voyeuristic (was she a virgin? Spend ten minutes finding out!), gratuitously violent (the murder and necrophilia of Joan's sister), and just plain daft (recurring visions of a remarkably camp Jesus in a forest surrounded by wolves). The gratuitous violence is a serious blight on the film; the murder/rape scene was arguably relevant to the plot but still was depicted with more detail and relish than necessary, and the remainder of the film overflows with dogs, wolves and crows gobbling human carrion and more battlefield amputations and decapitations than probability would dictate. I'm sure these earned the film its 18 restriction when, fundamentally, it could have quite easily avoided them. But for all the above, I think the main problem with this film is Luc Besson himself. The early stages are laden with meaningless cliches - wolves streaming through the forest, girl running through meadows - and laboured imagery (crucifix, fire, dripping blood and a combination thereof) which get the film off to a bad start from which it never recovers. And thereafter Besson unwisely tries to have a bob each way. On one hand, he takes the historically faithful/dramatised documentary angle - this is really how it happened, you see - but on the other he plays the dreamy, psychedelic/quasi-spiritual card at the same time. Which isn't how it happened, at all. Most peculiar were Joan's visions of Jesus. It really isn't clear what we are meant to take from these: Did Joan really see visions of Jesus (as a boy and - heavily made up with eye-shadow, a beard and a toga - apparently as a member of Slade), or was she simply a paranoid schizophrenic, not in need of an army to march on the British so much as Professional Help? Besson doesn't answer this fundamental question, and the introduction of Dustin Hoffman at the end of the film, seemingly imbued with magical powers, really doesn't help. I still don't know what Hoffman was meant to do in the film or who he was. Was he Jesus? Was he Joan's conscience? Or just more evidence that she really was nuts? Or was HE the lead guitarist from Slade? All in all, hairdos aside, a pretty dissatisfying night in.
0 ||| Where to start criticizing this movie? It fails so miserably on so many levels that it's difficult to know where to begin. It's obvious from watching this movie that the people who made it either didn't read the historical facts concerning Joan or did read them and simply chose to ignore them. Furthermore, you would never know Joan of Arc was a devout Catholic from seeing this movie. Aside from a few one sentence requests to see a priest, Joan's deep faith and spirituality are totally left out. Not that Milla Jovovich has that kind of range as an actress anyway but couldn't they have at least tried? Other than that I don't know what to say about a movie that seems to go out of its way to demonize a young girl who, by all contemporary accounts, was literally a living saint. It's just a terrible movie. Please don't waste your money.
1 ||| He has ever had passion to explore some aspects of women, but now he's a "grown up". I don't want to see Englishmen, Americans and French themselves playing French in a movie describing history facts, we can not find THE REASON France fought with England when those emotions has been confused a lot. Though I like Milla Jovovich, always. About French's madness, if you are interested in it's beauty and mystery (in this movie, it is expressed little and not so completely), I recommend "Beatrice" and "the ninth gate"(but I've ever seen few French movies). Notice how those people betray God; the ways are funny sometimes and beautiful sometimes, though are cruel (cruelty is based on despair) the same time, of course. I don't know how successful the two movies are, in trying to touch the thought of God, since I myself do not really understand God and find it is hard to understand a little more; at least I am sure they are closer than this one.
0 ||| Despite a promising start , I found the movie extremely disappointing. There was some good acting but the storyline completely distorted the message of Joan of Arc. Instead of the courageous and noble young lady that I believe her to have been ,in this post-modernistic , oversophisticated era of cheap thrills she is portrayed as a pschotic ,ultraneurotic who the movie seems to suggest was motivated by selfish and bloodthirsty reasons which anyone who has studied Joan of Arc would know is not true (Read or see George Bernhard Shaw's Saint Joan which shows more genius in one sentence than this movies wise guy writers and producers could ever write in their collective lifetimes) I am going to see the other Joan of Arc video and hope it is better than this one and reflects the genuine values of freedom and justice which so many older movies (but also quite a few new ones ) more satisfyingly portray
0 ||| Being a person who admired the Joan of Arc of our history, I was very much looking forward to the releasal of "The Messenger."  I had hoped it would portray Joan in an updated version. How wrong I was. For starters, the movie ran just too long.  Movies that are long that people don't mind, such as "Forrest Gump" are tolerated because they were good.  This movie was just plain bad. Aside from the fact there are fabricated characters such as Dustin Hoffman's "Conscious," it was historically inaccurate.  John Malkovich was too old to play Charles, the interactions Joan had with the English were looked over in order to spruce up the special effects of the wars and it just simply concentrated on the wrong topics of her story.  I wanted to know more about Joan, not watch the soldiers brutalize each other. The great disservice this screenplay did was portray Joan as insane rather than having a gift from God.  Only a few "miracles" were actually illustrated, such as Joan picking Charles out of a crowd.  Jovovich's portrayal of Joan as a shuddering, twitching mental patient was simply unnerving, not at all enlightening.  Historic reports indicated that Joan was not at all like the movie version -- quite the opposite in fact. This movie is also more graphic than I could bear.  The raping of her sister's corpse was just plain disgusting -- as well as false.  This did not happen and Joan's visions began way before any catastrophe... The Messenger concentrates too much on special effects and the action factor of war.  Joan is dismissed as a saint in this movie and merely portrayed as an insane woman who pretty much got lucky with people listening to her rants.  I have never been so disgusted in my life with a biopic, which is usually what we expect -- a factual version of a historical figure.  My recommendation is to SKIP this... and look up an older version of the movie or check out PBS' website for information on specials of Joan of Arc -- they care more about facts than special effects and shock value...
0 ||| Holy Cow!  Who told model-girl she could act?  I'm sure the casting director who made the call is long out of work by now.  The only redeeming quality of this film is Dustin Hoffman.  Other than that, it's a total joke.  Even John Malkovich made me wretch (and I usually love him). If you're really curious, rent it, or maybe catch it as it flies out of someone's window, or perhaps you'll find a copy at the dump?
0 ||| This stinkeroo is getting as much effort from me in this review as director Luc Besson put into his scenario.  Yow!! Luc Besson has made some awful movies, but this one has got to be among the very worst, and is certainly the most blatantly dishonest and ugly.
1 ||| Milla Jovovich as Joan of Arc. No. I don't think so. She tries, she really does. She invests her all into this role, and sometimes she does very well. But does she inspire legions of men to defend her and to defend France? Does she convey the kind of passion and compassion that could inspire so many men to believe in her? I think Jovovich errs too much in that she plays the role a little too far down the "insanity" line. This is a debate for some... was Joan of Arc a holy, saintly woman who really heard voices or was she simply insane? Who will ever know for sure? In this portrayal though Jovovich overacts and instead of conveying the passion of someone for whom her religion is sacred she conveys insanity. The story of Joan of Arc has been done better and more convincingly, and this film, while visually stunning, does not compare to earlier versions. Nice try.
0 ||| I've been a fan of the console version of "Resident Evil" ever since it was released on Playstation. However, the live-action production was an EXTREME disappointment. They basically mutilated the video game story (which was brilliant by the way), and turned it into this new-age pile of .... Combined with a thrown together plot, terrible acting, and having not one solitary *scary* moment, this movie looked bad next to digestive waste. I mean c'mon; where's the S.T.A.R.S. team? Where's the spooky libraries and bloodthirsty crows? I certainly don't recall any computerized defense system in the video game mansion. It was simple; savage dobermans, cannibalistic zombies, and numerous random monsters created by the T-virus. The game was thrilling, it had a style unlike any other console thriller ever created. It gave people goosebumps, it made you afraid to walk down dark hallways after you played it, and for the more timid, yet determined gamers, it made you do things such as sleep with some sort of weapon next to you, and the lights turned on. But this movie, every single shred of it was horrifying - horrifyingly stupid, that is. If the rating system could go any lower, I'd rate this movie about a negative 3 stars. I'm ashamed I actually bought a ticket to go see it, may the lord forgive me for being such an imbecile.
1 ||| Visually interesting. Alas, for a plot. Someone breaks into a high-security biological warfare lab, steals a new virus, & just for the fun of it, as he leaves, he tosses a vial of the stuff against the wall, breaking it; then he tries to get away. Fearing contamination, the high-tech super-computer that runs the lab's security decides to kill everyone in the complex! Not only that, it offs a few people in interesting ways; but you're left wondering - what for? Surely such a complex would be able to isolate the affected area? Why'd everyone have to die? Next, a specialist security unit has to get in to discover what happened. What they discover is row after row of coffin like containers, each housing one of the now dead staff members. And, of course, they're all brain-hungry zombies just waiting to get let out! This film is garbage. Sure, there's some well secquenced fight scenes, & they way the computer tries offing the specialist secutirty unit is also interesting. Obviously this computer is highly original, and uses its artisitc bent in coming up with ways to kill people.
1 ||| You know I have heard a lot of people love this movie, but when I watched it I was utterly dissapointed.  I have played every Resident Evil game that has came out and I loved every single one of them.  One of the things I liked about the game was the well developed plot.  This movie does a horrible thing to that plot.  First the movie is about a a virus that allows the dead to come to life as zombies that wander lifelessly feeding off human flesh.  First the mansion would have been better left off the movie entirly it served no purpose other than to give us a few glimpses.  Whatever they did to the police teams was atrocious and it still leaves me confused.  The movie throws you into a situation where the police are holding people hostage during a raid on the house.  I must say the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent special effects, but they do not make up for the mutilated and awkward plot that was created.
1 ||| This movie uhhhh, stunk. Period. Milla Jovovich was so bad I wanted to burn HER not Joan...HER! In fact all the acting from the "stars" was horrible including John Malkovich who you'd think would excel in such a role. The fight scenes were so utterly ridiculous...as in: Joan gets shot with the arrow while on the ladder and suddenly the BATTLE STOPS!! INCREDIBLE. The attempts at humorous banter were so bad it actually makes you uncomfortable. About the only redeeming quality of this waste of a movie is the scenic landscapes. And thats the ONLY reason I  gave it 2 stars.
0 ||| I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in a movie.  This was historically inaccurate beyond belief.  It almost seemed like it was making Joan out to be the villain.  If you want to see a good movie on Joan Of Arc, see the "Joan Of Arc" movie that was on TV.
1 ||| It seems that Luc Besson is capable of reaching deep inside of this Milla Jojovich and bringing out a beautiful monster.  Her portrayal of one of the least understood of our most famous icons is intense, and thoughtful - bringing the viewer full circle around the character of Joan of Arc. Unfortunately, Jojovich is the the only relief from what is a long and generously violent flick.  There are a number of "spirtual" moments in the film which deal with her supposed communication with God.  However, it is apparent that Besson has his predetermined notions as to whether Joan of Arc was indeed divine or disturbed and we are never really given the opportunity to consider the other. Unfortunately for Besson, this is the first movie to involve knights, castles, and battles since Braveheart(Gibson, 1995) which seems to have become the obvious comparison.  Even the "revenge" story is not dissimilar enough from the Braveheart "righteous revenge" theme to encourage excitement about The Messenger. Even an "Obi-Wan Kenobi" style performance from Dustin Hoffman does not detract from the fact that by the time you have sat through The Messenger, you will really feel that you have seen it all before.
1 ||| I bought this in the vague hope of stumbling on one more underpublicized and underappreciated (in the US) French masterpiece such as Claude Berri's  Queen Margot.  Not quite!  There are certainly aspects of brilliance here  both in the cinematography and Mila Jovovich's performance, but there is a  tremendous amount of anarchy and occasional apparent aimlessness in the  plot.  Of course the Joan of Arc story is well known, but many times, the  director seemed to let things ramble on without good tie ins.  It's a long  film, but that shouldn't be a vice.  Here it is, because long portions  could be cut without harming the overall effect.  Better yet, the themes  could have been better established and linked and the character development  focused better.  Apart from the title character, everyone else was pretty  much constructed of cardboard. What really offended me about The Messenger was the  dialogue, which in many places is simply ludicrous.  There is plenty of  90's colloquialism and plenty of medieval cliche, but very little authentic  sounding conversation reflecting the status relationships between French  nobility (and royalty) and peasants.  At the same time, there are some  cheap, Keystone coppish antics in which the ostensible army leaders bumble  like the Three Stooges, while Joan takes some implausible action.  In these  respects, at least, The Messenger demonstrates that the Hollywood lowest  common denominator can be at home on the Continent as well.  This sort of  triviality really disappoints me, as I think it did a lot to mediocratize  another film which should have been very good, Mel Gibson's Patriot.  All  in all, what is frustrating is that this could also have been a very worthy  effort, perhaps memorable, but fails because the whole was far less than  the sum of the parts.
1 ||| Unfocused, overproduced, over-ambitious and overlong, that is the best way to describe this uneven period action movie/tragedy/religious melodrama. That's really too bad because it had potential and some great actors in it;  Faye Dunaway, John Malkovich and Dustin Hoffman. Starting with the cast,  Mila Jovovich was simply wrong for the role, 'Joan of Arc' is just as  complex a character as 'Blance DuBois', it was just too difficult for her  but who can blame her for trying. She was miscast in a vital role and  overdoes it a lot, but then she isn't even an actress, she was originally a  model that's always been typecast for roles where exotic looks where  needed. Faye Dunaway is under-appreciated, John Malkovich is simply miscast  in a role that makes him look silly and childish and Dustin Hoffman just  plain seems awkward in the role of devil?/angel?/conscience?. For a period  film it is too Hollywoodized, strange considering the French cast and  foreign director, it also fails to capture the times with silly accents and  unimpressive sets, costumes and makeup. The battle scenes have an extremely  low credibility level and look cartoonish. And the 'miracle sequences'  where Joan is visited by God are ridiculous, the guy that plays Jesus  looked more like a freak that the son of God, his looks are really  distracting. It tries to be 'Braveheart' (a much better film) at times but  fails miserably and near the end it violently changes direction to  religious melodrama. This are the film's best scenes where they start to  question whether Joan really saw God and even those sequences are overlong.  And the final burning at the stake, which should of been poignant or  dramatically successful is dull and unrewarding. The stylized direction by  Besson is completely inadequate here, it works well in films like 'La Femme  Nikita' (his best film) or even 'The Professional', but not here. Note: if  Joan really saw God (and I'm not saying she didn't), I wonder why he  preferred the French armies to the English, there's a religious  contradiction right there. God loves all and doesn't wish war and  manslaughter for anybody. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 4!
1 ||| Gosh, this film disagreed with me. Overlong, extremely shallow and with a tone that varies from comical slapstick to brutal fight sequences, watching  this film at that cinema was a mind, heart and buttock-numbing exercise.  Confirming the suspicion that Luc Besson is essentially a grown-up man with  a child's understanding of cinema, it's stylish, inconsistent, and with no  depth of any kind. The film seems like a terrible waste of talent -  Jovovich's edgy, verging-on-madness portrayal of the title character,  whilst never particularly subtle, nonetheless explodes with gusto, and the  battle sequences are highly entertaining in a grim and gritty,  post-'Excalibur' style. The rest of the film is a mess, though. Jeanne's  heavenly visions contain the worst kind of cliched mid-80's pop video  imagery imaginable, not a single line of dialogue stands out (except for  the well-known transcriptions of Jeanne's trial, taken from court records  of the time), and Eric Serra's music sounds rooted in the 1930's, when it  isn't using a 'Fifth Element'-style breathy 'thrum' noise. The tone veers  alarmingly - the opening sequence features Asterix-style comic English  soldiers, pantomime crooked teeth and all, brutally raping and murdering  Jeanne's sister. Later on, Jeanne's expedition to attack Paris is reduced  to a 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'-style 'attack the castle' fiasco,  whilst the ending tries a stab at indie art, with Dustin Hoffman as  Jeanne's 'conscience'. And it's much too long.
0 ||| An unusual movie, but ultimately an embarassing failure.  Beautiful cinematography and costuming cannot rescue this false, bloated, at times ridiculous, reprise of the story of Jeanne d'Arc. The problems can be  stated precisely: 1) Luc Besson.  2) Milla Jovovich. Besson's Jeanne is  a bellowing lunatic and latter day feminist with a wicked right cross.  She  lounges in bed until midday then furiously berates her commanders for  starting the battle without her.  Similarly, her knights can be found  sleeping late (in full armour!) on the battlefield with the English Army  directly to their front.  The English in their turn are mercilessly  pilloried as a race of brutal proto nazis, well...OK. These are just a few  of the film's more besetting problems.  Besson's Jeanne comes across as not  a maid, but a madwoman worthy of institutionalization, if not the stake. Likewise, Milla Jovovich's Jeanne is an insult to her memory.  Alternately screaming, squeaking,  pouting and hallucinating... It is  difficult to imagine teenage boys following such a girl around a swimming  pool, let alone hardened campaigners following her into battle.  One finds  one's self looking forward to her execution. Jeanne's story deserves  much better treatment than she gets in this deplorable film.
1 ||| If two great film artists, Carl-Theodore Dreyer and Robert Bresson, saw fit to restrict their talents to Joan of Arc's "passion" and "trial," then what on earth Luc Bresson thought he could do with  her whole story is sheer megalomania.  An action film director, he simply  hasn't the skill to capture one of history's greatest enigmas on film -  even with a large budget and an international cast.  And he is clearly  besotted with Milla Jovovich - else why would he cast her in The Fifth  Element as 'the perfect human?'  She is so out of her depth in this role  that she's embarrassing to watch - turning poor Joan into a complete  neurotic.  The film suggests that the real puzzle of history is not that  Joan of Arc led a French army into battle - and won - but that the Dauphin  and his ministers actually permitted this apparent nut case to do so.  She  obviously hadn't the imagination - neither did Besson - to look deeply into  this young woman's soul and find something authentic - like a 15th-century  peasant girl made so ecstatic by her visions and voices (made ridiculous in  the movie) that she convinced enough of her countrymen that she was sent to  liberate them.  I can think of maybe two or three living actresses who  could pull it off, but they're far too old to play a 19-year-old.  Viewers  should purchase the newly restored and gloriously remastered Passion of  Joan of Arc to get glimpses of what art can do with the enigma of Joan.

0 ||| There are so many things wrong with this movie, I'm not quite sure where to begin!  I guess I could start with historical accuracy.  I knew trouble was abrewin' when I found out that John Malkovich was playing the French  King Charles, who was actually only 19 years old!  Lots of silly,  fictitious stuff was added about the various people at court who supposedly  convinced Charles to betray Joan. And one of Joan's big motivations was  shown to be the rape and murder of her sister, which has no basis in  fact. Second major problem:  Acting.  Joan was played as if she were  constantly about to fall down sobbing and have a nervous breakdown.  She  came across as a total nutcase.  There's no way anyone would have followed  Joan if  she acted the way she was portrayed here. There were also many  unintentionally funny parts.  I  tried hard not to laugh out loud when  Dustin Hoffman popped up as Joan's conscience mouthing the most ludicrous  dialogue you can imagine. I could go on and on, but instead, I'll  recommend that instead of this movie, you should watch the old silent  version called The Passion of Joan of Arc.  That one will affect you and  haunt your memory (in a good way) for a long time.
1 ||| Not being an owner of a game console such as a Playstation and the like, I have never spent much time actually playing any of the Resident Evil series. I tried to play them on my PC, but it always seemed like my top of the line PC was being dumbed down by playing console games on it, like it was getting a headache trying to think on the same level as a console. That said, I have however seen the games played by many of friends and know the Resident Evil stories, read some of the comics and a couple of the novels. I know and like the characters and all of the playable ones like Claire Redfield or Jill Valentine. Both have one quality, among others, that Mila Jovovich lacks in abundance- her character Alice is not very likeable. In fact, she isn't much of anything, she isn't even that attractive.  The Resident Evil movie also has very little in common with its console video game forebears- other than it's title and that it has an evil corporation named Umbrella which has made a terrible virus that turns people into flesh eating zombies. Now, to me, this sounds like a match made in heaven. I'm a graduate of the George A. Romero school of zombie flicks and cut my teeth on Night, Dawn and Day of the Dead. I make no apologies for like spectacular gore- I want to see people being ripped in half with their intestines and other organs spilling out on the floor with wet goopy splatting noises like a bowl of rotten fruits being tipped over. I want limbs hacked off. I want people using 500 bullets to kill something instead of using just one. I want Peter Jackson `Bad Taste' and `Brain Damage' level gore. Resident Evil the movie has flesh eating zombies, but very little gore, very little actual eating of flesh. Almost none. So, what's the point?  Anyway, the film is pretty much an amalgamation of some of the game stories, namely the virus being released and Umbrella trying to cover it up by gassing the residents of a watch house after someone attempts to steal the virus and purposely releases it. Alice, who awakes in the shower, has no memories of her past and is suddenly thrust in the middle of a commando raid as Umbrella attempts to gain access to `The Hive'- their massive underground research facility where the `T'-virus was made and subsequently released. Now, in the video game, everything Umbrella owns is made of rusted steel and looks to be about a hundred years old or painted a sickly medicinal green and splattered with mud and blood. The film, however, everything is cut from polished stainless steel and aluminum, all very sanitary and high tech, which doesn't fit the milieu.  The commandos realize they'll have take down a powerful hologram-based AI known as the Red Queen, because she controls the whole Hive and they suspect she's insane. Entering through a glass corridor we get to watch as most of the team is cut into meat by lasers, including the grid laser seen in the commercial. But they wimp out- we barely see Number 1 cut into giblets Sylvester-running-through-the-chain-link-fence style, and get a semi decent slow motion decapitation. Now, in my mind, after the first laser had passed and killed two of the commandos, the next obvious move would be to roll a couple of grenades down the hallway- made entirely out of glass!! Instead, no, everyone dies, leaving only Alice, three commandos and a ineffectual cop to deal with it all.  All in all, this film is nothing like the video games. None of its characters are likeable and truth be told, I wanted them all to die. However, the production values are very high and they obviously put a lot of care and thought into the end product. I'm also a big fan of Jon Anderson- Event Horizon will always be one of my favorite films. But in Resident Evil he changed too much, took too much away from the games that made them so effective. Very few of the monsters made it to the screen save for the lickers, which were underused and the undead skinless dogs, again, underused. Notice I have said much about the zombies? I haven't because there aren't exactly a lot of them, nor a lot of scenes with them.  It's a zombie movie! For crying out loud, this is what people paid money to see and they give a very poor account of themselves. In this is where the film really falls apart- the zombies just didn't look dead enough, for the most part. It's like the make-up artists gave up before they were finished. The zombies didn't looked decayed enough, weren't feral enough, weren't missing enough body parts or bleeding enough. In short, they were one of the least satisfying portions of the film. I want gore...not scene after scene of high tech equipment and mean spirited characters with very few redeeming qualities. Dawn of the Dead could get away with being a character drama as well as a satirical portrait and scathing indictment of our consumerism-based society. Resident Evil is about gore and killing zombies in as many disgusting ways as possible and nothing else. Worse, the music had me reaching for an icepick to puncture my own eardrums it was so terrible.
1 ||| The score to this film was flawless but, the movie itself is just another average in my book. Marilyn Manson did the score for this movie and he did  a job! If you watch the commentary to this movie they said that they didn't want to show zombies in the beginning because, you knew that you were gonna see some any way. The film didn't even have enough gore to be a serious zombie movie. I give this 2.5 stars.
1 ||| Sexy security operative (Jovovich) wakes up one night with amnesia, then gets ambushed by a commando squad and led into an underground research facility over-run by flesh-eating zombies. More entertaining than one would expect from another video-game adaption, but the visual effects are so laughably poor and the concept so ridiculous that most die-hard horror fans will see this to be a direct rip-off of George A. Romeros zombie films. Ten points to anyone who can figure out Jovovichs characters name before the credits.
1 ||| I actually give this 2 1/2 stars. After watching Milla Jovovitch in The  Fifth Element, I was enchanted.  So much facial expression and wonderful  potential as a great actress.  Her acting doesn't disappoint in this film  either.  The others in the cast are in top form also; John Malkovitch,  Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway all give wonderful performances.  The  photography is stunning, the battles are exhilarating.  And yet the movie  falls short because of the poor presentation.  There was no real  connection, flow, or even story line between the battle sequences and her  dream sequences.  The editing fell short in tying the remarkable individual  elements into one sensible theme.  As another reviewer mentioned, it would  have been better if this movie had less going for it from the start, such  as the superb acting and extraordinary visuals.  By the time we get toward  the end of the movie when her conscious appears, I just wanted the movie to  end.
1 ||| If you think that this is an inspiring movie such as Braveheart which Mel Gibson acted so brilliantly as Sir Richard Wallace, you would be extremely disappointed with this offering. Luc Besson's movies are always interesting  to watch with beautiful cinematography & French flair. But this latest  offering, despite it still shares those traits, it could become  disillusioned at times.  I couldn't stand Milla Jovovich running around the  set screaming her head off.  If I were one of her soldiers, I wouldn't be  inspired by her at all to fight for France.  Rather, the English looked  more like those civilised type.  With due respect, Milla is not a bad  actress after seeing her in the Fifth Element & her minor role as the  prostitute in You've Got Game with Denzel Washington.  So, the decision for  her to depict Joan as that mad woman is questionable.  The part of her  arguing with her conscience acted by Dustin Hoffman is like watching X  Files, you want to know the truth but the truth you shall not find.  At  times, I just wished that she could be burned & done with so that I  could get on with life.  Well, a completely forgettable film & I  wouldn't dream of watching it one more time, just like putting myself over  a guillotine.  Having said that, Faye Dunaway & John Malkovich were  superb in their amoral roles being calculative, manipulative, conniving to  serve their own interests.
0 ||| Lame, shallow and dumb, are just a very few words I will mention to describe this movie.  This movie's is basically a bunch of speical effects strung together by a shallow story line that really does not end with any real resolution other than to look out for part 2.  On top of that you may notice that this movie "samples"  ideas from other movies such as Andromeda Strain - compare the Hive to Andromeds's underground installation as well as the Hive's computer system to the automatic self-destruct mechanism in Andromeda Stain.  Speaking of computers, where else have you seen a computer go on a killing spree? Here's a hint 2001. Another steal was from Night Of The Living Dead where dead bodies are hijacked and commissioned to wreak havoc on the living.  If you want a real thrill get your self the game and start playing.  You will get 10 times the substance and all of your money's worth.  Quite frankly I do not see what is so not helpful about this.  Obviously those who did not find this helpful have no idea about the game in which this movie is supposed to be based on.  Surely it's packed with a lot of suspense and action, but it did not follow the game in anyway.  I found this movie lame and somewhat of a rip-off from other movies.
1 ||| I have seen three films based on the life of Joan of Arc, the Ingrid Bergman film from the late 1940's, the video verison of the recent mini-series and this one, and this is, by far, the worst of the three.  Historically, it is a farce, (Joan did in fact have a sister named  Catherine, but she was not in any way harmed by the English, in fact,  Joan's village apparently only suffered one minor raid during the entire  war)...Bishop Cauchon, far from wanting to "save Joan's soul" was  the spearhead of the plot to completly discredit her and have her burned.  Neither did she sign with an "X"one of her letters to the English  garrisons around Orleans still survives in a museum and the  signature,Jeanne, which is what she called herself is plain...All period  sources agree on how even tempered she was, becoming upset only on very  rare occasions.  The Joan of this film seems closer to a lunatic than the  peasant girl who led an army. I will admit that the costuming is superb, as  good as any I have ever seen. Joan's spiritual side in this film is almost  non-existent, shown only by her requests to hear Mass during her  imprisonment.  As it stands, I only give this film two star based on the  cimenatography and the costuming...The great "Joan of Arc" film  is still to be made....
1 ||| NOW what? For the life of me, I can't imagine why Besson thought that the world needed (yet) another Joan of Arc movie. The "real" Joan wasn't even considered important in France until the 1800's, when her story  was resurrected (and embellished - current scholarship doubts whether  Orleans was actually under siege at all!) But (sigh), he decided to give it  his *treatment*, and this is what we end up with: two and a half hours of  his wife (and "Leeloo" from "The Fifth Element")  alternately screaming, shrieking, or whimpering in the face of anyone who  happens to be standing by. The scrolling text at the opening of the film  was illegible and flipped by so quickly no one could read it, not that it  seemed to matter. Any "plot" is sublimated to the "art"  - gorgeous photography, lush scenery, and realistically violent battle  scenes. Warning - this is serious stuff, not a candied-up rendition of  medieval warfare. Back in those days, you took out your enemy not by  gunfire, but by debilitating them in as serious fashion as possible,  including maces, axes, the ubiquitous swords, and some even less pleasant  and graphically-demonstrated methods. But along the way, Besson loses  whatever guiding vision originally prompted him to make this film.  Characters start to answer questions with "Whatever", the  Dauphine (John Malkovich playing the usual invertebrate) seems less  interested in being King than he is in where the cast party will be, Faye  Dunaway snaps and snarls in a puzzling way (one minute she's Joan's biggest  patron, only to turn on her with no discernable motivation), and in one of  the BIGGEST casting bloopers in the last half of the 20th century, Dustin  Hoffman shows up looking like a retread Obi Wan Kenobe, sounding like  Dustin Hoffman, and is supposed to be "The Conscience"  (apparently because the gaping plot holes required SOME sort of cinematic  asphalt to keep the audience at least partially "in" on what is  supposed to be transpiring). This is certainly the most serious problem  with the movie: if Hoffman is intended to be a sort of mental foil ,  voicing Joan's inner doubts, he certainly takes his time in making his  presence known. If the movie is intended to illuminate Joan's  "human" aspects (as opposed to her spiritual side), then  three-quarters of the film is wasted on one battle scene after another with  nary a glimmer of self-doubt or moral questioning. Buckets of blood, to be  sure. No, this isn't the "thinking man's Joan" by a looooong  shot. The film is irritatingly anachronistic (see "whatever"),  and crippled by  hopelessly befuddled motivations and seriously  one-dimensional acting by people who should know better AND by the lead,  but in her case, being the director's current "significant other"  must have gone a long way. Besson's fans will appreciate the cinematography  and the hyper-kinetic pacing of so many scenes, but those with a taste for  subtlety, or serious philosophic enquiries, or even historical accuracy  will find the two and a half hour length about an hour too long.
1 ||| Was she a prophet? Was she a nut? Perhaps she was a sly and highly intelligent manipulator. Maybe she was a feminist in an age of male domination who decided to use God as a ladder to French Royalty. All  interesting possiblities. All completely ignored by this film. I doubt that  even Luc Besson could explain what he thought of Joan of Arc and he doesn't  even try to here. Depite battle sequences that are almost on par with those  of Braveheart, a terrifc cast giving superb performances, and stunning  visuals the film falls completely flat . I would've prefered it if the film  had nothing good in it. It would have been easier to dismiss, but the  presence of such great elements makes the whole that much more of a  disappointment. Milla Jovovich gives her all in the lead role, Malkcovich  is as usual terrific as the sly back stabbing king, Faye Dunaway wreaks of  menace despite being underused. Then we come to Dustin Hoffman as The  Conscience, who I think is Besson's attempt at redeaming himself. After  roaming through the first half of the film, giving us battle sequence after  another, dream sequence after another, all which look magnifecent, but by  the third time you see them you start wondering if he is going anywhere  with this, he doesn't. The Conscience is his feeble attempt at  understanding Joan, but it comes too late, and by then we are not so much  interested in understanding her, as much as we are hoping that the film  would end. By the time the film is over you'll be thinking to yourself,  what a waste of lots of great elements in this completely pointless mess.  Note: The film was released outside America under the title Joan of Arc,  which despite being used before, is a much better title then The Messenger:  The Story Of Joan of Arc which sound more like a TV move then a cinamatic  release.
0 ||| Never have I been so disappointed by a movie. Joan of Arc - France's patron saint - a real-life person, portrayed like a super hero.  It might have worked better if they'd added the cartoon 'Sock' , 'Bam', and 'Pow'  during fight scenes.  All I can tell you is AFTER seeing this, I happened  to catch "The Passion of Joan of Arc" on Turner Classic Movies,  and thought it was a contemporary film.  I was shocked to learn the film  was done in 1928!  So my advice is to leave this 'glam trash Fishtar'  version on the shelf, and buy the REAL DEAL instead -  "The Passion of  Joan of Arc" (1928). .
0 ||| Yeah this movie is terrible. This film relies completely on those slit second scare tactics. Where it's really quite one second and then there's a loud noise which usually turns out to be nothing. When there is something, such as a zombie, it's not scary. The zombies are very boring. They stumble slowly to their victims. They're so frail you'd think they could just be pushed over. Which is how it is in the 'Resident Evil' video game. Which is why this game never should have been made into a film. I do like the games but the plot just isn't strong enough for the big screen. If they want to make a scary game into a movie they should have chosen 'Silent Hill.' It's not so corny. Not all video game movies are completely stupid. 'Tomb Raider' managed to faithfully bring Lara Croft to the big screen and actually improve her image. Sorry Capcom, 'Street Fighter' failed and so did 'Resident Evil.'
1 ||| First, let me say this with confidence: "Resident Evil" starts with nastiness, and then goes to downright nastiness till the end.  I like Milla Jovovich, so as far as she is on the screen, it's OK.  But the film itself is ... awful.  Not that it fails to entertain us.  It is often scary (some of the kids were jumping in the seat, it's true).  Its production designs are decent.  However, the director Paul W.S. Anderson doens't know one thing: originality. The story is about Alice and the squad with special mission, who have to (they are told) to shut down the main computer of The Hive, underground institute specializing in the study of lethgal virus.  An accident there changes the workers (and dogs too) into zombies, and in this deadly place with booby traps, Alice in undergraund has to fight with a vengeance. OK. ...are  As it is, fondly remembering James Cameron and David Twohy, I started to get bored after a while, the film being completely relying on shock tactics of sudden big "Bang!" and strongly suggested violence. Jovovich (a bit one-note) is so-so, though lacking the presense of Jolie; Michelle Rodriguez is good, but I frankly thought they are wasting the time and the career.  All in all, just a passable flick though I strongly recommend that you  watch "Aliens" instead.
1 ||| Resident Evil was fascinating as a visual, technical piece but overall empty as a movie.  And as a horror movie, there were no thrills, no jumps, no real scares.  I anticipated every zombie, mutant doggie jummping out from corners.  Most of all, I kept wondering why Milla Jovovich, who is such a good actress, deliverd such a flat and emotionaless performance.
1 ||| I`m one of the fans of the video game {Resident Evil} the game is really scary but with the movie nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects in fact the video game is a lot more fun than the film. All we hope for is some cool special effects and fight scenes But even on that level, "Resident Evil" is a disappointment. I do not think being a fan of the game could've possibly improved my enjoyment of this film.
1 ||| RESIDENT EVIL is one of those movies you go into knowing that you won't get much out of other than a little dumb fun.  Unfortunately, you don't get much of that here either, thanks  to a razor-thin plot and alot of idea-snatching from superior films. The plot revolves around a company called the Umbrella Corporation, which does illegal viral research in an underground facility called the Hive, which in turn is monitored by an artificial intelligence component called the Red Queen.  After  a security breach, the Red Queen activates a defense mechanism in which all the Hive employees are trapped and summarily killed in the facility.  At this point a tactical unit is dispatched to investigate, and that's where the so-called fun begins.  Again, a movie like this is never known for its' character development or acting range, in which case Milla Jovovich acquits herself admirably in the lead role, looking sufficiently (hacked) off when the scene calls for it.  Michelle Rodriquez does another one of her always-looks-mad-as-hell routines, which seems to be all she's good for and is frankly getting tiresome in every movie that she's in.  All in all, video game afficionados would be better served renting TOMB RAIDER or even one of the MORTAL KOMBAT films. For typical movie-goers, I'd say pass.
1 ||| If you're looking for a great horror movie with an eerie back drop, flesh eating zombies and plenty of blood you're definitely looking in the wrong place! The eerie mansion backdrop of the video game is completely absent instead replaced by an over stylized laboratory and the basic premise of the game (survival horror) is thrown out of the window. Instead you get a bunch of incompetent special forces jerks who have no personality and seem to not think of trying a headshot when the people they shoot get back up after emptying entire magazines into them. This movie plays more like a crappy matrix remake with zombies delivering neck-breaking and kung-fu kicks galore instead of horror. Another thing there's no blood when they shoot 'em in the head just a shot of the gun going off and a quick cut to the tiny bullet hole on the forehead of the zombie; no forehead squibbs! The best thing about this movie is Milla Jovovich gets naked. You can even tell that some of the background in the mess hall tank sequence are 2-D paintings. As for any campy fun, none to speak of; very low gore it's mostly sterile CG stuff, the zombies just seem to nibble not taking a single bloody chunk out of anybody and in my opinion if you can't see it free of charge, don't.
0 ||| I was waiting anxiously for this movie to be released and I am now wondering why.  This was absolutely the worst movie I've seen in years. It is a mish-mosh of totally irrelevant scenarios and I, being a fan of horror for years, lost interest in the first fifteen minutes. If you enjoy the game, do not purchase this film. I have a feeling that we should expect to see Resident Evil 2 on the horizon, due to the ending. Please don't bother.
1 ||| This one should have been "The Night of the Living Dead" of the new millenium. Instead, we get a Matrix-like movie with amateurish directing, an incredibly irritating techno soundtrack and a mistalented cast. Ironically, Paul W.S. Anderson was also the director of 1995's "Mortal Kombat" ; perhaps the ONLY good videogame turned movie in cinema history. The success of this film was due to the fact that it gave the videogame fans what they wished, that is action and plenty of it. Unfortunately, Anderson probably forgot that "Resident Evil" is a horror videogame, NOT an action one. We wanted endless scares, suspense, a creepie environment. We deeply wished to see the dark atmosphere present in the game, but we get nothing of this. All we get is a group of soldiers spending nearly all of the movie wandering through labarotory rooms and shooting bullets which seem never-ending. And speaking of the characters, why does Michelle Rodriguez think she can act? I mean she does nothing other than spending the entire movie looking angry and [mad]at the camera that she becomes incredibly annoying halfway through. And she seems to play the same annoying character in all her movies; just watch "The Fast and the Furious". It was a great pleasure seeing her changed into a zombie at the end, at least we can all hope she will not be in the sequel. It's a real shame that George Romero left the project of directing this movie; I'm sure he would have done a great job. But he had his reasons of not participating; most probably he read the awful script and was discouraged. So why did I give this movie 2 stars? Hmmm, well probably because Milla Jovovich is a real hottie. As a matter of fact, it's thanks to her that I remained to see the movie till the very end. Cause some smart people know that if you're going to make an awful movie, at least bring in the hottie who will make teenagers fall in love and increase the marketing of their product. The same thing can be said to "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider". TRIVIA QUESTION: Try and count the number of microphones that mistakenly pop out at the top of the screen throughout the movie; you'll be surprised. Another vivid proof of a half-hearted attempt to bring a popular videogame franchise to the big screen.
1 ||| Time was, we could find womanizers funny. But no longer. Frank Sinatra is a bit of a cad here, as he toys with the affections of 2 lovely women--Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak. The movie starts, in fact, as Frank ("Pal  Joey") is being run out of town by the police, for trifling with the  affections of an underage girl. Settled in San Francisco, Frank uses Rita  to finance his new supper club, but cannot give up his star act, Kim Novak.  All very shallow, and a rather nice (sweetened up) ending. Not to deny  the power of the songs--Rodgers and Hart at their best. Not to deny the  beauty of the Cinematography--glorious limpid shots of 50's San  Francisco. But that plot!
1 ||| The reason I am saying this is because...poor Rita Hayworth has to share the stage,and spotlight with the new and upcoming star Kim Novak...so it is like move over Rita...and she she didn't even get top billing...but 3rd billing...while that Bozo {Sinatra gets top billing and Kim Novak gets 2nd billing.....now I like Kim Novak and Rita Hayworth...{don't really like Sinatra much at all...he was a lousy actor}...that is why I am giving this movie a 2 star and nothing higher..I like Gilda,and Salome,Affair In Trinidad,Miss Sadie Thompson..Lady From Shanghai,and The Loves Of Carmen...because..personally I believe she can act Kim Novak under the table..or whatever anyday....Rita just has that wonderful talent....and even when she played that role  in Seperate Table with Burt Lancaster...she was in her 40's and still looked great....and the movie got great reviews also..
1 ||| With the great cast and a cool plot, this could have been a pretty good movie.  However, it just takes all the usual scare tactics to new lows (disappearing bodies, constant gore including a very graphic scene involving lazers, etc.).  There is about one cool scene in the whole thing, not including the beginning and end shots of a very exposed Milla Jovovich.  Well, there's always that upcoming sequel...
1 ||| 'Pal Joey" has a terrible plot, a disinterested Sinatra, a gorgeous Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak, never one of my favorites. The music and sound track is the only thing that keeps it above one star. There is no enthusiasm or chemistry of any kind. I am not anti Sinatra. Most of the time he does very well, but not here. This movie is indeed a gasser, but not in a good way. Avoid it.
1 ||| This movie expects the audience to believe that a really unappealing character like Sinatra's Joey would attract two very reasonable women. It's an old idea that has run its course.  The movie gets 2 stars for good music.  Nice clothes, too.
1 ||| This film falls flat in many aspects. I really wanted to like this movie, but the only reason for this was because I am such a huge fan of the games. However, I feel that this film does not do the video game classic justice. It DOES have an all new story, and it DOES have all new characters. However, this surprisingly is not the reason that I disliked it. I am rather thrown off as to why this film is getting such good reviews by other Amazon.com customers, because in my opinion, the movie is a mindless escapade through one obstacle and another. The film tries to go for intense plot twists, however, the makers of the film must not have realized that if they want intriguing plot development, an existent plot is required. The video games really do give you a sense of uneasiness, however, all this film offers is a brainless combination of Night of the Living Dead and Die Hard. People say that it's no big deal that the story doesn't follow the game, but it is. Reason being, the film IS based on the game, so I'm sorry, but YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THE GAME'S PREMISE. I don't give juvenile reviews based on how attractive the lead stars are, OR on the blood content, I base them on how good the movie was, hence the two stars.
1 ||| Rita Hayworth is the only reason for watching this film, and Kim Novak is good. The rest is not good..the script of the original Pal Joey has been completely re-written to accomodate Sinatra, and this means the thinnest of plots, the transposition of songs, elimination of numbers that make him look bad, and the suits and pants with football padding to disguise thinness and age.  This was the musical Sinatra wanted; he was sure he could carry a film, certainly a musical film. He had seen M Brando take the lead in Guys and Dolls,  and he reacted negatively toward Barndo all through the shoot of Guys and Dolls. Thank God Brando secured that lead!  Sinatra's voice in Pal Joey is very bad, his style of acting is no style at all, and his acting, even on its one note foundation,  is excruciating. He needed Gene Kelly and others to fill in when he made MGM musicals; he was never a star, and Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak eclipse him in every scene,proving that point.  Too bad, because this was a very good show, on Broadway, with Gene Kelly, who should have done this picture, or Marlon Brando, certainly Brando.  See this for Rita and her number, Zipped, and forget the rest.  See also, Kim, sing (dubbing)My Funny Valentine, and how it gets ruined as you watch Sinatra's reactions to it.
1 ||| Musicals are historically slight in the plot department, and this movie is no exception.  Three stars: one fading, one rising and one coasting do not help matters either.  Rita is the fading star.  It was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow.  The make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes, and her hair and costumes are just bad.  Novak is the rising star, although I don't get the 50's obsession with bubble headed, busty, bleach blond bimbos.  It would help if she could act, but sadly her range is very limited. I truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic, since she was unable to convey it herself.  Then there is Frank just coasting on his charm and cool.  Doesn't seem plausible that a hep cat like him, who could bag any "doll", "dame" or "mouse?", would fall for either of these gals.  Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because of Snuffy the dog.  He stole every scene he was in.  Although that wasn't too difficult to do in such a dog of a movie.
1 ||| This movie took most of the great songs from the stage play and dumped them.  For a theater lover this is heartbreaking.  What a disappointing story.  If a movie can be faithful to the theater version then this one is a class-A adulterer.  Even the ending was changed and not for the better.  The dubbing for the two leading ladies was also disappointing.  A pretty face is not enough.
1 ||| I do not like Sinatra, and as someone once said, Joey is the role he was born to play.  A self-important little heel.  I think he had a very slight singing voice (with orchestral delusions of grandeur, look at the arrangement of his "Softly, As I Leave You") and I think he was a megalomaniac.  Also, before I drop the subject, the tune in this flick that floored all the other reviewers here ("The Lady Is A Tramp") was written for a woman and has many more, and many cleverer choruses, and was written for "Babes in Arms," not "Pal Joey."  Rita Hayworth (whose character, Vera Simpson, was just rich on the stage) plays a former stripper, not a former singer.  And her number, "Zip!" has words in it not even written by Hart!  The plot of the show (par for Hollywood) was bowdlerized, rewritten and destroyed for the flick, and left simplistic and with most of its songs gone.  Good ones too.  I've read O'Hara's libretto and I've heard the score.  The film is a colorful diversion (like the films of Porter's "Can-Can" and Loesser's "Guys and Dolls," both also with Sinatra, both also eviscerated and abridged, though Loesser fared best of the three), it'll kill an hour and a half, Rodgers' tunes are done well (as well as non-singers can do them), O'Hara and Hart are rewritten with only the bare bones left, but in 2003, who really cares anymore.  Rodgers & Hart will be around when this shadow of one of their best shows (almost all their shows were their best shows, they were gems, but this one had a script by John O'Hara, sigh, what a waste) is forgotten.  Watch it, feel good (if you can stand Sinata; Novak and Hayworth are talented and beautiful), and then forget it.
1 ||| It bothers me to see that almost all adaptions of Video Games to the screen focus entirely on special effects and not on plot.  Unfortunately Resident Evil is not the exception.  The zombie gore and grosseness is all there is to focus on in the film so the viewer is left waiting for the credits to roll.  There is no balance between the plot and the action.  Leaving this film lacking and boring.
1 ||| I don't understand where all the gore went. Thirteen ghosts was filled with gore that was not needed,this film is based on a video game that was bloody from start to finish,its rated R so why? No zombies show up for 40 min and you only see one mutant creature. The dogs are killed off too fast and with no originality,and yet another slow motion matrix ripoff jump kick. What a waste,they had 40 million dollars and millia jovovich and this is there best.dawn of the dead had almost no money,but they have a 2hr nonstop zombie masterpiece.watch it instead.
1 ||| The Hives set up by the influential Umbrella Corporaton has been secretly conducting genetic experiments and the subterranean lab has unfortunately been plagued by a viral outbreak, taking its toll on the working staff. It is up to Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez with the assistance of cop Eric Mabius to confront and isolate the virus. Accompanying them is an elite task force - and the situation is critical with the time factor going against them. They have to reach the Red Queen, the mother of the computer network that powers and defend the Hive. Unless you are a computer fanatic of the popular Capcom game and its spawned 3 sequels or wanting to get a thrill from seeing the protagonists battling terrifying obstacles through the dark labyrinths, you might want to spare yourself from surviving a horrible movie. It is a splatter of unnecessary gore with decapitated corpses and mindless violence that desensitized rather than offer true scares. The phalanx of cannibals and vampire-like troops eating people alive and animatronic creatures like Licker, Zombie Dogs doesn't exactly fascinate either. Paul WS Anderson who also helmed the cheesy Mortal Kombat makes a movie that is stocked full of grunge rock to compensate for its lack of atmosphere. The only saving grace of the movie is Milla Jovovich hiking up the kick... factor with her resilient mantle. Otherwise the movie is a sputtering mess - and it's a shame when horror-chiller George A Romero of the famed Living Dead trilogy inspired this movie. Resident Evil is butchered unscrupulously into a gore flick which is shockingly horrible instead of terrifying.
1 ||| Terribly dull musical, full of annoying songs and terrible acting
1 ||| It's been six years since I have run out of a movie theater angry and bewildered. This review is really intended for the mature movie-goer. I say this because many of the young adults loved this movie and were having a blast.  I only wish I could have seen what they found so interesting. But hey, I gave it a go.  Even though the critics hate this movie(if you want a real laugh, check out Roger Ebert's review),  the trailer was intoxicating. If you want to know, in depth what the movie is about..see another reviewer's review.  I'll just say here that the plot of an underground, highly classified colony of people, working on unnatural forms of DNA was exciting. When one little vial gets dropped, the computer system shuts the plant down, literally. Everyone is killed to contain the contamination.  The first 50 minutes were decent, but when really awful and unconvincing zombies jumped out of the woodwork, the movie could not redeem itself (think of zombies from knock-off flicks of the original "Night of the Living Dead"). This is when 11 or more people, including ourselves walked out of the theater.   There was rumor that this movie is based on a PC game of the same title.  I play many PC games and would appreciate if someone would email me and elaborate.  If this is true, that could be the reason why the younger crowd was so enthusiastic about this flick. I give the movie two stars for suspense, a great initial plot, and choosing Milla Jovovich as the lead. I enjoy her acting, she is blossoming into a great actress.  In all, this movie felt like a combination of "Aliens", "Ghosts of Mars", "Return of the Living Dead", and "Relic".  It's a mish-mash of many great film ideas...but the ridiculous zombies were the movie's downfall. If they were more realistic, and frightening, instead of laughable, the movie might have succeeded.
1 ||| I thought this would be more child friendly, but the actions of the lady who ran the orphanage really ruined it for a family movie. My daughter didn't like it at all anyway so we didn't even finish it.
1 ||| A couple of t he best songs were deleted and new ones added.  The live stage version is much better.
1 ||| I don't care for musicals like this one. Kids singing voices, after awhile,  get on my nerves. This would have been better as play.
1 ||| This movie was just okay.  I thought it was a different movie,  It was a good whoops though.  I wouldn't recommend this movie
1 ||| The Bottom Line:  A quickly-put-together and unconvincing version of Krakauer's amazing book, Into Thin Air (and other movies like it, obviously) is the reason why "TV movie" is a pejorative term; rewriting real people to make heroes and villains and condensing everything into a tidy 100 minute block, Into Thin Air is depressingly bad.
1 ||| I don't know what should have tipped me off first -- that this film is made for TV or that the "bonus trailers" on the DVD are for "Cliffhanger" and "Vertical Limit."  A story as profound as Krakauer's and a mountain as big as Everest just shouldn't be forced onto the small screen.  The movie suffers greatly from the very things that mountainclimbers cannot do -- rush.  The movie pushes along at a relentless pace using fade to white as a time compression device.  The movie never takes its time until its way too late.  We can't decompress that fast!  The dialogue and acting suffer from the made-for-TV feel, and the plot comes across as something closer to one of Reader's Digests' "Drama in Real Life" instead of Krakauer's prose.  Sure there are a few emotional moments and points where they "get it right," but they are too few and far between.  The movie is so rushed we don't have time to care about the characters presented.  Ironically I thought Imax's "Everest," even with its documentary feel, was far more moving.  Of course I also did this movie a disservice by seeing it back to back with "Touching the Void" an immensely superior film.  Read Krakauer's book and watch "Void" or "Everest."  Leave this DVD back at base camp.  *1/2
1 ||| A few years ago I read the book this movie is based on and it started a fascination with the mountain and the people who sometimes die climbing it. I then discovered a movie, this movie, was made. It took some time to get a copy, and when I finally had opportunity to watch it with my girlfriend, I fell asleep (not really a comment about the movie, but the excessive hours I was working).   So now, I've watched it. And... it was clearly in trouble right off the start. In a story ABOUT how several people died on the mountain, the movie often STOPs to remind us with the narration,  that '5 people will die'. The producers obviously recognized thier inability to recreate the actual drama that happened.  I say, "Don't tell me, SHOW ME". After several scenes I was left wondering if I hadn't read the book if I would really understand what was happening.   Catch this movie on some tv channel at night. Definitely READ Jon Krakauer's book, or even listen to the audio tape or cd. Or wish someone with ability would take this story and make a good or even great movie from the story.
1 ||| This is a fair version of the Jon Krakauer book on the Everest disaster of 1996.  The characters of the climbers are much richer in the book than this film.  Of course, that's often true of any film.  However, it's the people who experienced this climb that really make the story vibrate and live.  The film takes about two steps back and puts the mountain and conditions first. It's not a terrible film and a viewer who hasn't read "Into Thin Air" or "The Climb" may find it superficially enjoyable.  But why take the time to watch this when you can see a much better view of Everest around the very time this disaster happened by viewing the IMAX film (or its video) and live the experience through one of the two books. David Breashears, one of the creators of the IMAX film has an excellent book that uses his experience with the climb and the film to study the '96 disaster.  This film takes a back seat to his book, too. Don't plan on reading any of the books? This film is a fair alternative.  But the viewer won't understand the complexities and drama of the event through this point of view.
1 ||| Into Thin Air:Death On Everest~1997 I'm afraid to say that this is a very poor movie based on a true story. If you want something along the similiar lines of this read Jon Krakauer's book or watch Vertical Limit anyway I will tell you the plot: In May 1996, writer Jon Krakauer joined a party of experienced and amatuer climbers-lead by Everest veterans Scott Fisher and New Zealander Rob Hall-who attempted to reach the world's highest and most infamous mountain. Krakauer was one of the lucky ones, he made it back alive- 12 people didn't.
1 ||| The making of this movie was quite an undertaking. Unfortunately, it never quite makes the grade. The characters are not developed. Instead, they are caricatures of those whom they purport to be.  One expedition leader, the late Scott Fischer, comes across as a mellow, disorganized, bumbling dude. One of his expedition guides, the late Anatoli Boukreev, is depicted as a self centered, Neanderthal like he-man, who clearly differs with his boss on what his role as a guide is to be.  Another expedition leader, the late Rob Hall, fares somewhat better, in that he is portrayed as an organized, stand up expedition leader, who puts the welfare of his clients above his own. His much publicized radio farewll to his pregnant wife is included as part of the drama.  Socialite Sandy Hill Pittman seems to represent conspicuous consumption and is depicted as a self-absorbed, rich bitch with little regard for the Sherpas whom she treats as little more than human yaks. Texan Beck Weathers fares little better, as he is characterized as a buffoon. I am sure that, were he to see this movie, he would wish that they'd have left him on Everest.  The actor who plays Jon Krakauer's character has the thankless role of Greek chorus. He is there to basically tie up loose ends in the movie. He portrays Krakauer as a dour, humorless human being who, were it not for the fact that he is a talented writer, would have been pushed off the Lhotse face of Everest by some enterprising soul. Last, but certainly not least, are the Sherpas, who are shown as wise, brave, put upon souls. Now here, the movie is hitting its mark.  The cinematography is laughable. Numerous shots of a mountain purporting to be Everest are easily spotted as shots of a mountain other than Everest. Since when is Everest without its signature tell tale plume, waving banner like in the sky?  Let me cut to the chase. Read the well written book upon which the movie is based, "Into Thin Air" by Jon Krakauer. Do not bother with this movie, unless, like me, you are an Everest junkie and a glutton for punishment. It is the only reason that I rated the movie with two stars instead of just one. Even so, it is still pretty much of a stinker.
1 ||| Not a fan
1 ||| Plot was ok. Parts were quite unrealistic. Lying 1 star off. Immodesty and obvious promiscuity another 2 stars off. There is more. Those out there might not see how we do, but perhaps so.
1 ||| Very annoying singing voices.  I did not enjoy this at all.
1 ||| Most Hollywood movies over the 3 decades are usually the same.  Like soap bubbles colorful, large, and shiny, but look inside and there is no content.  Preachers kids who drink, curse, smoke, and gamble.  A father who seems to be a good preacher and almost a tyrant,  A mother who seems wimpiest and crushed.  You think this has some sense of reality to it let me know.  The Hollywood environment will never produce a Shakespeare, Dickens, Solzhenitsyn, Dostoyevsky, or Tolstoy.  Hollywood is to arrogant, egotistical, or vain to be of much value. They usually make movies from books by contemporary authors with a political or social agenda of contemporary times.  Makes you question motivation. You will find movies that were made years earlier at 2 to 3 times the value in price and contextual quality.  Bollywood is the highest exporter of movies, not Hollywood.  When you look in the mirror the only one looking back at you is your own reflection.
1 ||| Review of A River Runs Through It Hot Toasty Rag, September 25, 2017  This famous movie from the 1990s follows brothers Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt as they grow up and react to their strict father, Tom Skerritt. Its a period piece, in the years after WWI, going through the Great Depression, and while the boys take their separate paths, they're always tied to each other because of family, home, and their mutual love of fly fishing.  Robert Redford directed this family drama, and as always, you can see his love for nature in every scene. Hes also the narrator in the movie, so if you think you recognize the voice in the beginning of the movie, you're right. Redford specializes in directing beautiful nature scenes and capturing emotional turmoil within a family. A River Runs Through It is very pretty to watch, but as much as I love Robert Redford, its not my favorite of his films. Dont throw anything at me, but Im not really a Brad Pitt fan, so I found myself rooting for Tom Skerrit more often than not.  Watch the preview to see if its your style. I like The Horse Whisperer better, but if you're one of the millions of people who drool over Brad Pitt, you're going to want to rent this one alongside Legend of the Falls.
1 ||| Wasn't what I was expecting.
1 ||| Boring and sentimental memories of one's formative years in Montana.  I kept waiting for something of interest but the experiences were mostly banal, and the nostalgia and philosophizing left me cold.  Is this what is considered good literature today?
1 ||| You know what I like the 1970's stuff in this movie but over all it really kind of stank.  The modeling stuff, Faye Dunaway, 1970's stuff all cool but a bad movie
1 ||| I lived back when this movie takes place.  Today's generation would have trouble understanding the agenda.  It was well done but slow moving.
1 ||| Nine Things About the Movie "Annie" (1982)  [After watching the 2014 version of "Annie" I decided tonight to go back and watch the original 1982 version again. I hadn't seen it since I was a kid, and I remember loving it when I was little. This review reflects my adult perspective on the revisiting. I realize that this review will make a lot of die-hard fans very angry with me.]  1. What did I just watch? OK, the songs are just as catchy as they were. And fine, Carol Burnett still rules.  2. But the movie itself? The movie is utterly ridiculous. And weird. And there is entirely too much dancing. Most kids today wouldn't have it.  3. I realize that this movie is based in the Depression, and is based on the original comic, which had different social standards. But I still find the movie disturbing in ways that were completely over my head when I was 11.  4. This movie is blatant capitalist propaganda. It openly worships money and power, and demonizes the poor. It even manages to make fun of communism.  5. I was horrified to now understand the context in which the song "Tomorrow" was used - to encourage the President of the United States to distract poor people from paying attention to their situation.  6. In this movie, money is always the solution, and people are essentially property.  7. Besides being classist, the movie is sexist and racist.  8. The character of Punjab is a car crash of gasp-inducing stereotypes.  9. But they all smile and sing about it, so that counts for something, I guess.
1 ||| Looking at the list of the cast - an "A" list- I was looking forward to a great movie. I was very wrong! Dunaway throughout the movie has one look: a catatonic look in her closeups, and after a few closeups of that, it gets to be tedious and repetitive. The unexpected ending is not satisfactory, and does not make sense, either. The acting of Jones is not very believable- this was one of his early movies. I guess those are some of the reasons why the movie did so poorly at the box office. Oh, one redeeming factor for the movie: A great look at the fashions, streets and New York scenes of the 70's. THAT was fun to watch!
1 ||| That's it. Didn't get all the hype. Not bad just not great at least for me. Just my opinion, you may love it! Well, there is Brad Pitt!
1 ||| sadly this was ruined by Carroll Burnett.  Do Not get me wrong she is a great personality and comedian.  But why does she get to make the bad character a good person at the end??? This shows she does not have the ability to play a wide range of personalities.  Please do not defend her by saying that is "Carroll Burnett ... people do not want to see her as the bad guy".  She is not playing herself she is playing miss Hannigan!  Plus even when this movie came out most people who watched it would not have said "Oh no she cant play a bad guy".  Heck most who watched it do not know her.  (Today most don't even know John Wayne who was more famous).  why change the story line?
1 ||| Not too good.
1 ||| What I don't like is that I mistakenly ordered a VHS format which I cannot play. Have not been motivated to replace it with a DVD.
1 ||| Sooo slow and tedious. I don't see all the hype for this one at all. Story is decent at best -- don't know what Redford was thinking; he's way better than this -- but the pace makes you want to just put a gun in your mouth.
1 ||| I was disappointed. Nothing great like the original.
1 ||| I have tried on more than one occasion to like this movie. It is beautiful to look at of course and worth seeing it just for the scenery.  But, Redford just missed the boat on directing it. It just doesn't hold the interest. The pace is so slow most of the time that you could doze off and there seem to be odd things thrown in for no particular reason. Brad Pitt was too young, with too little depth as an actor to put everything into the role that needed to be there.  He just comes across as a rather delinquent personality with no real depth.  Pretty much a tragedy looking for a place to happen from the time he was just a kid. I think the test of any movie is "does it grab you and hold you from the first scene?". This movie does not.
1 ||| beautiful nature - the movie is just ok - wouldn't recommend it - pretty boring at times - had to fast forward it.
1 ||| Really. I grew up loving Robert Redford. And his voice is about the only thing good about this film with the exception of the cinematography (and the native chick's hair). But visuals do not make a story. Please...the book is a separate issue. I can imagine if you read it, this might make a great accompaniment to the story but on its own - uh uh.  Yes, it is begging to be some sort of metaphysical contemplative puff piece on the nature of family, love, existence, blah blah blabbity blah! What this film lacks are strong characters, heroes, thoughts, ideas, a plot, and anything else worthy of the concept of "story". Is it a visual poem? Maybe. But is it good poetry? Does it show why life is worth living? No. It does show why fly fishing is worth pursuing or why Montana may indeed be a nice place to visit or that all young men should grab a hot native chick off of a reservation and get thrown in jail with her.  Legends of the Fall is infinitely better in every single aspect than this little annoyance if you're into Pitt and the whole Bad Brother routine.  You know people who love to have coffee table books around, or Marxist dialectical imperative pamphlets lying around that they pretend to read? Or Jean Luc Godard films that they pretend to understand? Well this my friends is the American equivalent. Think Antonioni but without Monica Vitti and Alain Delon. And Eclipse almost made me gouge my eyes out.  In truth, sans sarcasm, I really wanted to love this film. I did not. I will not. I cannot. As it sadly suckity suck sucks!  God bless all of you. And please, at least admire me for standing up to all who come here to echo your own praises.  Let's be honest - all the reviews here are really just buds of Redford trying to make him feel good. Or worse...Robert himself with over 250 fake accounts. Really Robert...for shame!
1 ||| To weird for me.  Didn't understand most of it.
1 ||| I admired Robin Williams but I did not like all of his shows or movies.  This movie was wacky and I just could not get into it.  It is also a little bit raunchy--I am not a prude but this was a little much.  Most of all the plot was too weird for me.
1 ||| I've seen better movies with these actors. The best part was the park scene, other than that it was slow, a guy down on his luck.
1 ||| It is an ok movie.  The problem with this movie is its too long.  The movie could have been cut by at least 45 min.  You learn about the main characters too many times - once is enough.  If you have 2 hours and 17 min to kill then watch the movie.
1 ||| My husband couldn't handle the singing...which it was a musical.
1 ||| This is one of my favorite movies, and definitely my favorite of Terry Gilliam's. That is the reason I was very disappointed in this Blu Ray release that is nothing but a straight transfer from DVD at best with no extras whatsoever. Wait for a decent release. I would give it one star, but I actually love this movie and couldn't bring myself to do it....
1 ||| Firstly, it's totally unacceptable that it's not in 2.35.1. You see more, and so you should. Secondly, it's probably one of the worst movie musicals ever made. One star for Carol Burnett, and one for Ann Reinking's all too brief dancing. I like the 'We've got Annie' dance number, even though it's completely out of the wrong period that the film is set in. The film though, in trying to blow a paper thin stage show up with a third rate score into an elephantine extravaganza, completely loses what little charm the show had. But many people love it, so I'm happy for them.
1 ||| Like the story - have seen it many times.  This one, however, I could not watch  the DVD because something was wrong with the program.  I could not get it to go beyond the notice to all viewers not to copy the film  Love the movie...but this one I could not watch.  The DVD would not let me get past the warning that most of the DVD-  I could not and won't be rating this one...I never did get to see it.  When I put the DVD into the machine, the movie played as far as the warning that is always on at the beginning....and never left it.  It flashing off it and you would think the movie is going to start now....and then it came back to the waning again.  Had to send it back.
1 ||| If I knew more about how the courts are, or were, set up in Rumpole's time, I might have enjoyed this series more. Be your own judge there.
1 ||| I bought these after hearing several good radio theater Rumpole shows. The video Rumpole character is little more than a hopless British WC Fields less the sense of humor. I'm not sure these are worth donating to the thrift store.
1 ||| If you were a kid when you first fell in love with this movie, then chances are that you're all grown up now.  And if you're all grown up now, chances are that you'll abhor this DVD release as much as I do.  The people who released this DVD apparently didn't realize that since it came out in 1982, it would have a large audience of people who fell in love with it then, but have grown up to be discerning movie buyers now.  And grown-ups need things with their DVD packages, especially if those packages claim to be "Special Anniversary Editions".  They need things like commentary.  Sure, John Huston is long dead, but what about the living?  Why not round up Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Aileen Quinn and some of the girls for a real commentary track?  Grown-ups need in-depth making-of featurette documentaries, not sappy retrospectives narrated by Aileen Quinn as if she were talking to a bunch of grade-schoolers.  And grown-ups emphatically do NOT need cheesy sing-along and act-along with Annie features, or insipid trivia that any 8th-grade graduate could do.  The worst thing of all about this DVD is the fact that it's not presented in letterboxed format.  What kind of era are we living in that we could get a movie shot in widescreen on a pan-and-scan DVD??  It almost made me cry to realize that I was missing a third of the action in most of these shots.  Had I realized that, I never, ever, would have paid for this DVD.  Let that be a lesson in always reading the packaging carefully, and never presuming for a moment that DVD manufacturers are in tune with the needs that grown-up consumers have for their movie merchandise.  I would have given this sham of a product 0 stars if I could have, but I can't bear to give so few stars to a movie I love so much.  Looks like all I can do is keep the old tunes in mind, and modify them just a little . . . "Tomorrow, tomorrow, maybe we'll get a better DVD release tomorrow -- it's only a day away!"
1 ||| If you haven't already seen this one, do not wait until "Tomorrow", do it today.  This is one of the most delightful musicals of recent years. Great performances by Aileen Quinn as Annie, Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks, Carol Burnett is outstanding as Ms Hannigan and Tim Curry & Bernadette Peters make convincing nasties. The music is great and the easy-to-miss one-liners are delightful. All-in-all, a must see, and a must-possess movie.
1 ||| DID NOT THINK KIDS LIKED IT
1 ||| A terrific, outstanding cast couldn't save this one.  Rule #1 in transferring musical to screen--never, EVER tamper with the numbers.  For some reason, the musical was completely retooled for the film, with half of  its best numbers dropped.  If you've never heard or seen the original  musical production, this version has nothing to do with the actual broadway  show.  Consequently, it's way inferior.  What made the musical great was  that it wasn't just about "Annie," but Christmas and the Great  Depression.  There's nothing about that in here, so the movie loses all the  poignancy of the original. Rule #2--to make a successful show to screen  transfer, the numbers have to be shot in a fantasy style.  Sounds corny,  but I'm telling  you--it works (See the modern version of "Pennies  From Heaven." As gritty as the storyline is, it works as a musical  precisely because the numbers are shot so unrealistically). When you shoot  a musical in a completely realistic style, no matter how good it is it will  never have the magical feel that makes musicals feel so special; the film  will just look like a regular movie with a bunch of dopes singing out of  context for no reason.  That's exactly what happens here. There's no magic  or charm in this "Annie," although the cast had enough of it. Oh,  well--what a shame--this could have been better than it was.
1 ||| Having seen the original Broadway stage production with Andrea MacArdle back in 1978,this movie version directed by John Huston is a MAJOR disappointment. The movie version should have been a wonderful expansion of  the stage original, but this was not to be. Bordering on disaster, the  movie ANNIE has little to recommend it. A former review posted here by  Carolyn says it all. The movie replaced great songs from the stage  original(NYC,etc) with horrible new ones (DUMB DOG, WE GOT ANNIE, LETS GO  TO THE MOVIES,etc). There is nothing in this film that evokes the 1930s  Great Depression era the movie takes place in (where is the HOOVERVILLE  sequence). The movie in loaded with errors in regard to time and place. For  example, if Warbucks' 5th Ave Mansion is as expansive as shown in the  movie, it would have to located in Central Park; the movie Annie attends is  CAMILLE which never played at Radio City Music Hall and premiered in 1937  (not 1933 when the movie takes place, in fact RC Music Hall opened in late  1932); in the stage version the chracters attend a performance at the ROXY  Theatre which is as it should be; the New York in the movie ANNIE is a  mixture of unconvincing Hollywood sets and poor location shots which have a  1970s look and feel(why so many modern buildings in the background). Annie  as performed by Aileen Quinn is a pint size Ethel Merman who looks strong  enough to take on an army, she exhibits little heart and comes across as a  phony. Most of the other cast members are wasted or under perform thier  roles. Which brings me to the awful finale as presented in the move; the  stage version ends at Christmas while the movie becomes a summer circus;  Miss Hannigan is carried off to jail in the original while in the movie she  is seen drunkinly riding a circus elephant. What were producer Ray Stark  and John Huston trying to do? It baffles me to this day. Watch the ABC  Disney version of ANNIE it is not as good as the stage original but much  better than this awful movie version.
1 ||| I was surprised at the language and the frequent use of the F word.  I was hoping to show this classic to my 10 year old grandkids but will not be doing that.  Now that I'm 65 having never seen the complete film I found it to less funny that the few clips they normally show.  As with most film previews in 2 minutes they can show all the funny parts of the film.
1 ||| Not interesting
1 ||| My son didn't care for this and never finished watching it.
1 ||| Annoying!! My daughter loves this movie but I hate it. It drives me nuts. The acting is terrible (even for a kid's show) and it goes on forever. Better lessons on sharing and not being greedy have been taught in less than 20 minutes but this is a full length film. All the crazy stuff going on takes away from the actual message. The songs are horrible. But my daughter loves Elmo, so she loves it. That's really all this movie has going for it.
1 ||| Ok for an Elmo movie. Lots of sarcasm in the dialogue. Not my favorite in this series
1 ||| I was expecting more and disappointed. One could sum up this movie in one sentence "tough guy wins some fights". Also, it is sort of hard to buy as Charles Bronson is old and the other fighters were just as old. I won't watch this again, in my opinion not worth watching.
1 ||| There was something wrong with the programming when this one was manufactured.  Kept repeating and never ever got to the end.  A glitch that kept on happening. Very frustrating.  Peed me off big time for an evening.
1 ||| Way too hectic for little children.  Lots of extraneous noise.  Very frantic pace.  Would not recommend.  Muppets movies much better.
1 ||| Wish a reivew had alerted me, but I should have checked the aspect ratio before purchase anyway. The movie is pan and scan other than the credits. A real rip-off. I'm not waiting to rate the movie, guess I'll do that whenever I get to SEE the whole thing. Whatever the strengths of the movie, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PRODUCT.
1 ||| HARD TIMES (1975) - (Walter Hill, dir.) With Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Jill Ireland and Strother Martin. Set in New Orleans in the early '30s, this streetboxer story is considered by many to be Bronson's best movie.  "Hard Times" is quite enjoyable but this particular edition from GOODTIMES only rates two stars because of manufacturing limitations. The brand dubbed tapes in LP mode, thus they have a degraded picture quality compared to SP transfers. Audio is linear mono instead of the far superior HiFi stereo.  For anyone who seeks a quality VHS of this work, you'll be pleased with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/1996-SONY-COLUMBIA/dp/6303257658/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">1996 SONY/COLUMBIA</a>&nbsp;version.
1 ||| grand son hated this dvd. i guess elmo is played out now.
1 ||| My son is a huge Elmo fan but this movie did not hold his attention.  After reading the reviews I just figured my son would be captivated. It now collects dust with all the other movies my son has rejected.
1 ||| Not as bad as The meaning of life, but not very funny. Just dumb.
1 ||| This movie sucked it was not funny. Some may enjoy this I didn't.
1 ||| This is good for about the first five minutes, and after that it becomes increasingly boring. The gags are too simplistic and obvious. And I like Monty Python!
1 ||| Liked the stage version so much better.  Love British humour but this was even a wee bit bizarre for them.  Did not help that the case for the dvd did come damaged as well, could return but probably will give as a gift to someone who will enjoy more than I.  I would skip this and just enjoy on youtube.
1 ||| People said this was very funny but I did not like it all that much, so maybe its just me.
1 ||| This is a classic movie that I love but I gave it two stars because the QUALITY of the video is substandard.. I would expect this from a bootleg site not from a legitimate site.  It will make me think twice about ordering another digital movie from here again.
1 ||| I've seen this movie 4 times now and ever since the first time I sit there wondering "What the heck do people think is funny in this movie" - Than I realized that if I had been high when I watched it this movie probably would have been hilarious!  That's actually a good thing because than I could have some killer food and laugh at this stuff even though usually I'd just turn it off lol
1 ||| The English comedy group Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin), is widely known for its series of humorous sketch shows, broadcast on television in the early 1970s. Much of their work was a humorous combination of the creative, farcical, and surreal, such that the group's influence on subsequent comedy was significant. In "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", they tried their hand at a feature length film that spoofed the Arthurian legends and the quest for the holy grail, with a parody of the chivalrous knights of medieval tales. Being a fan of the Arthurian legends and of parody, it was this combination that first attracted me to this film, as well as the fact that it is often regarded as one of the greatest comedy films of all time.  But does Monty Python & the Holy Grail live up to this reputation?  The influence and popularity of Monty Python is indisputable, but that does not mean that this comedy troupe has found favour from all quarters. Certainly they display the potential to come up with some extraordinarily creative and original humor, appreciated especially by those who find the surreal and absurd in any way funny.  But it is regrettable that the humor of their television shows often descends into the risque and irreverent.  Monty Python and the Holy Grail is no different in that it contains both the usual brand of Python humor, as well as a significant amount of irreverence and sexual innuendo. Some parts are funny, in fact tremendously so, for who can ever forget the defeat of the killer rabbit with Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, the three-headed Knights that say "Ni--!", the Bridge of Death with its absurd riddles, and the closing scenes where our heroic knights are conquer the grail, only to be arrested by British policemen.  But the clever humor doesn't excuse the large amounts of blasphemous material, which frequently is used as a source of humor in connection with the religious aspects of the grail. Monty Python took their irreverence even a step further in a subsequent film, Life of Brian, which is a parody of the Biblical Messiah Jesus Christ. But it's not just unholy religious humor that's problematic here - discerning viewers should realize that "the Holy Grail" also contains some risque sexual innuendo in the usual Monty Python style.  And these moral concerns aside, there are cases in "the Holy Grail" where the surreal attempts at humor just aren't funny, but stupid.  Critiquing a sacred cow is always dangerous, not least when this films is regarded one of comedy's holy grails.  But those of us who err on the side of conservatism with our moral standards will want to give this film a miss. For a more innocent parody of chivalry which avoids the unholiness and irreverence of this humor, try instead Goldman's The Princess Bride. - GODLY GADFLY
1 ||| Nothing to say about the film itself - simply a word of warning about the box set: it appears from the product listing to be simply a copy of the ordinary 2 DVD edition - which retails for less than half the price of this boxed set - with a copy of the screenplay and some cards and senitypes (whatever they are) thrown in.   The complete screenplay can be obtained from literally hundreds of places on the net - just try googling on "anarcho-syndicalist commune" and you'll see.   You do the maths. Twenty bucks for some cards?   Someone's having a laugh, and my guess is he's not part of a self-perpetuating autonomous collective.   Olly Buxton

3 ||| Whether audiences will get behind The Lightning Thief is hard to predict. Overall, it's an entertaining introduction to a promising new world -- but will the consuming shadow of Potter be too big to break free of?
1 ||| Harry Potter knockoffs don't come more transparent and slapdash than this wannabe-franchise jumpstarter directed by Chris Columbus.
3 ||| Percy Jackson isn't a great movie, but it's a good one, trotting out kernels of Greek mythology like so many Disney Channel references.
2 ||| Crammed with dragons, set-destroying fights and things exploding, [Columbus] squeezes in a few well-meaning pause breaks about friendship and absent fathers before swiftly moving on to the next pyrotechnics display.
3 ||| This action-packed fantasy adventure, based on Rick Riordan's hit Percy Jackson and the Olympians series of books, is great fun, and deserves to find an audience with teens now bereft of any Harry Potter magic.
2 ||| For what it is and for whom it is intended, it's not a bad movie, just an indifferent one.
2 ||| Chris Columbus returns to his comfort zone for this mirthless, episodic fantasy saga based on the young-reader book series by Rick Riordan.
2 ||| The best thing you can say about Chris Columbus's adaptation is that he's incapable of destroying whatever magic and wonder it is in these books that has kept kids coming back for more.
3 ||| Percy Jackson may not be "Harry Potter good," but kids will really enjoy it and parents will be happy to have a moviethey can bring them to that's family-friendly.
2 ||| Admirably, the movie isn't bogged down in the exposition common to first entries, but at the end, it's a franchise searching for its voice.
2 ||| Imperfect, yes, but also both suitably imaginative and entertaining. Works as action-adventure razzle-dazzle, coming-of-age tale, and beginners' lesson on Greek mythology.
2 ||| Although the standard allegorical bases for mythical-quest movies are dutifully covered, the obvious similarity of Percy Jackson to the Harry Potter movies inevitably makes it feel somewhat secondhand.
1 ||| A little bit worse than lifeless; it's clueless, like a Medusa running around with her head cut off.
2 ||| You don't even have to be familiar with the first book in Rick Riordan's popular fantasy series to enjoy Chris Columbus' energetic adaptation.
2 ||| This is generic filmmaking at its most banal, a simple-minded simplification of a not overwhelmingly complex book.
2 ||| Kids may well enjoy the adventures of The Lightning Thief on screen, but I think most readers will prefer the movie in their imaginations.
2 ||| An attempt to steal some of Harry Potter's thunder that also stands on its own as a well-made large-scale adventure that works well enough to entertain the teens it's hoping to strike.
3 ||| With great effects (and a few surprises) it's a fun, Saturday-matinee adventure.
2 ||| While this might not rival the later, better Harry Potter movies or the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it's more fun than you might expect.
2 ||| Percy Jackson & the Olympians sounds like an Otis Redding cover band. It is, instead, an unofficial cover of the Harry Potter franchise.
2 ||| The Lightning Thief makes the idea of a sequel seem like an inviting proposition.
2 ||| Columbus aims at nothing more than providing a rambunctious romp. He nimbly avoids the fate that has snared other film adaptations, like Eragon and Inkheart.
2 ||| gets so many things right that when it goes astray that you kind of wish it hadn't tried in the first place
2 ||| The Lightning Thief isn't electric, but it generates some spark when it varies the Grecian formula.
2 ||| Even with all its computer-generated fireballs, it's lukewarm medium-budget blockbustering.
2 ||| The disappearance of lightning simply is not interesting, and Percy Jackson and the Olympians sounds more like a '70s funk band than a kid's series.
3 ||| Uma Thurman demonstrates she can wear a snake-covered head as gracefully as Pierce Brosnan can trot around with a horse's netherlands.
2 ||| The Greek-gods premise lets the filmmakers indulge in some visually whizzy sequences that keep this rather lightweight action movie entertaining.
2 ||| Enjoyable, nicely paced family adventure with likeable characters, a strong central premise and some decent set-pieces, though the plot's a little hazy in places and the humour doesn't always work.
2 ||| The Lightning Thief is all crass ineptitude and lost potential. Columbus' infantilizing of any character depth and use of leftover Harry Potter special effects will amuse only the smallest in your pantheon.
1 ||| It raises issues it doesn't have the balls to resolve by placing them in a context it doesn't have the brains to exploit.
1 ||| Whew boy.
2 ||| My problems with it are the same as with most screen adaptations of young adult novels...they spend so much time struggling to explain the world they're creating that they forget which parts of the story people want to see...they figure that people (kids)
1 ||| Sadly worthy of its dumping into the cinematic boneyard of wintry mid-February.
2 ||| The camera work is frequently pedestrian, the acting is bland, and the jokes often fall flat.
3 ||| Director Chris Columbus has brought together the modern and mythical spheres with sharp pacing and a nifty sense of fun that atone for the film's dippier moments. It's his most enjoyable effort since Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
2 ||| Dutifully Potteresque it begins, and dutifully Potteresque it ends.
2 ||| Columbus knows his way around this kind of material even if some of the special effects look like they came from Deep Discount.
2 ||| Too scary for younger fans of the popular book.
2 ||| The pleasant surprise is how deftly the story translates the myths from their classical idiom into modern ones and without losing the classical flavor
3 ||| ...great fun for the whole family. And if it introduces you and any young readers in your home to the books, so much the better.
2 ||| Sorry Mr. Jackson, but Harry Potter you ain't.
2 ||| While winning the award for longest movie title, it is a film that only goes through the motions.
2 ||| Not without bright moments ... but the story is centered around a trio of young actors who simply aren't operating at the same skill level as their older costars.
2 ||| Harry, Ron and Hermione: Relax. You could whip Percy Jackson and his pals with your wand hands tied behind your backs.
2 ||| The film toggles between high camp and deadly earnestness, all the while threatening to drown in an ocean of not-so-special effects.
2 ||| This is a kids' movie: Parents can either get into the silly-suspenseful spirit of it or play Rummikub on their iPhones.
2 ||| All you have at the end of it is an enervating feeling of deja vu.
2 ||| Like its stars, the film is genial good company.
2 ||| It's apparent that Potter may at last have a worthy successor.
2 ||| Unfortunately, the movie lacks that good old Potter charm, trading Harry's dark whimsy for a handful of CGI magic beans.
3 ||| There are lots of cool surprises along the way, and the special effects are fantastic, especially the ones that create Uma Thurman's Medusa snakedo.
2 ||| Columbus and company have crafted an agreeable mythological jaunt the whole family will enjoy, and while I wouldn't pay more than matinee prices that still means making the quest to the multiplex is a journey worthy of the undertaking.
3 ||| Lerman has a presence even with a mouth full of bad dialogue.
1 ||| This film is replete with plot holes.
2 ||| Some moments of inspired silliness save this escapist adventure from complete dullness.
1 ||| A dull, scattershot affair that owes much to both X-Men and Greek mythology but which never seems to slow down enough to make any sense whatsoever.
3 ||| ...an agreeable fantasy adventure that should leave fans of the genre satisfied.
2 ||| Director Columbus never quite gets comfortable juggling the film's myriad characters, grandiose-but-stale CGI effects, and PG-friendly battle scenes, speeding headlong through endless plot points rather than taking the time to make any of them matter.
2 ||| "It is a bit hard to see quite where Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief's market lies. Too adult for juveniles, too juvenile for adults.
2 ||| So trite and ludicrous it is no threat to the Harry Potter franchise
1 ||| Maybe if you're aged between eight and 12, or exceptionally dim-witted, you may not notice that this is a tenth-rate rip-off of Harry Potter, with Greek mythology taking the place of magic.
3 ||| The technical wizardry is spectacular and the story is taut, pacy and consistently inventive.
3 ||| The film is a rousing blend of special effects, but not so scary that children aged seven and above will spend the entire movie hiding behind their fingers.
2 ||| Chris Columbus was a safe choice behind the lens, and he doesn't throw up any surprises. Columbus brings a measured approach that works on the whole, delivering the expected mix of set-ups, set-pieces and edge of your seat showdowns.
3 ||| An imaginative, if simplistic, visit to classical Greek mythology, an archetypal quest by a lad with paternal issues.
2 ||| It's not enough to compensate for the computer-game-style plotting, which is largely based on us picking up narrative nuggets that mechanically slot into place later on.
2 ||| Kids will love it, and adults may relish Pierce Brosnan's Centaur, and Steve Coogan as Hades - in his personal hell just under Hollywood.
1 ||| A slab of market research in search of an actual movie.
3 ||| Percy Jackson manages to make Greek mythology both fun and exciting and is sure to appeal to its key demographic.
2 ||| Not bad, but JK Rowling can rest easy.
2 ||| There's plenty of larks to be had from a fast-moving fantasy that doesn't take its mythology too seriously and employs actors who don't look like teenage rabbits in headlights.
2 ||| While you suspect it's really just a big Clash Of The Titans spoiler, there's enough action in Jackson to make it succeed on its own terms. Lerman's a likeable lead, though it's the game supporting cast that keeps you watching.
2 ||| It's evidently Potter-ish, but unashamedly aimed at younger viewers - which makes the emphasis on the junior hero's fighting skills and a clearly misguided Las Vegas casino sequence all the more dismaying.
2 ||| It is great to see Greek Mythology taking centre stage, even if people must say "no way", "yes way" when faced with a fire-breathing hydra.
2 ||| Digitisation reigns - spectacular visual effects - while the dialogue drizzles and sploshes.
1 ||| If they'd played it for laughs it might just have worked, but in fact its earnest tone and digimation effects stick pretty close to the Potter model. We could be in for a very long haul.
2 ||| Very American, very crass and very underwhelming.
2 ||| The story is told in bland, episodic fashion with no sense of drama or threat.
1 ||| This ineffably wooden Chris Columbus adaptation of author Rick Riordan's best-seller for young teens has a screenplay that defies description.
3 ||| It's fantastic fun, it knows its Greek mythology, and it's a very promising start to a franchise. More of the same, please.
3 ||| Remember the first time you saw Harry Potter on the big screen? This is more like the third time you saw him but with bigger effects and Greek mythology replacing the occult.
3 ||| A fun, effects-filled, escapist adventure, with several clever notions: Medusa sells garden statuary as a cover, and the Parthenon in Nashville is home to a hydra.
2 ||| A safe, bland, test-marketed product made for tween mass consumption. Like most films arriving with ampersands and colons in the title, it's a bore.
3 ||| It's all jolly good fun, rattling along at a perfect pace with enough action setpieces and spectacle to keep both youngsters and adults happy.
3 ||| What surprised me is that I had some affection for an action adventure film the way I would have in the days of the Ray Harryhausen's best films.
2 ||| While this flick may not have Harry Potter's complex world and multiple layers, it also doesn't have the angst and darkness. It replaces them with one thing in bulk: Fun.
2 ||| ... a sprightly Harry Potter clone and an eye-candy-coated intro to Greek mythology.
2 ||| click to read full review
2 ||| Of all the would-be Potter projects that have hit the screen over the years, this is one of more polished and enjoyable ones.
3 ||| A great family film, with just the right measures of action, mythological allusions, humor, and adventure.
3 ||| Not a perfect film, but the movie does have a certain passion that a lot of other franchise attempts have lacked. If you like Greek mythology and are looking for an antidote to Clash of the Titans, this may be what you're looking for.
2 ||| Mildly diverting.
2 ||| Just another mediocre fantasy flick, but if you enjoyed the books, I'm sure you'll enjoy the film.
2 ||| An enjoyable PG-rated family adventure in its own right, but Columbus' film can't live up to the Potter gold standard, and it strays enough from Riordan's source material to make its tween readership blow a gasket every few minutes. [Blu-ray]
2 ||| Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief proves to be a satisfying beginning to what is sure to be a promising film franchise.
2 ||| Manages to pay its respects to the Greek myths and actually convey them as fun.
2 ||| It kind of just builds up to a lot of Not Much.
2 ||| Percy Jackson is simply uninspired in every single meaning of the word. It's probably the crassest, most obviously derivative work of this sort since Eragon.
3 ||| It provides a great adventure movie for the family audience.
2 ||| The plot uses the presence of the Greek gods as an indistinct outline to influence teenagers who are more interested in the prestige and glamor of their connection than the responsibility that comes with it.
3 ||| As a former middle school teacher of gifted literature, I value all fairly well-made films for children and parents and this one is in that league.
2 ||| OK, but only just.
2 ||| There's nothing resembling a spark in this film anywhere.
3 ||| Holofcener always gives us more to chew on than originally meets the eye in her films and she writes female characters with an intelligence, sensitivity and realism that blows the Sex and the City foursome away any day of the week.
2 ||| The tone is low-key but very funny. Yet, at the same time, the film also manages to have a sardonic edge.
3 ||| Of a piece with Nicole Holofcener's three other films -- talky, urbane ensemble flicks that elicit quiet but deeply sincere smiles and laughs, and just as often showcase hushed moments of pinprick vulnerability.
3 ||| It's a tricky kind of social satire, its possibly cloying self-absorption cut only by some winningly awkward characters.
1 ||| Ah, the guilt of the privileged.
4 ||| One of the best movies ever about guilt as the guardian of our goodness and a sign of our yearning to belong to the larger world.
2 ||| [Holofcener] has real sympathy -- characters that might have been brittle, mockable creations in another writer-director's hands gain resonance here.
3 ||| Such fine-tuned observation requires the ideal interpreter. Keener has always been Holofcener's muse, and once again offers the sort of fully crafted portrait that reminds us how shallow most movies really are.
3 ||| With her new film, the poignant and funny Please Give, Holofcener is at the top of her game.
3 ||| Listening to the banter in Please Give feels like eavesdropping on natural conversations, shaped and selected by a skilled storyteller.
3 ||| Keener, Peet, and Hall are so strong, so empathetic even at their weakes
4 ||| One of the best movies of the year so far. An insightful, darkly funny and multi-layered character study about class and family.
2 ||| Few American filmmakers create female characters as realistically funny, attractively imperfect and flat-out annoying as does Ms. Holofcener.
2 ||| Two possible ways of regarding Please Give: It's shallow. Or maybe it's deeply shallow.
2 ||| Fleetingly amusing, charming and harmless with a terrific cast, but often meanders, lacks bite, and unevenly juggles comedy, drama and romance.
4 ||| Funny and heartbreaking.
4 ||| Please Give is a moral comedy that feels at times like one of the late Eric Rohmer's deceptively breezy miniatures, or a mid-period Woody Allen movie - the fussiness.
4 ||| Holofcener explores the contemporary female experience with a camera that is at once empathetic and merciless.
4 ||| The movie is about imperfect characters in a difficult world, who mostly do the best they can under the circumstances, but not always. Do you realize what a revolutionary approach that is for a movie these days?
3 ||| It's a wonderful movie full of people you wish you knew in real life, and like most of Holofcener's movies, it's a remarkable combination of comedy and tragedy.
3 ||| Please Give is a series of such set-piece scenes, a breezy, though not negligible, exploration of the contest between avarice and empathy.
3 ||| Please Give proves that a film can be a spectacularly rewarding experience by just providing time spent with well-written, believable adult characters.
3 ||| It recognizes that a film about unpleasant people need not be unpleasant itself as long as it remembers not to make them uninteresting as well.
3 ||| As she has in four previous films, Holofcener smartly relies on Keener's talent to create a layered character who is neurotic and often inappropriate, but still good at her core.
2 ||| Far from challenging, the film consoles the complacent, saying basically that you can do whatever you want, so long as you feel (or pretend to feel) a little guilty about it.
2 ||| Yet another ramble through the tiny world of the affluent and the idle, a particular fascination of Holofcener's. The only difference this time is the increased emphasis on morbidity.
4 ||| The combination of good-nature and light snark [make] Please Give maybe the strongest film of Holofcener's career.
3 ||| Some filmmakers make movies that hold up a mirror to nature. Nicole Holofcener makes seriocomedies that hold up a magnifying glass to human nature.
3 ||| The film's premise yields a story that's insightful and engaging while touching on many other matters of love and money.
4 ||| There's no movie around right now with a subject more pertinent. It'll hit you hard.
4 ||| Please Give is one of those movies that can be enjoyed simply for its funny portraits of human foibles and fumbling grasps at intimacy -- but it's also deceivingly profound.
4 ||| It's a movie about guilt and family and what we mean when we say something is valuable, all of which are great subjects.
4 ||| Nicole Holofcener is frequently lauded for writing vivid female characters, but such praise doesn't really do justice to her full game.
3 ||| Touching, intelligent and full of charm and wit.
4 ||| Please Give is an almost perfectly rendered slice of life, buoyant with wonderful performances.
3 ||| While the characters contend with their precarious self-images, we can't help but reflect on ourselves as well. To borrow a cautionary phrase about that mirror: 'Objects may appear closer than they are.'
4 ||| A tremendous leap forward for filmmaker Nicole Holofcener...
3 ||| [The script is] sharp and witty, but never forced, and features some of the best pure dialogue you'll hear this year.
3 ||| In Please Give, Keener is at her best. Let's hope her creative partnership with Holofcener continues.
4 ||| While Please Give is a film about conscience, it's also slyly funny, with piercing moments of insight and warmth.
4 ||| In a Holofcener film, the usual rules of screenwriting do not apply, which lends her work a lifelike quality that's particularly refreshing in this era of formulaic remakes and sequels.
3 ||| Exploring class, generations and misbehaving bodies, Holofcener's dramedy refines its character studies with warmth and wit as she creates warts-and-all individuals whose flawed humanity we warm to.
3 ||| An indie with real pedigree and smarts, Holofcener's comedy of manners is well-observered and well worth watching.
3 ||| Maybe things get worse, but movies like this at least make it easier to handle.
3 ||| There's the rare occasion where the boldness of the dialogue is laid on a little thick and it drags you out of the moment, but it doesn't happen often, and the odd excess is more than forgiveable given just how well the rest of the film works.
2 ||| Trifles, trivialities, frippery and froth. We've got plenty of words to describe things that don't matter. And now, we also have a film. Please Give.
3 ||| Beautifully played and sharply-written, the pleasures on offer here are apparently throwaway but the authenticity of the characters freights the story with a light-hearted realism.
2 ||| Holofcener's biggest ally against nauseating self-pity is Keener, her screen alter ego.
3 ||| Smart and touching, this is a must for lovers of human drama.
3 ||| Enjoyable, emotionally engaging comedy-drama from writer-director Nicole Holofcener, featuring a sharply written script, likeable characters and terrific performances from a talented ensemble cast.
3 ||| Funny yet emotional, tragic yet full of hope, this is the type of character-driven story theatergoers could use to see more of, and as like as Holofcener is around here's hope more is exactly what it is we are going to get.
3 ||| Comes close to justifying the praise it has received -- close, but not entirely.
3 ||| Nothing earth-shaking goes on here, and Holofcener has the good sense not to make her issues seem all that important. This is a lightweight comedy about mostly likable people who are a bit too wrapped up in self-analysis.
2 ||| Director/writer Nicole Holofcener goes back east for Please Give. It is an auspicious move.
3 ||| Compare these wonderfully flawed, beautifully insecure and wholly believable characters with the preprogrammed mannequins seen in such chowderheaded efforts as, say, The Back-Up Plan or Killers, and the contrast is startling.
2 ||| Real joys and sorrows must be bigger and deeper than this.
3 ||| It ends with this exchange: 'Thank You.' 'You're welcome.' How often do those simple words carry weight in a movie? At that moment, I loved those characters, and I loved this movie.
2 ||| an Upper East Side slice of navel gazing
4 ||| Nicole Holofcener's lovely Please Give is a small, modest movie, full of the sort of characters we might know, or be.
3 ||| If you're hoping for huge dramatic payoff or more than mild laughs from cynically satisfying script, then you're panhandling without a Styrofoam cup.
2 ||| This plot less movie lacks any momentum and you get no feeling of empathy or sympathy for any of the characters. The ensemble acting is sound with Guilbert standing out with a nostalgic trip down memory lane for viewers.
4 ||| Nicole Holofcener creates open-ended characters whose ordinary lives are so fascinating that when the credits roll you're wondering why Transformers gets a sequel and not them.
4 ||| In both Please Give and Friends with Money, she wrestles with our all-to-human desire for nice things but judiciously avoids ridiculing her characters for sharing a longing that is as universal as it is regrettable.
3 ||| As Holofcener charts the telling little developments in these randomly connected lives the film offers wry smiles, smart repartee, mild whimsy and some plaintive, poignant moments.
3 ||| A spiky, sophisticated, grown-up comedy...
3 ||| Touching: that's what makes Holofcener's films so lovely. They are beady-eyed satires, sure, but they're also fundamentally kind-hearted.
3 ||| This is a small film, which, if you're open to it, will draw you into the lives of people you quickly forget are fictional.
3 ||| It sparks laughter by crossing the wires of human motivation, letting you see the hazards that exist in trying to be a good person.
3 ||| Writer-director Holofcener cleverly keeps the emotions gurgling right under the surface of this engaging interpersonal comedy. It's more about smiles than laughing out loud, but the superior cast members get terrific characters to play with.
3 ||| A well-written, well-acted dramatic comedy that is light on plot but generous in spirit.
3 ||| It is well-observed but morally stunted, in that it suggests that charity is just another form of self-medication
4 ||| Holofcener writes, and helps to shape on-screen, characters we often don't even like, and what do we do? We invite them home with us. Talk about a soft touch.
3 ||| A stroll with these characters is a refreshing break from from the usual film exercises.
3 ||| Writer-director Nicole Holofcener seems to get better with every film, and now she's cruising along the well-trodden path of neurotic New Yorker comedy-drama with grace and comely confidence.
3 ||| Nicole Holofcener, who writes the most interesting female characters in the movies, delivers another dazzling role to her muse, Catherine Keener, in Please Give, a delightfully dry dramedy about guilt.
2 ||| The acting quality is strong, especially from the ever-reliable Catherine Keener as Kate, but it's almost impossible to care about her character's dilemmas.
4 ||| The film lives at that uneasy intersection between affluence and compassion, where the well-meaning well-to-do try to figure out how much of their wealth they need to give away to make a difference.
2 ||| The film is more emotionally incisive than it initially appears to be, but equally it ties together a little too neatly when it already has such a concise running time.
3 ||| Doesn't have much plot, just characters interacting and developing, and its lack of a need for drama is refreshing.
3 ||| You have to be smart and funny and really aware of yourself to write and direct a film like this, which is exactly what director Nicole Holofcener is.
3 ||| In writer/director Nicole Holofcener's crisp, poignant and funny new movie, Kipling's "white man's burden" has evolved into the liberal woman's guilt.
4 ||| About the people who give, the people who don't give and how we finally manage to connect with one another.
3 ||| Obvious but entertaining portrayal of midlife crisis gone horribly awry.
2 ||| Highly over-rated Dudley Moore comedy.
1 ||| And oh, the irony, that the film only deserves a '1.'
2 ||| It was a big hit. I have never understood why.
1 ||| Sexist, juvenile, and pathetically structured, despite the gamest efforts of its actors and the blithe willingness of its famous non-actor.
3 ||| People tend to forget what a hilarious movie this really is
4 ||| Blake Edwards's 10 is perhaps the first comedy about terminal yearning. Like all great comedies, it deals with emotions very close to our hearts.
2 ||| Dudley Moore is periodically funny, Julie Andrews is mostly charming, and Bo Derek is always gorgeous.
2 ||| 10's tossed-off quality keeps it from greatness, but it also distinguishes it from the great mass of contemporary comedies smoothed to a shiny, edgeless formula. [Blu-ray]
3 ||| A fascinating character study, bittersweet and insightful yet full of tremendous laughs.
2 ||| It has some gags - some are even quite funny - but not nearly enough.
4 ||| In a time of bloated when special effects have become the real stars, going back to a classic like this can remind viewers what movie making is supposed to be about -- acting.
4 ||| Completely deserved its high status of undisputed classic.
4 ||| While the composition of juries might change over time, the issues and attitudes that are explored here are timeless, as is this classic film.
3 ||| Cinema heresy that worked.
4 ||| Pure dynamite in movie form.
4 ||| This is a film where tension comes from personality conflict, dialogue and body language, not action.
3 ||| Sidney Lumet's debut feels a bit stagy but is never short on tension.
4 ||| An intense concentration of power, and my all-time favourite film.
4 ||| Although it may sound ungallant, these 12 Angry Men, are all right without distaff glamour. Their dramas are powerful and provocative enough to keep a viewer spellbound.
4 ||| One-room dramas don't get much better than this
4 ||| Ainda que se passe em um nico ambiente, esta obra-prima possui um alcance emocional imensurvel - e  incrvel que tenha sido o primeiro longa-metragem de Lumet.
3 ||| This film is a great combination of an adult theme and the treatment suitable for younger audience.
4 ||| A masterful work of debate and dialogue; of shifting momentum and the ideal of sticking to your scruples in the face of antagonistic groupthink.
4 ||| Power house jury room drama w/cast of memorable actors.
4 ||| Every bit the classic it's been made out to be for all these years.
3 ||| taut, well-crafted sociological study
3 ||| A brilliant courtroom drama whose strength lies within the power of Rose's words and Sidney Lumet's great direction (his debut).
4 ||| Outstanding Henry Fonda jury classic.
4 ||| an incisive and gripping film
4 ||| This was Sidney Lumet's first movie and it's as riveting as it was back in the late 50s, when everything was changing.
4 ||| The film takes a confined, almost completely banal real-world location and makes it completely dynamic, using incredibly nimble camera movements to establish character motivation and theme.
4 ||| Too few films take on the art of arguing as a subject; we could certainly use more of them, but until then, Lumet's window into strained civic duty will continue to serve mightily.
3 ||| There is real value is how it allows each member of the cultural mosaic of a jury to develop into distinct, damaged, and interesting characters
3 ||| ...the film has aged surprisingly well in the years since its 1957 release.
4 ||| In the 60 years since its release, Sidney Lumet's masterpiece has lost none of its impact. In this age of unreason, 12 Angry Men remains sorely and urgently contemporary.
4 ||| "12 Angry Men" puts the full range of human good and evil on display. It posits that, ultimately, the universe is benevolent, and our job, regarding each other, is to attempt with our best effort and greatest compassion to elucidate and clarify the truth.
4 ||| Thought-provoking, continually riveting, and absolutely unforgettable - and surprisingly designed around a very simple, tightly budgeted, special-effects-free premise.
4 ||| Reginald Rose's script is one of deep revelation.
3 ||| [The] embodiment of Disney at his best -- family entertainment that superbly uses brand-new wonders of film technology.
4 ||| One of Disney's finest live-action family-flick adventures.
3 ||| better than the ride at Disney!
2 ||| Squid battle aside, though, 20,000 Leagues doesn't give us much more pioneering footage, and that doesn't take place until the very end. The rest of the film -- in retrospect -- is just waiting for the finale.
3 ||| ...a vision of beauty and excitement for the eye and ear. It's still fun to watch after all these years.
3 ||| As fabulous and fantastic as anything he has ever done in cartoons is Walt Disney's 'live action' movie made from Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.
4 ||| This is one of Disney's best, and one of the all-time adventure greats. And that, I swear by my tattoo.
4 ||| One of the best Disney live action films and a classic fantasy-adventure.
4 ||| A breathtaking piece of entertainment, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is amongst the finest live-action films to come out of Disney Studios.
3 ||| James Mason's portrayal of Captain Nemo is a hard-edged, dramatic performance, with no winking nods or cartoonish layers. You could transport Mason whole into a much darker movie with R-rated violence, and he would fit like a glove.
3 ||| A classic action-adventure for older kids.
2 ||| Bring on the David Fincher-helmed remake.
1 ||| A tedious bore in which grubby people stand around muttering in a variety of badly chosen accents.
1 ||| The kind of movie that people will discover new and hilarious ways to mock for years to come.
2 ||| I have to give Emmerich credit for creating a film that's been funnier than '27 Dresses' or 'Over Her Dead Body.'
2 ||| about as slow and lumbering as a wounded manuk.
1 ||| In an age where ... audiences reward blood-and-thunder films ... at the box office, greenlighting 10,000 B.C. must have seemed logical. I can imagine someone pitching the film ...by saying "It's like 300 .... + 9,700!"
2 ||| Roland Emmerich is partial to cutting-edge special effects and stone-age storytelling, meaning that 10,000 B.C., a dim-witted CG extravaganza set in prehistoric times, is something like his ideal project.
1 ||| An atrocious waste of a perfectly good CGI budget ... at least the Geico commercials make an effort to get the historical accuracy right
1 ||| It's best not to think too hard about anything in 10,000 BC, a sublimely dunderheaded excursion into human prehistory.
1 ||| While the movie is completely ridiculous, at least it's fun to think of all the high school students who are going to mistake this movie for an accurate historical record and get F's on their next pop quiz.
1 ||| An epic adventure of such towering testosterone counts and ceaseless tedium, you can almost feel the hair growing on your chest as the bags collect beneath your eyes.
2 ||| Worst of all, no one even gets eaten by the disappointingly tame saber-toothed tiger.
3 ||| Sometimes you have a hankering for a slab of 10,000-year-old cheese. Here it is, on a cracker.
1 ||| May indeed last until the end of time, kept alive in drinking games and in history and geography classrooms on April Fool's Day.
2 ||| I can't figure out exactly when the film 10,000 B.C. is set, but it's definitely ancient times. Like before they had cars, guns or tabloid blogs. And definitely before they had cohesive plots or dialogue that made sense.
2 ||| While there's an attempt to make this a personal story, it's really about what we thought it would be: Incredible vistas populated with a combination of ancient temples, pyramids, woolly mammoths and a cast of (CGI) thousands.
2 ||| Too dumb to take seriously, but just silly enough to be sort of fun.
1 ||| This much-delayed film cries out for consideration for Worst CGI, Most Annoying Narrator, Lamest Dialogue and Dumbest Action Hero.
2 ||| Even a cameo by Pauly Shore in Encino Man would liven up this bombastic bore.
2 ||| 10,000 B.C. is a movie of woolly mammoths and fuzzy thinking.
1 ||| The best acting comes from woolly mammoths, man-eating ostriches and a saber-toothed tiger -- and those babies are digital. It's the human actors who look fake.
2 ||| 10,000 B.C. isn't only brain-dead, it's completely dead. It's inert and without a heartbeat.
2 ||| Where's Raquel Welch in that fur bikini?
1 ||| Yabba-dabba-don't.
1 ||| While the special effects are top notch... the humans are dull, the dialogue is ridiculous, and anyone expecting a repeat of the action in 300 is going to be sorely disappointed with this bloodless PG-13 adventure.
1 ||| The less said about historical accuracy, the better.
2 ||| The characters may speak English, but the narrative is gibberish.
2 ||| Outrageous and outlandish, Emmerich's 10,000 BC is easy to mock, but it is so cheerfully shameless and terminally silly that you have to admire its effrontery and accept its creator... as a certified crackpot visionary.
2 ||| Hey, CG mammoths! And lots of 'em! And some raptor/dodo thingies that move exactly like Spielberg's dinosaurs. Still, looks cool enough. Could've used some more of the saber-toothed tiger, though.
0 ||| A strong camp sensibility is just about the only thing that might have saved this lumbering beast.
1 ||| 10,000 B.C. is a true disaster on every level, a derivative and sometimes incomprehensible mess.
1 ||| The mammoths are cool. The squealing killer ostriches, perhaps inspired by ancient phorusrhacid fossils, are idiotic but... okay, they're idiotic.
2 ||| If you thought 300 was silly, think of 10,000 BC as 33.333 times sillier.
1 ||| [I] saith to you that I had a strangely good time, and whether that is from laughing at 10,000 B.C. or laughing with it I knoweth not, although I strongly suspect the former.
2 ||| There have been funny movies about prehistoric times ... but for real gut-busting laughs, it's hard to top the ridiculousness of 10,000 B.C.
2 ||| Too much of 10,000 BC seems to be sampled from other movies that preceded it
2 ||| It promises spectacle and action but fails to deliver all that much of either, and ends up being so dull it can't even be enjoyed for its camp value.
2 ||| Our favorite Teutonic huckster presumes that prehistory means that anything narrative goes: hey, who can prove him wrong?
2 ||| 10,000 B.C. takes a prehistoric approach to storytelling.
1 ||| This may well be the first prehistoric epic in which the liberal deployment of such words as "oog," "agh" and "uck" would have actually improved the screenplay considerably.
2 ||| As a series of set pieces looking for any available fable to keep it afloat, 10,000 BC is really nothing more than computing power and implausibility.
1 ||| Director Roland Emmerich is the ultimate spectacle over substance filmmaker. He actually makes Michael Bay look like Stanley Kubrick by comparison.
2 ||| ...it's laughably bad, which means that if you can approach it as a really stupid film you just might find yourself enjoying it.
2 ||| The film proves to be uncharacteristically restrained.
2 ||| Would that Emmerich took as much care with his human characters as with inanimate objects and CGI animals.
1 ||| This is just stupidly lazy storytelling, nothing more (and certainly nothing less), and I'd tell the director to be ashamed of himself but I'm pretty darn positive he didn't even notice he did anything wrong.
2 ||| While admittedly formulaic and banal, it's also a guilty pleasure for those who enjoy watching stampeding herds of woolly mammoths.
1 ||| 10,000 B.C. is a load of crap dressed up with pretty background vistas. The film is terminally lifeless, something that a so-called 'event' picture should never be.
2 ||| On a Neanderthal level, "10,000 B.C." works.
1 ||| One of the stupidest and most boring films of the year.
1 ||| Visually, historically and creatively, this film dishonors the year 10,000 B.C.
2 ||| 'A sweeping odyssey into a mythical age of prophesies and gods,' according to the press notes; it's also a sweeping odyssey into a mythical age in which snow is referred to even by Ice Age veterans as 'the great white rain'...
1 ||| Making prehistoric people talk and behave just like modern people in a 10,000 B.C. setting makes actors look silly. Their costumes are silly, the settings are silly, and the whole movie is unintentionally funny.
2 ||| If Mel Gibson remade Apocalypto and cast it with the Geico cavemen, he might end up with something akin to 10,000 B.C..
2 ||| Just barely good enough to fulfill the needs of an audience starved for any sort of effects-driven film that hardly sticks in the brain for more than a few minutes after it's over.
2 ||| Good special effects are expensive, so the filmmakers are forced to use unimpressive actors to fill in the spaces between the CGI creations.
1 ||| Sets new standards for stupidity. This is like Uwe Boll with a budget. This is the village idiot of movies.
1 ||| This year's first Event Movie is almost guaranteed to wind up as its dumbest.
2 ||| Strait has to be one of the most unsympathetic cardboard heroes of the genre, while Bell leaves little reason to care for her beyond her bitching dreadlocks...
2 ||| Director Roland Emmerich has swapped disaster movies like The Day After Tomorrow and Godzilla for, well, a disaster of a movie.
2 ||| Even though there's never a hint of either research or gritty realism, it's still good fun.
2 ||| Roland Emmerich's great big CGI blockbuster lumbers along like one of the woolly mammoths that roam across the screen.
2 ||| Don't expect Roland Emmerich's 10,000BC to make much sense, historically, geographically or logically.
1 ||| In what might be a record, the makers of this prehistoric drama spent two years and 20m fine-tuning the special effects to ensure its cast of mammoths, sabre-toothed tigers and maneating birds looked as realistic as possible.
2 ||| Should have been a lot more fun.
2 ||| Roland Emmerich loves to make big, dumb movies, and though this may not be his biggest, it's certainly his dumbest.
2 ||| Take the kids along; unless you want them to grow up to be palaeontologists.
1 ||| A beggar's banquet of milky CGI beasties and clunky battle-porn set-pieces, 10,000 B.C. is an extravagant waste of time, money and effort. Fans of caveman antics may want to go with something more historically accurate. Like The Flintstones.
1 ||| Like the lumbering mammoths, it is plodding and dull.
1 ||| With too much talk, not enough adventure and a laughable disregard for geography and anthropology, 10,000 BC is less Jurassic Park than Pleistocene parp.
2 ||| The mammoths aren't all that is wild and woolly in this innocent, old-fashioned, amusingly self-important, entertainingly mad, rip-snorting throwback to vintage Saturday matinee fare.
2 ||| strictly a popcorn flick version of Joseph Campell's hero's journey that looks great even as it plays fast and very loose with geography, biology, and anything else that gets in its way
2 ||| A blind man is brought up on a slab from beneath the earth, where he has spent years cooped up in cramped quarters with nothing to keep him entertained. After spending two hours in a darkened theater watching 10,000 B.C., I could relate.
0 ||| You actually have to feel sorry for the actors, one of which is New Zealander Cliff Curtis, the only person I recognised.
2 ||| it is hard to be enthralled with the dusty, warmed-over romantic fixations of what is essentially a very handsome cave-couple
2 ||| I enjoyed the movie, so it qualifies as a mammoth guilty pleasure
0 ||| It's a film that countryman Uwe Boll would have made had he the budget and the cinematographer
1 ||| The actors speak in fluent anachronistic English. The dialogue is prehistoric but not in the way Emmerich intended.
0 ||| crap, and more crap in a crap bucket
0 ||| One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
1 ||| ena matso kakomoirides sernontai stin ammo kai ton ilio, s' ena ftino, proheiro, afeles kai kakogoysto deigma karampinatis gerontikis anoias toy Emmerich
0 ||| The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing this movie to enter a movie theatre. It was like a bad made for TV special that you would see on ABC or NBC.
1 ||| In fact, while sitting through this banal attempt at a big-scale epic, I could not help but go through a checklist in my mind of all the movies "10,000 B.C." borrows from.
1 ||| But the folks who made 10,000 B.C. have filled their film with a sub-Disney plot and inserted a few measly slivers of action that hardly warrant all the mystical hubbub and romantic angst.
2 ||| ...most of the film is simply a matter of waiting for it to end.
0 ||| A disaster that can't even get the computer generated images right.
2 ||| Would make a good drinking game; silly fun but not "good." A critic sitting near me snorted in derision at my "the costumes kicked ass," but I won't back down. They were really cool.
2 ||| People expecting a fun action movie will be severely disappointed. If you get drunk with some buddies and go to make fun of it, you might like it more. But that doesn't make it a good movie
1 ||| Brace yourself for a mammoth disappointment.
1 ||| 10,000 BC takes film making back to the stone age...
1 ||| Violent, poorly conceived prehistoric action.
0 ||| Some backgrounds look as though Roland Emmerich and crew broke into a museum after hours and filmed in dioramas. Rather than a disaster film, this was just plain disaster - a departure from Emmerich's usually effective milieu and his most moronic movie.
2 ||| One of the biggest problems with the film is the casting.
2 ||| All [Emmerich] cares about is not being boring. On that level, he succeeds.
2 ||| A lousier adventure movie you won't find this year: 10,000 B.C. belongs, if not back in the stone age, then at least back in the mid '90s, where this sort of mindless, effects-driven drivel is best left.
2 ||| A prehistoric train wreck.
2 ||| A remarkably beautiful yet soulless film.
4 ||| If you haven't seen it, do.
4 ||| For those who love a grand spy mystery, a wild chase, and a harrowing portrait of an innocent man struggling to prove his innocence while the world turns inexplicably against him, The 39 Steps is ideal.
4 ||| It's almost cleansing to see a film like this which doesn't insult your intelligence.
4 ||| The "innocent man" notion has been copied and recopied for decades, but few have the minerals to stand with this one.
4 ||| A brilliant piece of pure -- and purely enjoyable -- filmmaking.
2 ||| As dull as anything Hitchcock has done, save the exhilerating final 10 minutes.
4 ||| Wonderful early sound, quite British Hitchcock thriller
3 ||| O excesso de coincidncias leva o roteiro a soar maniquesta (bem como a "tenso sexual" entre Donat e Carroll), mas a direo de Hitchcock, como sempre, salva o filme.
3 ||| Brilliant early Hitch
4 ||| All the fun of North By Northwest in a little over half the time, The 39 Steps is -- even for the umpteenth viewing -- absolutely unmissable.
4 ||| Hitchcock at his very best.
3 ||| Far more substance than other thrillers.
4 ||| an indelibly fun movie, one of Hitchcock's early triumphs of sheer enjoyment
4 ||| The 39 Steps is sexy, exciting, unexpectedly moving (thanks to Peggy Ashcroft's portrayal of a lonely woman married to a brutish farmer), and wholly unpredictable, with an ending that nicely loops back to the start.
4 ||| Classic Hitchcock suspense, some drinking and smoking.
4 ||| At its most breathtaking when both Hitchcock and his characters fully embrace the surreality of the story
3 ||| Surprisingly fast-paced for a 1935 film, full of twists and turns, and when the unlikely couple becomes handcuffed together and are forced to pretend they are married, it really kicks into high gear. Donat and Carroll have chemistry to burn.
4 ||| Alfred Hitchcock brings John Buchan's novel to the screen with characteristic wit and verve.
4 ||| The scene in which Mr Memory is asked at the London Palladium "What are the 39 Steps?" remains one of 20th-century cinema's most gripping moments.
2 ||| The lack of chemistry between Donat and Carroll's respective characters only compounds the hands-off feel...
4 ||| The 39 Steps is light, urbane, sexy as hell, and as so much of Hitchcock was so often, right about everything.
3 ||| Made in England 1935, 'The 39 Steps' isn't the first Hitchcock film constructed around "the wrong man" conceit, but it's one where he found his touch.
4 ||| A noteworthy example of Hitchcock's early thrillers, riddled with plotting, backstabbing, clever twists, and the big reveal of the meaning behind the title.
4 ||| Fine Daves, Ford collaborative western
3 ||| A taut Western (obviously inspired by High Noon) about a lone man bravely standing on principle when all others have abandoned him. Marred only by a phony ending.
3 ||| This is a first-rate action picture -- a respectable second section to High Noon.
3 ||| During the 1950s, the Western grew a conscience.
3 ||| An enjoyable western that's an excellent reminder of how - in the world of movies - sometimes less is best.
4 ||| The new 3:10 to Yuma will have to be quite a film to stand up to the original.
3 ||| A sturdy genre piece.
4 ||| The minutes tick toward 3:10, and all we can do is watch and hope that it all turns out ok. That's the best kind of Western, one that allows feelings like that to emerge while watching.
3 ||| A portrait of storytelling made for and by the Silent Generation, an audience all too familiar with the world's spooky, white-knuckled moral twilight.
3 ||| Daves isn't interested in cynicism. Redemption is probably too big a stretch as well, but there's plenty of room in-between.
4 ||| Distinguished by its thoughtfulness regarding the nature of Western heroism, as defined not only by dead-eye gunplay, but by family, community, and moral rectitude. [Criterion Blu-ray]
4 ||| Like The Gunfighter and Winchester '73, 3:10 to Yuma is one of those defining '50s Westerns that is well-known by film buffs but has never reached the familiarity level of a High Noon or Shane.
3 ||| It is hard to imagine a better Ben Wade than Glenn Ford.
3 ||| Mind games replace gunplay to the point that, while the film's running time doesn't outstay its welcome, those expecting a nonstop shootout extravaganza may leave unsatisfied.
2 ||| The romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be.
2 ||| Imagine the CleanFlicks version of 'Love Story,' with Ali MacGraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes.
2 ||| Beers, who, when she's given the right lines, can charm the paint off the wall ... [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures.
2 ||| The film is old-fashioned, occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface.
2 ||| If religious films aren't your bailiwick, stay away. Otherwise, this could be a passable date film.
2 ||| A competent but self-righteous film that offers little insight into love or faith.
2 ||| Recommended solely for Walter Huston's performance.
2 ||| It is quite a worthy pictorial offering with a genuinely fine and inspiring performance by Walter Huston in the role of the martyred President.
4 ||| Brilliant flashes of direction permeate the entire film, and it remains distinctively a product of the great master.
2 ||| Feels like a relic, a sad, weak swan song from one of cinema's most legendary filmmakers.
2 ||| ...while Dark Water isn't a complete wash (no pun intended), watched side-by-side with Ringu, it ultimately comes off as a pale successor.
4 ||| The picture is melancholy remembrance and its sources of fear are intimate and brilliant.
1 ||| A horror movie that sits there and drags and seems very full of itself, and is based on the premise that puddles are scary. They're not.
4 ||| just beneath its surface horror this film conceals a deep reservoir of tragedy, addressing themes like family breakdown, isolation, abandonment, and - something of a taboo in Japan - the terrible legacy of mental illness.
2 ||| With extremely heavy echoes of his own 1998 film Ringu, Nakata is on subtle creep-out form here rather than big horror movie mode.
4 ||| To date, the scariest movie I've ever seen.
4 ||| Um terror bem construdo que no quer apenas provocar sustos passageiros, mas sim estabelecer um clima de tenso constante e personagens com os quais realmente nos importemos.
2 ||| So much of Dark Water is contrived that it defies the mind to try to make sense of it.
3 ||| He [Nakata] wants us to absorb, to feel a location, and to understand the plight of the characters before he goes any further.
3 ||| Benefits from having an undercurrent of sadness, which makes it feel quite similar to the ghost stories in Kwaidan.
3 ||| The Accused demonstrates that rape victims often are suspects in their own cases.
3 ||| Enough of a social commentary to make it worthwhile
3 ||| has a slightly torrid made-for-TV feel to it ..., but is elevated by the superb performances and genuinely empathetic stance its takes
3 ||| A sobering and seriously well-acted tale of rape and retribution.
3 ||| ...the movie's certainly worth seeing, if only for Foster's award winning performance.
3 ||| Powerful rape drama.
2 ||| A atuação intensa e corajosa de Jodie Foster quase redime um filme que, graças à direção burocrática de Kaplan, parece ter sido realizado para a televisão.
3 ||| Possibly the best performance Foster has even given, and the best of its type
2 ||| Despite the strong emotional connection many Miamians will feel toward the movie, The Lost City falls far short of the sweep, complexity and passion it strives for.
2 ||| Garcia's overindulgence is punishing but I didn't come to the theatre to be soaked in soap opera sentiment.
2 ||| Garcia offers the film to the Cuban community as something we should all be happy to see, but his esteem does not excuse the film's aesthetic mediocrity, cultural ignorance, and colossal self-absorption.
2 ||| Garcia's aching nostalgia for the glittering Havana of his dreams is palpable, but he winds up painting by the same 'doomed romance against a backdrop of revolution' numbers as piffle like Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights.
2 ||| ... a lost movie that seems like it takes 16 years to end.
2 ||| How the movie's politics will sit with the audience aside, one of the problems in this overlong melodrama is the distracting casting of Bill Murray as a wisecracking sidekick and Dustin Hoffman as mobster Meyer Lansky.
2 ||| The sprawling -- two hours, 23 minutes -- epic meanders in places and its mix of tones and templates do not always serve its narrative. But the movie comes from the heart, filled with a passion that carries it through its rougher patches.
2 ||| ... the film seems like a mini-series edited to feature length without time for character development.
1 ||| The Lost City manages to make Havana, Sydney Pollack's disastrous 1990 attempt at a Casablanca homage set against the Cuban revolution with Robert Redford, look good by comparison.
2 ||| ... a haphazard jumble.
2 ||| Noteworthy and well-intended, The Lost City isn't exactly a lost opportunity, just a sincerely limited one.
2 ||| ... a romantic epic manque that swoons across the screen for nearly two and a half hours without saying much ...
2 ||| This is a very sad and winsome film.
2 ||| Handsomely executed but hopelessly flawed.
3 ||| Throbbing with music, seething with anger and romance, The Lost City is a film that breaks your heart, bewilders, alienates and ravishes you by turns.
2 ||| The Lost City has a subject, a setting and a historical backdrop, but in the foreground it has a relatively passive protagonist, Fico, whose passions are understated and whose fortunes inspire only minor concern.
3 ||| Overdirected, yes, but it's an epic, passionate portrayal.
3 ||| Feels like the distillation of countless conversations and family legends, rehearsed from time immemorial by Cubans who fled their homeland and sought to re-create it in their memories.
1 ||| It's the sort of epic that aspires to tell Cuba's modern political history and celebrate its people without introducing us to a single believable character.
2 ||| Musical...handsome...poignantly nostalgic...The Lost City is a lot of things, but what it's not is incisive.
2 ||| You can see why Garcia was drawn to this material, but he hasn't had much luck shaping it into a film.
3 ||| As a musical fever dream of paradise lost, The Lost City is a flawed success, boasting just enough truth and admirable purpose to justify the hazards of Garcia's passion.
2 ||| The coming CD, not the DVD, should be the keeper.
2 ||| A pretty bauble, a trinket offered when the stakes of barter were life and death.
2 ||| What makes this movie interesting is the family (and not just because it's made up of 3 beautiful brothers). It's a love story, between a man and a woman and between a people and their country.
1 ||| If you want to see a good, entertaining movie about Havana, circa 1958, better to rent Havana, than waste your money on this turkey.
2 ||| Garcia's fans and viewers who love Cuban music will probably enjoy The Lost City if they don't mind the long run time.
2 ||| Our cue that Garcia is acting is when he furiously bats his eyes in his smoldering emotional scenes. Either that, or he's allergic to the smoke from all those Cuban cigars.
2 ||| It's barely coherent as it is, but at 2 hours and 23 minutes, The Lost City is simply infuriating.
2 ||| The movie has too many stories to tell and tells none of them very well.
1 ||| Turgid, lumpy and almost unwatchably dull.
3 ||| It's a potent work, enlivened by fabulous Cuban music and Garcia's obvious love for his land and his culture.
2 ||| Unfortunately, Garcia is inept as a director. His scenes are shapeless and bloated with self-important speeches.
3 ||| Unsteady but often entrancing.
2 ||| It's handsome and heartfelt but mired in murky politics, plot inertia, musical montages and painfully pointed symbolism.
2 ||| Garcia needed better guiding hands and eyes in the editing room to jettison the many parts that bog down the story.
2 ||| Even though the movie is made with an abundance of heart, it's sad to report that the final result has only a weak pulse.
2 ||| Book-ended by fine songs; in between, Garcia offers more than two hours of clumsy Coppola/Scorsese karaoke...
1 ||| For a tribute to a lost city, Garcia has made a lost film.
2 ||| The result has a potluck rather than persuasive, integrated quality.
2 ||| Garcia's storytelling lacks highs and lows and has far too much going on. And on.
2 ||| While the soundtrack of Cuban dance music is superb, this historical drama is leaden and simply too long-winded for its own good.
3 ||| ...plays like a confusing and inferior Caribbean analog to The Godfather, without anything like the narrative drive of Coppola's film.
2 ||| It's by no means a flawless film, but it's a meaty one, and if you're a big fan of Andy Garcia, I'd definitely recommend it. (Plus, Bill Murray's in there.)
2 ||| Garcia obviously has more ambition than skill.
2 ||| Andy Garcia's directorial debut is a flawed and overlong but nonetheless watchable drama with strong performances, a superb soundtrack and bizarre appearances from Dustin Hoffman and Bill Murray.
1 ||| 'The Lost City' is intriguing as a historical document and adequate as cinema, but it has a blandness at its core that no amount of spicy mambo and booty-quaking dance routines can disguise.
2 ||| There may be a good film here, but it struggles to break free of the cumbersome framework.
1 ||| Andy Garcia's preposterous vanity project The Lost City is an all-singing, all-dancing version of the Cuban Revolution.
2 ||| The script is scrupulously even-handed, but Garcia can't seem to get a grip on this sprawl.
1 ||| Great music and costumes, but with a woeful plot and jaw-droppingly stilted dialogue. Cuban-born Garcia's main complaint against Fidel seems to be that rich, corrupt Cubans could no longer dance the night away.
2 ||| Not an embarrassment, but definitely a missed opportunity.
1 ||| By the half way point I was beginning to take back everything I said re Steven Soderbergh's dull-as-ditchwater Che: Part II - even he manages to drum up more tension than this.
4 ||| The Breaking Point adapts Hemingway's book and wrings out some genuine notes of solid tragedy, as well as a more nuanced performance from its lead actor.
4 ||| The insistence and courage of the film's final shot elevates it from a very good film to a nearly great one.
3 ||| Harry may be tough, but in Curtiz' hands he's basically a nice guy in noirland.
3 ||| Phyllis Thaxter steals the show. Her scenes are the best in the movie, and some of the best domestic scenes in cinema history. You don't often see a husband and wife on equal footing like this, nor do you see it this sexually charged.
3 ||| Arguably the superior mounting of the Ernest Hemingway story, The Breaking Point proves moral gloom exists as equally and virulently sunny-side up.
3 ||| Adam's Rib gives us writers, performers and a director all operating at peak levels of performance; it's a classic comedy.
3 ||| Enjoyable Tracy-Hepburn comedy. Maybe not great, but very good
3 ||| Of Adam's Rib we might say...that it isn't solid food but it certainly is meaty and juicy and comically nourishing.
3 ||| Really funny movie. I enjoyed this one!
3 ||| Classic stuff.
3 ||| Sex Wars mid-century style. Adam's Rib can't help but look a bit dated, but it sure is a perfect encapsulation of a certain type of couple at a certain time.
3 ||| Irresistable comedy from one of Hollywood's greatest pairings.
4 ||| Delightful, sophisticated comedy sparked by the famous chemistry between Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.
2 ||| Thanks to an at times sharp script, solid lead performances, and a scene stealing supporting turn by Judy Holliday, Adam's Rib is an entertaining enough film to warrant a solid review. But one of the great comedies of all time? Not even close.
3 ||| Despite many improbabilities, this is a barbed and entertaining comedy thanks to some great casting and a very clever Kanin/Gordon script
2 ||| It feels as if it's more about how a couple can playfully fight while facing off in a courtroom rather than whether or not women should be treated impartially.
2 ||| Though handsomely mounted, this parable of intersecting destinies and implacable tragedy is as lifeless as a wax tableau.
1 ||| The Bridge of San Luis Rey raises an important philosophical question: Is it better to fall to one's death from a rickety rope bridge overlooking a deep gorge or watch this miserable movie about several people sharing that awful fate?
0 ||| An endless powdered-wigs-and-feathered-pen slog.
1 ||| So dully written and executed that you'll be wishing the production had collapsed instead of the swaying bridge of San Luis Rey.
2 ||| The Viceroy states that they are 'surrounded by an ocean of boredom' - then you realize you're swimming in it.
1 ||| How bad could a movie be that features talent as serious as Robert De Niro, Kathy Bates, Gabriel Byrne, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham and Geraldine Chaplin? That bad, alas.
1 ||| Audiences may wonder why a picture with Robert De Niro, Kathy Bates and Harvey Keitel would be so bereft of hype. After you've endured the film, all 120 airless minutes, you'll understand the rationale behind the quiet release.
2 ||| As a director, McGuckian is overwhelmed by the immensity of her cast, and her misguided attempt to make a Hollywood epic on a European production budget.
3 ||| It is an intense philosophical undertaking that examines questions of faith, fate and chance.
2 ||| Best characterized as an honourable folly.
1 ||| the worst film of the year... a fraud of the highest order
2 ||| leaves audience with the same unanswered question as the one asked by its narrator
0 ||| How to turn an embarrassment of riches into an embarrassment, period.
1 ||| The Bridge of San Luis Rey is a beautiful movie. The film's shooting locations are exquisite. The sets are stunning. The costumes are gorgeous. The actors are superlative. Too bad the movie sucks.
2 ||| Losey's script is fine, but doesn't really draw the audience in, or inspire compassion for any of the characters.
3 ||| A scary, fascinating film.
4 ||| a ferociously perverse noir masterpiece
2 ||| Director Losey and screenwriter Trumbo aren't providing the usual mystery tale here.
4 ||| The rectangle-within-a-rectangle symmetry of the window within the frame of the movie screen in the opening scene reinforces the notion that the filmgoer is essentially a licensed Peeping Tom...
3 ||| The Prowler becomes a twisted vision of American entrepreneurship, with the two leads forming a grotesque nuclear family.
3 ||| The notion of a police stalker bending rules for the sake of controlling a situation and possessing a woman would continue to fuel mind-benders for decades to come.
2 ||| We got two and a half more months of crap to go before we get to the holiday/awards season.
2 ||| The movie was made just four years ago by Argentinian director Fabian Bielinsky. It is called Nine Queens, and it is vastly superior to this blah U.S. remake from director Gregory Jacobs.
2 ||| Criminal's biggest offense may be that Jacobs and his actors make absolutely no attempt to rewrite Nine Queens.
3 ||| [Full of] fine acting and sharp dialog.
2 ||| By the end, those who haven't seen Nine Queens may applaud the entertaining sleight-of-hand...those who have may lament that Criminal is the proverbial old dog.
3 ||| The result isn't as compelling as Nine Queens, but it's a respectable caper movie in the tradition of The Sting and David Mamet's Heist.
3 ||| A classic crime caper that twists and turns with an easy subtly.
2 ||| an easy mark to make and a hard movie to sell to paying customers.
2 ||| A retread and it feels like it.
3 ||| The returns will be diminished for those too familiar with the story.
3 ||| a quirky daylight noir with a plot that spins on a dime as its twists and turns on its way to proving that it's greed, not love, that doth make fools of us all
3 ||| We know someone is pulling something, and someone is going to get away with something, and someone is going to be left holding the bag of cheese, but Jacobs keeps us on our toes.
2 ||| Manages to satisfy despite being inferior to the original on nearly every level.
3 ||| John C. Reilly stars as a gimlet-eyed con man in this clever and diverting adaptation of the Argentine thriller Nine Queens.
2 ||| A light, speedy movie, as agreeably modest as a pop hit or a BLT.
3 ||| Habitual duplicity and backstabbing create a stimulating, deceptively intricate plot maze in this sharp, shrewd, but not showy remake.
3 ||| It's all done with sufficient style that, when we get there, the end no longer feels like the point.
3 ||| The finest tribute I can lavish on this stateside remake of 2002's Argentinean export Nine Queens is that it took me a full hour to remember I had seen the original -- and reviewed it, no less.
2 ||| This remake of the Argentine hit is effective at times, and Gyllenhaal shows a new side of her talent, but the main impression is of first-rate performers doing second-rate work.
4 ||| It's hip, witty and fun, and will remind you why movies are made in the first place.
3 ||| It's an auspicious debut for first-timer Gregory Jacobs.
4 ||| Fans of con-man capers will have no regrets after watching Criminal.
2 ||| Jacobs doesn't add anything new to the genre, but his version of taking the concepts out for a walk is entertaining enough to mark time until Ocean's Twelve.
2 ||| An exercise where viewers are likely to ponder not 'How did the characters do it?' but 'Who cares?'
2 ||| ...newbies looking for an easy-breezy Ocean's Eleven-and-a-Half should get a kick out of this frugally low-key, innocuous cover song of a caper.
2 ||| The remake is infinitely more entertaining if you haven't seen Nine Queens -- the details are different, but the surprises are the same and something of the first film's underlying darkness has been lost in translation.
3 ||| Maybe watching Reilly, Luna and Gyllenhaal is quite enough entertainment value for any movie.
2 ||| The problems lie not with the actors but with a glib approach that exposes the flaws of the original story.
3 ||| The fast, forced plot, which moves up from street grifts to a big score involving rare currency, lives in the amusing and zippered byplay of Luna and Reilly, who achieve a sort of marriage du jour for criminal purposes.
3 ||| It's a good film, suitably entertaining, but there's the nagging question of why everyone bothered.
2 ||| In the end, coincidence undoes Criminal.
3 ||| Those unfamiliar with Fabian Bielinsky's 2002 film will delight to this delicious deviousness.
2 ||| The constant shadow of doubt keeps the viewer from investing in the characters, because we suspect one or more of them isn't what they seem.
2 ||| Entertaining and well acted, but redundant and a bit machinelike.
3 ||| Doesn't exactly reinvigorate an overworked genre, but neither does it disgrace the format or the original movie.
3 ||| It's such a pleasure being in the company of these actors as they work with character-rich material that if they burst into the audience and swindled us out of our wallets, we would gladly oblige.
2 ||| It's a listless, dutiful affair -- a cover version played out of obligation, not inspiration.
3 ||| Its spiral of deceptions within deceptions remains resolutely character-based until the outlandish end, which proves emotionally satisfying because it's based on what really drives people as much as too-clever plotting.
3 ||| An incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams.
2 ||| This is the kind of movie so full of coincidence and double crosses that you simply don't have the mental energy to go back and sort it all out at the end.
3 ||| What elevates Criminal into a delicious con in the league of Red Rock West, House of Games or Matchstick Men is John C. Reilly.
2 ||| Follows the original fairly closely, and because I already knew the plot secrets, it couldn't work on me in its intended way. As the recycled characters, dialog and events turned up, there seemed to be an echo in the room.
2 ||| Glances at family dynamics and class divisions benefit the genre mix, and the cast animates the lean script with a simmering brew of charm, smarm, ferocious greed and street smarts.
3 ||| Reilly sheds a career playing dupes and schlubs and gives his first full-tilt electric performance.
3 ||| Scores higher than most con artist movies by focusing more on the artists than the con.
3 ||| Criminal has a wonderful modern film noir feel punctuated with incredibly clever dialog...
2 ||| It has half the panache and none of the surprise for anyone who saw the original.
3 ||| It's funny, fast-paced, and sharp - as entertaining in English as it was in Spanish.
2 ||| Criminal can be praised and damned for its fidelity to the Argentinean masterpiece Nine Queens.
2 ||| If subtitles are not your thing and you're in the mood to witness an elegant con job in the classic Mamet mold, then Criminal is the card to play.
3 ||| A competent Americanization of the Argentinian film "Nine Queens," with John C. Reilly seemingly enjoying his atypical leading role.
2 ||| even when the emotional aspect of the story starts to work, it is ultimately undermined by a final twist
2 ||| Not smooth or seductive enough to coerce you into taking it at face value.
2 ||| Like dj vu all over again.
2 ||| Maybe I'm dense, but the finale of Criminal left me not exactly sure what was won and what was lost or why I should care.
2 ||| With dashes of black humour and pointed glimpses of the American class system, Criminal is a taut con-versus-con game whose deft artistry isn't fully revealed until the last few minutes.
2 ||| A kind of who-done-what? puzzle. You'll probably enjoy it much more if you haven't seen the 2002 Argentine film, Nine Queens.
2 ||| You can't go too far wrong on the performance front with John C. Reilly, Diego Luna or Maggie Gyllenhaal, but this one never really goes above average.
2 ||| Yet another inexplicable American remake that adds nothing new to the original.
2 ||| The remake is so faithful to the first film that some of the snap and crackle disappears if you know the plot. It's like watching The Sixth Sense for a second time.
3 ||| This is one of the best con movies I have seen as rare currency is used as the valuable commodity.
4 ||| Like a smash-and-grab job, the movie gets in, springs the con and gets out quick - leaving the viewer to replay the twists on his or her own time.
3 ||| While the twists at the end are a little more predictable here than in the first film, it's still an assured work, especially considering that it comes from a first-time director.
2 ||| Redundant.
3 ||| Reilly is perhaps the most amazing fusion of boy and man we have in American movies.
2 ||| Considerando-se que o timo Nove Rainhas foi realizado h apenas alguns anos, esta refilmagem soa desnecessria, por mais interessante que seja seu roteiro.
2 ||| ...the interaction of the movie's two leads, Reilly and Luna, is so good you might enjoy it for their performances alone.
2 ||| [It's] a safer, watered-down, but still enjoyable redo.
2 ||| Those viewers who watched NUEVE REINAS beforehand will be affected with increasingly unpleasant feeling of deja vu.
3 ||| Like Richard Widmark, [John C. Reilly] is an excellent character actor who can convey both likeability and pathetical desperation simultaneously.
2 ||| This con man movie is best for older teens and up.
3 ||| Filmmaker Gregory Jacobs, making his debut here, delivers an opening half hour that's perhaps not as compelling as it could (or should) have been...
2 ||| There's nothing stars John C. Reilly and Diego Luna can do to make you forget you're watching the same story.
3 ||| There's more than enough weird and wise material to keep you entertained -- especially if you're an animation buff or a Samuel Clemens aficionado.
2 ||| Dry humor and scary scenes abound in Twain overview.
2 ||| This is an imaginative work.
3 ||| Such a wonderfully entertaining and rather charming film.
3 ||| The filmmakers startlingly bring to life the beauty and balance of nature.
3 ||| Taking us from God's-eye-views of the sparkling surface to the darkest depths, this ocean odyssey conveys a riveting sense of nature's infinite variety.
2 ||| The big screen adds extra impact to inspiring images which capture all the brutality, camaraderie and absurdity of the ocean.
4 ||| Practically every shot in Deep Blue offers some sort of remarkable, jaw-dropping sight.
2 ||| Mother Nature reveals herself not so much as an entity that needs to be preserved but an action director much fiercer than Michael Bay.
3 ||| Numerous films have explored undersea life, but few as comprehensively and as consistently compelling as Deep Blue.
2 ||| Wide-ranging documentary on the mysteries and marvels of the ocean and the creatures that reside there.
2 ||| Alternately mind-blowing and mind-numbing.
2 ||| The film keeps facts and figures to a minimum and lets the breathtaking images (underscored by George Fenton's sometimes bombastic score) carry the show.
2 ||| Deep Blue is a beautiful movie, nicely scored and elegantly shot. But it's all about as thrilling as a good aquarium.
2 ||| It's about half an hour too long and Pierce Brosnan's sonorous narration threatens to lull us to sleep on those rocking waves.
2 ||| A beautiful but empty-headed documentary about the creatures that lurk in the sea.
3 ||| It may not actually be comprehensive, but it feels like Deep Blue touches on all the points worth knowing, and more just for fun.
2 ||| Even with consistently impressive camerawork, the movie still feels like the visual equivalent of elevator music -- with frolicking dolphins instead of Elton John ballads.
4 ||| A better action movie than most of what you'll see this summer, and there are certainly more visceral thrills.
3 ||| It goes on a little too long for mostly just pretty pictures, and you get more wonder than educational detail, but it's fascinating to look at.
3 ||| Documentary about the ocean's panorama of life is full of beauty, awe, terror, wonder -- and jaw-dropping cinematography.
3 ||| If nature films had genres, Deep Blue would be an action movie.
2 ||| A sumptuous but occasionally soporific nature documentary.
2 ||| There's certainly enough to hold one's interest during Deep Blue, but you won't learn as much as you would through a single corridor of Chicago's Shedd Aquarium.
2 ||| British filmmakers Andy Byatt and Alstair Fothergill don't try to teach us much; they just ask us to look at pretty fish.
3 ||| Deep Blue is like the oceans: stunningly beautiful and packed with shocking violence.
3 ||| Absorbing.
2 ||| Unfortunately, the film tries to say too much, and as a result ends up saying nothing. Also, this G-rated film contains scenes of animal attacks that are much too intense for young audiences.
2 ||| Stunning images of undersea life, ... but the footage is pieced together haphazardly, sometimes repetitively.
2 ||| we've been in an ocean-documentary glut of late, and Deep Blue just doesn't have much in it that we haven't seen a few times before
4 ||| Honestly: In how many movies can you see a polar bear attacking a bunch of whales?
3 ||| The information you find inside may not be anything more than you haven't garnered from watching Animal Planet, but it is an extremely well made and well shot piece.
2 ||| Deep Blue could have lived its life on TV and felt more at home
2 ||| Stunning footage of aquatic life.
4 ||| This is one of the truly great adventure films of all time, and features a terrific performance by the perfectly cast Flynn.
4 ||| A wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful, cartoonish figures.
4 ||| There are classics and then there are Classics. This one's required viewing for any self-respecting movie geek.
4 ||| The classic swashbukler. They don't get better than this
4 ||| Wanna smile? A lot? Rent this movie.
4 ||| One of the most thrilling adventures ever put on film, every frame, performance, music theme, and line a masterpiece.
4 ||| The Adventures of Robin Hood shows the studio system could produce works of pure energy and joy.
4 ||| Few storybooks have been more brilliantly brought to life, page for page, chapter for chapter, derring-do for derring-do.
3 ||| An entertaining 100 minutes that's well worth the price of admission, even if it's flawed in several respects.
4 ||| Fast-paced and loose, this 120-minute production concentrates mostly on fun, energy and high spirits.
4 ||| In these cynical days when swashbucklers cannot be presented without an ironic subtext, this great 1938 film exists in an eternal summer of bravery and romance.
3 ||| it's a 65-year-old classic that still holds its rank as a movie among movies
4 ||| Superb Flynn adventure in every way.
4 ||| A flawless swashbuckler!
4 ||| [Flynn] catapults across the screen with the greatest of ease, exuding so much charm and confidence that he seems to klieg-light the film all by himself.
4 ||| Errol Flynn buckles his swashes in this classic historical adventure.
4 ||| ...the quintessential movie swashbuckler.
4 ||| A rousing, high-spirited family entertainment rightly regarded as one for the ages. [Blu-ray]
4 ||| A rousing and fun popcorn movie of the highest order.
4 ||| Errol Flynn stars in swashbuckling family delight.
4 ||| Nearly every aspect of the Robin Hood myth we know today is embodied in this exciting, socially aware adventure.
4 ||| The film is completely unabashed and utterly committed to delivering on its promise of adventure.
3 ||| Staff battling and sword fighting choreography are quite amusing, with Flynn and Rathbone engaging in believable matches of lightning-fast fencing.
3 ||| a daring film that explicitly prefigures the surge of anti-Nazi cinema that was to come
3 ||| has moments of ingenuity and, at times, reflects the prowess of its creator but it's also a testament to sheer talent
2 ||| it seems to lose sight of the daring adventure aspect and swerves into a fluffy romance
4 ||| In 'Man Hunt,' tracking shots are literally tracking shots: When Lang's camera glides, it's in pursuit of a quarry, as if it were participating in what the movie's hero refers to as 'a sporting stalk.'
3 ||| If one sought proof that his pre-war and post-war work were both products of the same mind, one need look no further than his 1941 film Man Hunt.
2 ||| Like a Twilight Zone episode stretched out into a feature ... without adding much subtext.
2 ||| Apesar dos personagens caricaturais (principalmente o adolescente irritante), cria boa dose de suspense e conta com um final intrigante.
3 ||| There's great promise in Dead End, and a script that is often clever, combined with a carload of decent actors, really helps cover a multitude of flaws.
3 ||| A small film like Dead End sneaks in and manages to floor pretty much everyone that's seen it.
2 ||| A funny and rollickingly good movie about the challenges of keeping a band together on the road.
2 ||| Director Russell is gifted with an eye for the extreme, but sometimes he gets ahead of himself, thinking that odd camera angles and crude delivery will save a threadbare plot.
1 ||| Whore, directed by the Spanish filmmaker who uses the pseudonym Luna, is a tedious, not-at-all titillating exploitation film.
2 ||| Is there anything remotely new left to be said about the world's oldest profession? Perhaps, but Spanish director Maria Lidon's glossy film, which sets sleekly staged interviews with European prostitutes within a fictional story, never finds the words.
1 ||| A shallow film.
2 ||| Two phoned-in performances do not a romance make.
1 ||| screenwriter Dean Georgaris has cherry-picked his way through [the legend] unable to synthesize what he has chosen to use into anything close to the compelling, passionate, and achingly poetic tale that has come down to us.
1 ||| He freezes his face and half-fills his eyes as lovelorn fighter Tristan; the very Madame Toussaud effigy of Andy Gibb in a tunic, he lets his leonine mane do the emoting.
1 ||| Part Gladiator, part Braveheart, part Romeo and Juliet, Tristan & Isolde is all boring.
3 ||| Tristan & Isolde is the first pleasant surprise of 2006...Kevin Reynolds is a pretty good director when he's not associated with Kevin Costner.
2 ||| This relationship lacks a critical ingredient: passion.
2 ||| Franco's curly locks may make the target audience swoon, but his presence never allows the rest of us to completely sink into Tristan & Isolde.
1 ||| When a war is going down, why are the king and his fiercest lieutenants taking a time-out to attend to the lovesick?
2 ||| Bypasses the mythic tone of Richard Wagner's opera...without forsaking storybook romance. The inoffensive results get the job done, but sadly fail to excite.
2 ||| Everything is a little too overdone.
2 ||| There is something undeniably pleasant about an entertainment like Tristan & Isolde that delivers exactly what it promises, no less, no more.
2 ||| Though Reynolds' film tops two hours (which in a season of epics seems almost trim), he keeps the action brisk.
3 ||| Tristan has its slightly silly moments, but rather like those fondly remembered epics of Hollywood past, its energy and entertainment value carry the day.
2 ||| Mindless, predictable and mildly entertaining.
1 ||| Tristan and Isolde is the story on which William Shakespeare based Romeo and Juliet, and, judging from the movie, he's a heck of a rewrite man.
3 ||| The knights and ladies don't look like escapees from a Prince Valiant comic strip, but like physical, vulnerable, survivors of the conflicts left behind by the Romans.
3 ||| ...never quite attains the full weight and grandeur that its tragic love story demands. Yet the movie is nothing to scoff at.
2 ||| The film gives off the feeling of being incredibly bored with itself. The feeling, sadly, is contagious.
3 ||| Even though the time period has been brilliantly captured, it's too long and lacks pace. Even so, against all odds, I liked it. Many in my audience seemed to have a different opinion, laughing at lines that did not invite laughter.
1 ||| The end result plays out like a George Lucas film without spaceships and lightsabers.
2 ||| Director Kevin Reynolds isn't so much inspired as determined to tell it with period accuracy, without bothering to be historically accurate.
2 ||| The movie plods around, appears to pick up speed, but then falters. Worse, we never feel true sympathy for the lovers who are forced to risk all to meet in secret when fate and politics keep them apart.
2 ||| While Tristan & Isolde, a competent but uninspired film version of the legendary medieval romance, will likely fade from theaters and memories quickly, Myles' lovely face and spirited performance should linger.
1 ||| We don't find a tale of transcendent passion but rather of two vain nitwits in a case of routine attraction.
2 ||| Reynolds' film has an evocative, old-fashioned storybook look (as if designed by N.C. Wyeth or Aubrey Beardsley), and features strong performances.
2 ||| Filmed in breathtaking locations in Western Ireland and the Czech Republic, Tristan & Isolde is a disappointingly passion-free romance.
2 ||| The story itself -- Tristan falls in love with Isolde first, only to see her married off as part of a cold-hearted peace treaty -- is merely dreary, full of overwrought villainy and thuggish jousting.
2 ||| Trying to underplay things, the actors practically sleepwalk. When someone finally gets the chance to shout, 'Seize him!' he does so with as much gusto as the guy who says, 'WINS news time: 8:45.'
2 ||| It's that rare movie that had me wishing I was at the opera.
2 ||| Tristan & Isolde is deadly serious, straightforward and surprisingly entertaining tragedy that reinforces much of what we think we know about the Dark Ages in Britain.
2 ||| Reynolds has again delivered a lavish adventure for audiences who like their entertainment earnest and their storytelling straightforward.
2 ||| This whole movie feels so wrong that you're likely to develop a headache from all the eye rolling.
2 ||| It's all nicely shot, but Tristan And Isolde lacks the soul that has kept this story alive for a thousand-+ years.
2 ||| There's far more smiting than smooching -- more hewing of limbs than heaving of bosoms.
2 ||| Sorry, no magic here.
2 ||| Tristan & Isolde strives to be the good old-fashioned medieval kind of romance that stirs the soul. But due to the somewhat lackluster performances from the doomed young lovers, the film doesn't quite hit the mark.
2 ||| This Tristan is strictly for those who prefer their romantic melodrama bloodied up a bit.
2 ||| Unlike the opera, this version of the tale features no mystical elements and comes off as horribly contrived. What's more, director Kevin Reynolds' sluggish pacing makes the film feels twice as long as it really is.
2 ||| Franco looks appropriately troubled as Tristan. Myles is pretty and sweet enough to win hearts as Isolde.
1 ||| They are hollow people mooning their way through a backdrop of endless battles in which wild-haired, wild-eyed men chop each other about.
2 ||| The fate of two nations hinges on the nondisclosure of the stolen kisses and secret trysts. But, boy, could I have not cared less.
2 ||| No, Tristan & Isolde goes nowhere, does nothing and only succeeds at making an audience want for a more that never comes.
2 ||| ... a hard film to watch unless you bring your own pre-existing fascination with the material.
2 ||| The longer the film ran, the more I wanted to be put out of Tristan and Isolde's misery.
3 ||| one of those rare cinematic experiences that feels whole, that feels authentic.
3 ||| A sweeping, heartfelt tale, beautifully told, that works on multiple levels.
2 ||| In short, it's just not fun with the specter of tragedy looming over every scene.
2 ||| Across the board, it's far from special.
3 ||| I can wholeheartedly recommend Tristan & Isolde, even to those who don't have a penchant for period piece romances. The movie has a lot to offer.
2 ||| Yes! it's a story of love at first sight which will ring down the ages. But everyone seems bored with the whole nonsense.
3 ||| Stolen moments from other films abound but director Kevin Reynolds has clearly given the story and characters a life and identity of their own.
1 ||| The movie lacks style and pacing; Franco and Myles look too contemporary. They would be more at home with their romantic problems on some Fox or WB drama ...
3 ||| Arthur Reinhart's stunning images repeatedly isolate Isolde among the cool, gray expanse of natural settings. She's a freethinking woman at the mercy of powerful forces beyond her control, trapped in the wrong place at the wrong time in history.
2 ||| Do we really want less magic in our legends? And if these stories are stripped of their mythic aspects, are they even very interesting anymore?
2 ||| A handsomely assembled non-musical version of the legend ... the chinks in the armor creep in with James Franco, all lathered up in a weepy soap opera performance.
2 ||| It has action and intrigue, diabolic plots, a tournament of champions, and everything else you would expect from a medieval movie, but it has a tendency to over tell the story and needs more romance.
3 ||| The film's roots and execution are faithful to the source and allow the emotional and thematic complexity of the tale to shine through.
3 ||| A poignant, old-fashioned, history-heavy forbidden romance
2 ||| The legend of "Tristan & Isolde" happened a long time ago, so the story goes. And here it's retold as an average film that could have been worse, but could have been better, for the resume of director Kevin Reynolds.
2 ||| The movie attempts a sort of documentary realism in depicting a period that is largely undocumented %u2026 but as was the case with the flat-footed King Arthur of two years ago, you may miss the magic.
2 ||| ...never out-and-out boring...
2 ||| Much more A Knight's Tale than Romeo & Juliet
2 ||| A legendary love story set amidst violent clashes between English warlords and an Irish king fails to impress.
2 ||| Frequently rubbish but nonetheless enjoyable swashbuckler, despite a tendency to take itself a bit too seriously. More fun than King Arthur.
2 ||| Swords clank, star-crossed lovers yearn, yadda yadda yadda.
2 ||| Fans of historical epics will find much to like in the costuming, battle sequences and cinematography, but the love story itself is underdeveloped.
2 ||| The two leads, James Franco and Sophia Myles, generate a modicum of chemistry, despite being penned in by a clunky script.
2 ||| A compelling story washed down for a film that's likely only appeal to pre-teen girls.
2 ||| Unlike Franco's mop, no amount of teasing can keep this romance from falling flat.
2 ||| By removing the sorcery and operatic excess so synonymous with the story, the filmmakers conjure an affecting, pretty melodrama... with the emphasis more on mellow than drama.
3 ||| A strong visual style and a violent streak only partially undone by the PG-13 rating.
1 ||| The production is grimy and listless, without any color to be seen, literal or figurative -- not even those little red dots meant to deter piracy. But then, there's not much danger of that.
3 ||| Funciona principalmente graças à maneira eficaz com que retrata o amor do casal-título, que jamais deixa de soar convincente.
2 ||| A movie in which all necessities are captured in two hours of ambitious celluloid, except for one critical anchoring piece: a heart.
1 ||| one of those movies you keep in that special shelf, to watch them when you're ready to kill yourself, just to make sure you made the right decision
2 ||| Tristan & Isolde isn't the sort of film you'd go out of your way for, but you could certainly do a lot worse.
2 ||| The performances are all raw and natural, and they are filmed in a close-up and often very intimate way.
2 ||| Welcome to the world of film festival cinema. We hope you enjoy your stay, or at least don't fall asleep in the next hour and a half.
2 ||| The primary impression is lots of moping and mooning, + a song at the beginning with some of the worst lyrics you've ever heard.
3 ||| The collage of poetic visual asides and emotional exchanges courts effusiveness, but it remains earnest and hauntingly expressive of an inner human turmoil.
2 ||| Stony and statuesque, Michelini is an excellent casting choice: Her impassive face and dispassionate voice serve as a carefully constructed protective mask that hides her pain, and which she rarely lets slip.
2 ||| Viewers are either going to walk out after 10 minutes or, like this tolerant critic, get caught up in the sordid lives of the three misfits and stick around for the ambiguous ending.
2 ||| The film explains why Stphanie and her bisexual boyfriends need each other, but doesn't depict why they are drawn to each other, making the mnage  trois mechanical.
3 ||| Lyrical yet succinct.
3 ||| A weirder mnage  trois you will never encounter.
2 ||| Amid all the discussion of crust and sauce and the proper consistency of each, A Tale of Two Pizzas lays on the cheese way too thick.
2 ||| There is some trite Italian-American stereotypes on display, and the interstitial animated sequences have nothing to do with the plot and drag down this otherwise sprightly comedy.
1 ||| Any way you slice it, A Tale of Two Pizzas is so ineptly written and directed that it's pretty soggy entertainment.
2 ||| Though it bears absolutely no relation to real life, this sweetly silly modern fairy tale possesses just enough charm to endear itself to secret sentimentalists.
1 ||| The aesthetically derivative Kramer takes a misguided turn into Tony Scott territory with his latest.
2 ||| A kinetic guilty pleasure.
2 ||| Tthe gimmicks can't hold up a weak, implausible plot that substitutes violence and gore for a smart story and believable characters.
3 ||| I see Running Scared as a slick, sick, and sly satire of all the action flick conventions, but maybe I'm just nuts.
2 ||| I can't believe I am saying this, but Paul Walker doesn't stink in Running Scared. In fact, Running Scared is a decent guys night out movie.
0 ||| A vile disaster.
2 ||| Kramer stokes kinetic energy and hard-R intensity...may amount to no more than a punch to the gut, but...it's all in bad fun.
2 ||| Could have been a good exploitation flick if it didn't get carried away with piling on the plot twists.
2 ||| genuinely clunky
2 ||| A potential howler done in by a tendency to wear too much body tissue on its sleeve.
2 ||| In the gleefully violent Running Scared, the writer and director Wayne Kramer tries to go over the rainbow and put a self-consciously bloody spin on once upon a time.
3 ||| With a complex plot that unspools with surprising clarity, Running Scared displays a reckless intensity.
3 ||| Running Scared goes so far over the top, it circumnavigates the top and doubles back on itself; it's the Mobius Strip of over-the-topness. I am in awe.
3 ||| If Running Scared sometimes looks like a storyboard sprung violently to life, Kramer's assured direction turns that into its greatest strength in the clinches, of which there are plenty.
2 ||| It's like a gruesome merry-go-round filled with unpleasant characters and bad acting.
3 ||| Luciano Pavarotti's eyebrows during the Olympic opening ceremonies were disturbing. Multiply that by about 1,000, and you have the creep-out factor in the gory Running Scared.
2 ||| If it's possible to admire his movie's heedless energy, it's also possible to hate its guts.
1 ||| This is the kind of movie where character development consists of a guy mentioning in passing he has a meth lab in his back yard.
2 ||| If Running Scared were set in Hell (the actual place, rather than a figure of speech), perhaps it would have been easier to swallow.
3 ||| A spinning-plates movie that only makes a shattered-glass mess in its finale with one twist for each character left standing. Otherwise, this empty-calorie eye-candy cartoon is an ultraviolent, boot-on-throat thiller with style and humor.
1 ||| Running Scared keeps ratcheting up the intensity, but to what end?
2 ||| Ethnic stereotyping, moral qualms and plot improbabilities aside, you just wish a movie like Running Scared wasn't so anxious to be exciting all the time: It gets so monotonous.
2 ||| The only things more abundant than gunshot-riddled corpses are the ridiculous plot twists and the laughably bad lines of dialog...it's likely to be the most fun at a bad movie you'll have for a while.
1 ||| There's clearly supposed to be tension between Joey's good and bad sides. Sure, he's a mobster, but he's also a family man, which makes him... gray. (Not black and white = very sophisticated.)
2 ||| [Director Wayne] Kramer, who showed such promise as a filmmaker with The Cooler, takes a couple of giant steps backward with Running Scared.
2 ||| In the opening minutes of Running Scared, a drug deal goes bad and takes the entire movie with it.
3 ||| It's way too violent and perversely excessive for many tastes, but there's more to its outrages than meets the eye, and that second look is well worth taking.
1 ||| There is a child at the center of this ultraviolent story, and the devices used to keep us on tenterhooks regarding his survival are appallingly manipulative.
3 ||| Let me be clear. I'm not saying I liked Running Scared from the get-go or for all the way through, start to finish, but I did like it all the same.
4 ||| Running Scared is for people who like movies, who don't need to have a movie mean something in order to enjoy it and who can delight at the sheer craft of a story designed only to shock, amuse and hold an audience.
2 ||| For a moment, it appears as if Running Scared has developed into a different, better movie. But subsequent gratuitously violent scenes hint at a determination by Kramer to keep his film at low-grade exploitation level.
2 ||| It's hard to believe that this mess was made by the same man who made The Cooler.
2 ||| It's borderline irresponsible, a virtual horror movie of a gangster thriller.
2 ||| Kramer seems to be aping Quentin Tarantino's brilliant tangents in Pulp Fiction, but he doesn't have Tarantino's imagination or gift for dialogue.
2 ||| This overlong fantasy of urban violence is so far over the top -- you might as well be watching a computer monitor while somebody else has a high time playing the video game Grand Theft Auto.
3 ||| Running Scared is a vicious and brutal B-movie jacked up to hysterical, hallucinatory proportions -- a pulpy, violent action picture that torments the viewer as much as its characters, and I mean that as a compliment.
0 ||| With a herky-jerky visual style and a plot riddled with bullet holes, Running Scared is a brutal, misanthropic and downright nasty excuse for bang-bang entertainment.
1 ||| As the movie becomes more howlingly ludicrous by the second, it's tempting -- and not in a cynical way, either -- to start reading it as a parody of pornographic video game violence.
0 ||| Kramer's grating bombast exists only to call attention to itself as well as the complete absence of any moral implications or recognizable human behavior in the film.
3 ||| The script is so stupid that at times you'll want to roll your eyes in the dark; you won't, though, because you might miss some of the action.
2 ||| But even beyond its sleazy pandering and sensationalism, the film's worst transgression is its exploitation of young children.
0 ||| ...an abhorrently exploitative exercise in child endangerment.
1 ||| You could laugh off the film's more over-the-top aspects -- including the performances and its quasi-Quentin Tarantino dialogue -- if it didn't treat women and children with such brutality and contempt.
1 ||| Running Scared is about as hard an "R" rating as you can get, with buckets of blood, full- frontal nudity and swearing that would peel gum from the sidewalk.
2 ||| Running Scared will be reviled by those who deplore violence and adored by those who like their movies brutally edgy.
0 ||| Running Scared will probably play best in prisons, where lowlifes, applauding the heroic amounts of foul language and blood, will be heartened to know that society has finally stooped to their level.
1 ||| A depressing piece of gun-crazy Hollywood scuzz that, with its gassy style and runaway immorality, makes a Tony Scott movie look like a Robert Bresson picture.
2 ||| Too bloated with its own seriousness to achieve the 'so sick, it's funny' vibe of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.
2 ||| Includes scenes that are laughable [gunfight in a 10x10 room] and one that features Vera Farmiga that will go down in history as a classic/fan favorite.
3 ||| For a picture so fetishistically obsessed with death, Running Scared is vibrantly alive.
2 ||| Impossible to adequately summarize, alienating at every tonal turn, off the rails with every storytelling and aesthetic choice, Running Scared is ambitious to a fault.
3 ||| Running Scared is an overly ambitious guilty pleasure with enough action and violence to keep you interested, it just doesn't have much else.
2 ||| This is a movie with yards and yards of plot, but none of it that makes much sense nor that you'll think about afterwards. Instead what you'll remember is the blood.
4 ||| Running Scared doesn't go over the top - it refuses to even acknowledge that there is a top.. it's like if Tarantino directed The Warriors
4 ||| The action movie is the cheese sandwich of film genres, but efforts like 'Running Scared' remind us all too rarely that they don't have to be Kraft Singles on Wonder Bread.
3 ||| Hello, cheesy fun! [It's] a roller coaster of a thrill ride.
2 ||| This film is so over the top at times that it takes one's breath away.
3 ||| Running Scared doesn't always work. All the same, it keeps up a nice pacing and throws in enough clever twists to keep the story interesting.
3 ||| Not since 'Very Bad Things' have I had this much fun with this kind of movie
2 ||| Running Scared is filled with plenty of blood-splattering violence, profanity, sexual perversions, and whatever other deviant behavior you can think of. What it doesn't have is any cohesiveness or finesse.
2 ||| Clumsily overwritten, straining badly to be a complex thriller but only generating small moments of believability.
3 ||| Wildly stylized and endlessly inventive, Running Scared doesn't go over the top -- it blows the top off and proceeds to dance in the rubble.
2 ||| If Running Scared is supposed to be a satire, it's not funny enough to work. If it's meant to be taken seriously, then it's the most unintentionally funny movie of the past ten years.
0 ||| Run away ... Just when you think Hollywood can't get any worse in an era of Bad Boys and Scream, it constantly surprises you with even more putrid product.
2 ||| The movie doesn't so much wallow in the abhorrent side of humanity as it showers, bathes, and dresses in it before heading off to work at MTV.
2 ||| Where Running Scared is concerned I'm a victim who has decided, maybe unwisely, not to press charges.
2 ||| Trying for a Tarantino-like riff on ultra-violence and over-the-top police corruption ... 'Running Scared' is a film noir on steroids.
0 ||| This is a vile, violent film with no raison d'etre.
2 ||| No one in their right minds could call this a good film, but it's certainly unique.
1 ||| The film's moral compass swings wildly out of control, blanketed in all manner of hyper-violent digital gore effects and a thick, black nausea of the soul. It's not even fun watching the monsters get their just deserts; it's just depressing.
2 ||| If you've ever wanted to see Paul Walker get repeatedly smashed in the teeth with a hockey puck then this is the movie for you.
3 ||| If you love over-stylized gunshots and action sequences, Running Scared is likely to be one big ol' kinetic romp of bloody fun that'll have you pulling out the Kleenex and appreciating all over the place.
1 ||| We haven't even mentioned the hockey puck torture scene, or the relentless ricochetting camerawork, or the multiple last minute switcheroos -- it's got more endings than Lord Of The Rings.
2 ||| Ultimately, it is a serviceable, well-made thriller that earns its R rating.
2 ||| Stylish, rollicking post-Tarantino trash which does the business at such a pace you barely notice its preposterousness.
2 ||| A montagem eficiente, com transies intrigantes, confere ritmo ao filme, que tambm se beneficia com a atuao surpreendentemente intensa de Walker. Pena que o roteiro seja to implausvel e o final, to absurdamente ridculo.
3 ||| An example of a film I recommend just because it tickled my undercarriage.
3 ||| A well-acted piece that should appeal to anyone who enjoys the films of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez.
2 ||| The action throughout Running Scared is involving and fast-paced enough that you don't notice the number of cliches being invoked in this film.
2 ||| It's a Bland, Dull, Dumb Movie.
1 ||| The landscape will survive this desecration; it's questionable whether the actors will.
2 ||| It's as goofy and crude as this sort of road movie usually is, but the drug jokes, bad language and endless sex wisecracks are bound to amuse the pre-teen and (young) adolescent set.
0 ||| An inexplicably dated, sexist Porky's knock-off.
1 ||| Ultraviolet will be studied with great interest in the future - not for its quality or its artistic merit, but rather to discover how a turd like this was made.
1 ||| The violence is presented in such a childish fashion, that it has all the impact of a Pokemon battle.
1 ||| Wimmer has created no logical framework for flashy, ultraviolent and frankly cheesy sequences.
1 ||| Kurt Wimmer's film epitomizes just about everything wrong with post-Matrix, comic book-/video-game-inspired, Hong Kong-action-style sci-fi thrillers.
2 ||| Ultraviolet is nice to gaze at but otherwise simplistic, senseless, and eminently skippable.
1 ||| Ultraviolet is all second act. There is no beginning to the story and no end; it's all middle. A non-sensical, hard to follow assemblage of action, completely devoid of any context.
2 ||| Cool martial arts and special effects barely make up for laughably atrocious writing and acting and an obvious sci-fi premise.
1 ||| ...shot two years ago... and now being unceremoniously dumped into your neighborhood cineplex, which -- thanks to films like this -- has been cluttered with as much garbage as a Skid Row alley in recent months.
1 ||| Although it masquerades as a futuristic action-thriller, Ultraviolet functions best as a multi-million dollar commercial for Milla Jovovich's personal trainer.
0 ||| Quite frankly, Jovovich should never let Wimmer do her any favors again and someone from the director's office should send Cassavetes' estate a letter of apology.
2 ||| Do the kids today even like all these video-game/manga/sci-fi movies that clutter multiplexes?
2 ||| a garbled mess of whiz bang and wouldn't-that-be-cool
0 ||| If you want to break up with your significant other, take him/her to this turd.
2 ||| The experience is merely interminable, wholly forgettable, and without the requisite thrills and spills.
2 ||| ... feels incomplete, as though the production ran out of time, money, or both.
0 ||| Ultraviolet takes all the badness of Catwoman and repackages it with the look of live action anime and the mentality of a video game you have no control over.
0 ||| Monumentally awful
2 ||| Whether Six is a blessing or a boon to mutants or humans is one of the many things that are not clearly explained through all the flying bodies, flashing steel and grinding metal.
0 ||| Ultrastupid, ultra-incoherent, ultrasilly -- and way, way ultraboring.
1 ||| Ultraviolet cleaves faithfully to its comic-book genealogy with a plot unobstructed by big words and images that rarely breach two dimensions. Ultrasilly.
1 ||| Wimmer ain't no Cassavetes.
1 ||| Uwe Boll would be proud of this movie. It's pretentious and oh-so-serious. The tone of the movie is one of high art, but it stinks like a landfill.
1 ||| Flat-out awful in almost every respect, Ultraviolet will hopefully drive the final nail in the coffin of the sci-fi/action-babe genre.
1 ||| The Yule log was way more entertaining.
1 ||| It's not bad enough to be funny, but it's not without its moments. Most of those come when Jovovich, not the best with a catch-phrase, answers some challenge with a put-down she should have practiced more in between personal trainer sessions.
0 ||| Her sword is red, her eyes are blue and her movie is horrible.
1 ||| Anyway, we went to Ultraviolet so you won't have to. It was awful. Next time you go, okay?
2 ||| If you have no problem with an experience that feels like an adrenaline shot administered directly to your brain, then this is the place to start.
1 ||| 'Aeon Flux' Jr - nuff said
1 ||| When I saw the trailer for "Ultraviolet," I thought: Well, here's another PG-13 movie with a slender, beautiful heroine in exotic garb in a flick made for fan boys." I was right.
2 ||| Overall, it's a film that can best be thought of as the work of a more cerebral Uwe Boll.
2 ||| This nearly incomprehensible guilty pleasure is actually a great deal of fun.
1 ||| The real blood war is between this movie and the slightly better Aeon Flux, which Wimmer plagiarizes as freely as Equilibrium plagiarized Fahrenheit 451 and The Matrix.
0 ||| The adventures of Catwoman, Elektra, Lara Croft and Aeon Flux were positively Homeric compared to this simple-minded Hi-Def tedium...
0 ||| Jovovich, who's shown sensitivity in her dramatic work, looks spectacularly bored as she power-kicks her way through one bloody pile-up after another. That boredom, like the mystery virus at the center of the film, is contagious.
2 ||| This film might actually include some of the worst deliveries that I have seen in any movie in a long time.
2 ||| Amid every action cliche in the book, outmoded stereotypes, and a plot derivative of every futuristic drama made in the last fifteen years, Ultraviolet comes off as nothing more than a pale copy of better, more inventive films.
2 ||| Ultracrappy more like.
1 ||| This is disposable cinema, to be wiped clean from the mind as soon it's over and mercifully forgotten.
2 ||| Milla Jovovich may look hot in spandex and bangs, but if you want rapidly-cut, slow-motioned-for-emphasis spectacle AND story, take in some ESPN highlights or any production by NFL Films. At least you would be getting your money's worth.
1 ||| ... inacreditável que o diretor do eficiente Equilibrium seja o responsável por uma porcaria mal roteirizada, pavorosamente dirigida, repleta de efeitos visuais capengas e péssimas atuações como esta produção.
3 ||| Ultraviolet is absolutely worth a look -- if not a listen or a thought.
1 ||| The cheesy CGI effects look like they were done on a 15-year-old Macintosh.
1 ||| The only redeeming feature is a production design so outrageously mad that you will genuinely have no idea what you're watching for more than half the time.
2 ||| Some spectacular action, though obviously digital: free of risk, free of drama.
0 ||| Lordy mama, the thing's just unspeakable.
1 ||| Just when you thought Aeon Flux couldn't have been any more rubbish, along comes Ultraviolet to prove you wrong.
1 ||| Unengaging, uninspired and unwatchable. A criminal waste of time and talent.
1 ||| Really, you can't blame Ms. Jovovich.
2 ||| Woefully nonsensical from start to finish...
1 ||| With a visual aesthetic that recalls a 1998 screensaver and a script penned by Google Translate, the film is either admirably unwatchable, contemptuously unwatchable or Vice-unwatchable. Whatever the case, it's unwatchable.
2 ||| It plays in a traditional mode of discovery, but the story is still absorbing.
4 ||| Powerful documentary, highly recommended.
3 ||| Paola di Florio's poignant documentary tells the freshly outraging story of Viola Liuzzo, a white woman who was killed while volunteering with the civil rights movement.
2 ||| There is altogether too much footage of daughter Mary wallowing in her mother's martyrdom.
4 ||| Amazing footage from the glory period of the civil rights movement energizes this documentary about Viola Gregg Liuzzo.
3 ||| Even more than a crucial piece of remedial historiography, the film is also an unsettling exploration of the impact violence and shameful injustice continue to have on a family nearly 40 years after the fact.
4 ||| Paola di Florio's haunting documentary about Viola Liuzzo, a Detroit civil rights worker murdered by the Ku Klux Klan in 1965 Alabama, adds to the case for ripping J. Edgar Hoover's name off the FBI building in Washington.
3 ||| Luc Besson's Arthur and the Invisibles clears the smog left behind by the year's dubious family entertainments.
2 ||| The routine story and lack of real warmth make this a movie to endure with one's children, not to share with them.
2 ||| Several parts of the narrative don't gel, feeling designed simply to look cool or sound funny.
2 ||| full review in Greek
2 ||| ...there's exceedingly little here to hold the interest of even the most patient adult.
1 ||| Starts off as an innocent, wholesome family adventure, but, when it becomes animated, Arthur is on the path to throwing back drinks in da club with Snoop Dogg and his posse.
2 ||| The story isn't terribly original, but Besson gives it a fuel-injected energy...
2 ||| Besson ... even dresses up the main female character in the sort of action-babe getup assigned to Milla Jovovich in his own The Fifth Element.
2 ||| Ultimately, Besson has made an interesting, if shaky in places, homage to childhood.
2 ||| Luc Besson, the most-Hollywoodish of Gallic directors, has adapted his own series of popular (in France) kid-lit tomes to produce a glossy, expensive ($84 million) and long-winded mix of live action and computer animation.
2 ||| There's no time to sort out the players or the story as things rush ahead at an overwrought pace. Huge amounts of backstory are just plopped down in front of us, so fast and furiously that it makes little sense.
3 ||| It's a pretty good picture, albeit a strange one.
2 ||| The adventure turns out to be a drag. When Arthur goes on a ruby hunt, the movie shifts to animation, and he meets the Minimoys, fairy creatures who look like those troll dolls that become inexplicably popular every 20 years.
1 ||| Arthur and the Invisibles makes an excellent case against casting animated movies with celebrity voices. There are people who make their living as voiceover artists, and they would have been infinitely better than the lackluster Robert De Niro.
2 ||| Audiences should ignore this one until Arthur becomes invisible.
2 ||| Succumbing to the in-joke trend popular in children's films, Luc Besson's visually attractive movie spoils its own fantasy spell with anachronistic references and a quickly resolved story line.
2 ||| While technically polished and adequately executed Arthur, like most of Besson's movies, is a strangely soulless experience.
1 ||| Besson is a pro when it comes to action movies, but this part live, part animation effort is a mess, highlighted by creepy animation, derivative plot points and a child star who speaks way too fast.
2 ||| The story [Besson] co-wrote for Arthur is workable, even clever at times, but the visualization of the Minimoys and their crib is weird and almost aggressively off-putting -- like an episode of When CGI Attacks!
2 ||| The film jumps and starts all over the place and simply isn't cohesive enough to appeal much beyond youngsters.
2 ||| Luc Besson serves up a hybrid of live actors and computer-generated figures to tell a not-endearing-enough story about a boy who shrinks to microscopic size to find his missing grandfather.
2 ||| Nothing in this movie works. Maybe all that tweaking helped, but I'm not betting on it.
2 ||| There's a reason American animated filmmakers don't use the great Robert De Niro, Jason Bateman and Madonna to voice their cartoons. These big names add nothing to this frustrating goulash of fairy tales and fantasy-film ingredients.
0 ||| This kids' cartoon from France is such a surreally demented attempt to connect with children that it's the equivalent of foie gras breakfast cereal or a bleu cheese milkshake.
2 ||| Good intentions, a full complement of parts, and proper assembly do not guarantee a successful result.
2 ||| It might have been just another humdrum children's film if not for Highmore, who brings the same charm he did in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Finding Neverland to this fun movie.
2 ||| Directed by Luc Besson, this inventive family movie sets up the most delightful premise, then squanders it on the kind of yawn-inducing CG adventure you might expect from one of those long, plot-heavy cut scenes that slow down video games.
2 ||| Apparently Besson became so enamored of CG animation's possibilities that he forgot basic rules ... such as the one about animation thriving on clear-cut, distinctive characters whose personalities are established in the first few seconds they're on screen.
2 ||| The movie is too long by half for its relatively simple plot. And letting kids get antsy, as any parent can tell you, is the biggest sin a filmmaker can commit.
2 ||| Arthur and the Invisibles may be a tale for children, but it's got the bad habits of a profligate adult -- the thing borrows shamelessly from its betters and then pretends to be self-sustaining.
2 ||| Too eccentric for kids, too silly for everyone else, it floats in a Neverland of breathtaking visuals in service of a story that pilfers everything (and I mean everything) from the Arthur legends to last summer's The Ant Bully.
2 ||| This fantasy blend of live-action and digital animation is just never quite as wondrous as it really should be.
2 ||| There are too many things out of whack here, and too many unanswered questions.
1 ||| Oh, what a dreaded Pandora's Box has been opened by the success of the Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings franchises.
2 ||| The movie bing-bing-bings all over the place, repurposing fantasy novels, video games, Arthurian legends. Besson's grocery bill for all I know. Even the musical score has multiple-personality disorder.
3 ||| This is no committee-engineered product designed to boost first-quarter profits; Besson actually wants to be here.
2 ||| I know this is supposed to be a children's fantasy and that the color of the Miminoys' skin should be less remarkable than their microscopic stature, but the message seems to be that an African tribe can't be cute unless it is also white.
2 ||| A movie with imaginative elements but little imagination.
2 ||| Youngsters should have a fine time. Adults not easily persuaded that any children's film is automatically charming might bring a book.
2 ||| To put it bluntly, this film has more plot holes than a Swiss cheese.
2 ||| Arthur and the Invisibles has a story so psychedelic that each movie ticket purchased should also include a black light poster and some incense. Kids weaned on the likes of Pixar and Shrek won't know what to make of it.
1 ||| Five pounds of poo in a one pound bag.
2 ||| With its Day-Glo colors and fast pace, this $80 million live action/animated film may be the first acid trip for kids.
3 ||| Whatever its flaws, Arthur and the Invisibles has a handmade, personal feel that finally affords it a cockeyed endearing quality.
1 ||| The story is just incoherent, and the faster it moves, the more frantic it seems.
2 ||| Looks like European animation is still light years behind the US and Japan. Thank goodness for Highmore and Farrow - if only the whole film had been live-action.
2 ||| Besson's labour of love is a feast for the eyes but leaves the imagination distinctly undernourished.
2 ||| Brightly coloured fantasy adventure with a decent premise, but the animated sections don't really work, despite the efforts of a talented cast.
2 ||| The Minimoys are teeny-weeny kind folk with a keen fashion sense and a wicked-cool lair. They're just like what the Borrowers would have been like if they had lived in the field behind the Urban Outfitters production factory.
1 ||| A lazy fairy-tale pastiche reveling in mite-size cherubs, which cribs from gnomic mythology, elvish lore, Harry Potter, Arthurian legend and can't-pay-the-rent melodrama.
1 ||| Here is an overproduced, oversugared semi-animated children's fantasy adventure from Luc Besson that made me want to cringe into my +h seat, never to re-emerge.
2 ||| Uma fábula divertida e inocente que conta com uma eficiente animação digital e traz Besson em um bom momento, o que é algo cada vez mais raro.
2 ||| In a clear-cut case of arrested development, the film that crowns Luc Besson's career is a magical phantasmagoria for the kids, and a derivative mess for their parents.
2 ||| Is it time for director Luc Besson to become invisible too?
2 ||| Strangely, for a feature animation aimed at a younger audience, Arthur and the Invisibles is most entertaining in its live-action sequences.
2 ||| Stevan Mena's debut film carves up body after body in a ritual homage to the serial-killer genre.
2 ||| The performances are better than one might expect from a cast of first-timers and lightly employed professionals, and Mena's characters rarely do the sort of spectacularly stupid things that provoke derisive laughter from seasoned horror-moviegoers.
2 ||| The acting and dialogue is as silly as the potato sack the killer wears on his head.
0 ||| The fanboy approach to filmmaking is always the same: Take a typical slasher-movie premise and copy all the things that impressed you when you were on the verge of puberty.
2 ||| Diehard horror fans may want to weigh in. The rest can see it soon at the video store.
1 ||| If ever a movie deserved to go directly to DVD, it's this dreary horror treatment.
1 ||| The biggest shock this old-school 35mm slasher entry provides is the fact that it didn't go directly to video.
2 ||| Many scenes on their own show some great promise. But Mena can't get his film to work as a whole.
2 ||| Basically, you begin to tick off all of the standard horror gags as they come. And they all come exactly as expected.
2 ||| ...certain sections of Malevolence are far more engaging than others, with most of the second act a complete write-off.
3 ||| Malevolence is the result of a film lover that spent their entire life striving to be the best they can.
2 ||| Apesar da trilha de filme barato e dos dez minutos finais de projeo, que escancaram a falta de experincia do diretor-roteirista, o longa  bastante eficiente em seu segundo ato.
3 ||| A low-budget, underseen genre gem that makes up for occasionally stilted dialogue and unpolished acting with a remarkable visual sense and skillful command of building tension.
3 ||| It's the multidimensional characterization and dialogue that elevates this film far far above being just a vampire movie with a more literate back-story.
1 ||| Rent The Red Shoe Diaries instead.
3 ||| Power, obsession, and death; Eternal embraces them all.
3 ||| Hope springs for "Eternal," more an erotic character study than an unsightly bloodbath.
0 ||| Lush, lurid and completely besotted with itself, Eternal is one of those movies normally found slinking around the ether of late-night cable television.
2 ||| Half real, half fantasy... not much of Eternal makes any sense at all, and Pope's police work is some of the shoddiest on screen, ever
2 ||| While Eternal starts off strong, with an intense supernatural and hyper-sexual undercurrent that's sort of interesting, by the start of the third act, Eternal slips into something near camp.
2 ||| [A] stylishly kinky exercise in blood-soaked eroticism.
2 ||| Quite silly and not especially scary.
2 ||| It's impossible to overstate the silliness of all this, but it would still be a decent Halloween trick -- if it were Halloween.
1 ||| A terrible script, pedestrian direction, and acting that's mediocre at best signify that Eternal...[is] ready-made, moderately sexy fodder for late-night Skin-emax.
1 ||| Eternal is the kind of horror movie where the only horror is a misplaced vase.
2 ||| Just by being true to the legend, as if Erszebet had truly lived, Eternal is an interesting work, an erotic thriller with a supernatural bent.
1 ||| That the acting is stilted and that the filmmakers and especially Pla take themselves so seriously serves to make Eternal deliriously silly camp fare.
2 ||| A desperate cop is in over his head under the spell of a reincarnated lesbian vampire with great hair.
2 ||| I wouldn't recommend this for theatrical viewing, but as late night cable fare, it's an acceptable way for an insomniac to pass two hours.
0 ||| There's no camp in this vamp; the lady, and the film, is a tramp.
2 ||| ...this whole production might as well just be a music video featuring everything Elizabeth from lusting for blood to bathing in it and the process involved.
1 ||| But for all its exposed skin, the film's pulse is hard to find.
2 ||| We have David O. Selznick to blame for this bloated two-hour-+ Technicolor remake.
0 ||| One of David O. Selznick's many attempts to shape his lady-love Jennifer Jones' largely immutable mug into the face that launched a thousand cinematic ships.
2 ||| This film, for all its size and color, doesn't do much more by Hemingway's book than was done by the sentimental version of it played by Helen Hayes and Gary Cooper some twenty-five years ago.
2 ||| An overblown Hollywood extravaganza that was universally condemned when first released and hasn't improved with age.
4 ||| One of the best B-movies I've ever seen, and deserves to be better known.
3 ||| A hard-as-nails, noir-ish thriller from the often underrated Richard Fleischer.
2 ||| ...a stripped-down premise that's employed to watchable yet far-from-enthralling effect...
3 ||| Surprisingly, there are a few lulls, and the closing moments lack the zest seen in these edgier films noir, even though the screenplay holds more than one brilliant twist.
3 ||| Like the down-and-out version of his Tailor of Panama character, Brosnan's performance here is a sincere treasure; possibly the most entertaining of his career.
3 ||| Brosnan and Kinnear deliver one of the most satisfying "guy movie" duos since De Niro and Grodin paired up for Midnight Run.
2 ||| Manages to transcend the cliches of its basic plotline on the strength of the character-acting so richly developed by the film's two stars.
2 ||| There's a good movie in the general proximity of The Matador, but it only crosses paths with the one you're watching in a couple of scenes.
2 ||| The Matador has that shiny sheen that quickly fades, yet is still fun while it lasts.
3 ||| ...moves at a brisk pace and features a pair of exceedingly enjoyable performances...
4 ||| Dark comedies like this one are far too rare these days.
1 ||| A painful morass of Odd Couple bickering and Elmore Leonard-style criminal kookiness.
3 ||| What emerges is a film about friendship, albeit a very unusual friendship, and Shepard fills the screen with bright, rich colours in order to keep the film visually interesting during the frequently hilarious dialogue.
2 ||| Slightly more engaging than most, even when the plot starts to stretch rather thin in the final act
2 ||| Neither challenging nor incompetent, the picture isn't courageous enough to fail and thus not courageous enough to be a masterpiece.
3 ||| Just sit back and enjoy the fun.
3 ||| The movie has a nicely modulated mix of comedy and pathos, but succeeds as much because of the two lead performances as Richard Shepard's writing and directing.
2 ||| Explores the friendship between a hit man and a suburban businessman that strains belief and leads to a totally improbable finale.
3 ||| In someone else's hands, this movie could have been terrible, but taken on by Shepard it ends up being a silly adventure bursting with quirky flavor.
3 ||| ...a captivating comedy. Brosnan gives the best performance of his career. Kinnear is a true comic genius.
3 ||| Rarely does an ensemble cast of such limited numbers create such charm and entertainment derived from plot and character.
3 ||| Shepard and his terrific cast turns a fairly simple premise into one of those rare buddy comedies that has both brains and heart!
3 ||| An effective, wise, and frequently amusing entertainment that fondly sticks in the viewer's memory after the end credits have finished rolling.
4 ||| A testament to the relatively unknown Shepard's imagination and smarts.
3 ||| Told with kinetic flair and a go-for-broke style that's more amusing than engrossing.
2 ||| Sneaky, off-beat, satirically seedy psychodrama/thriller with Pierce Brosnan as a droll, comically demented hit-man
3 ||| Going from high to low, from happiness to sorrow, Julian's business is death, and with Brosnan giving the performance of his career business isn't just booming, it's murder.
2 ||| Eventually, you forget Brosnan's ongoing effort to set fire to his trademark creased-and-polished image and begin to share his apparent glee in traipsing through this seriocomic farrago of crime melodrama, buddy movie and sob story.
3 ||| Now that hoopla surrounding the holiday blockbusters has peaked, audiences will have a better chance at not overlooking this poignant comic gem.
4 ||| Brosnan enjoys one of his best parts in years and there is no mistaking his exuberance as he embraces the role.
1 ||| Julian speaks for the film when he says, 'I'm a wreck, I'm a parody.'
3 ||| Strong chemistry between the often-underrated Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear helps turn what might have been an inconsequential genre exercise into a breezy, unexpectedly sweet odd-couple comedy.
2 ||| Pierce Brosnan plays a gold-chain-wearing sleazeball in The Matador, a weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis.
3 ||| The Matador feels like a cult gem that just might be able to target a larger audience weary of this season of self-important awards magnets.
3 ||| Funny and touching.
3 ||| Good comedy depends on surprise, and throughout The Matador I had no idea where the film was going.
4 ||| The movie's writer-director, Richard Shepard, balances the macabre and the sentimental, and understands that although his film contains questions like 'don't successful people always live with blood on their hands?' its real subject is friendship.
2 ||| Brosnan struts through the movie practically sprinkling salt on the scenery.
4 ||| Movie fans have seen any number of stories about hitmen, but it's a pretty good bet that even the most jaded of cynics will be unable to detect just where The Matador is going.
3 ||| Unevenly paced yet darkly funny and consistently intriguing.
2 ||| The Matador strives for an airy, merry amorality, but it never quite achieves liftoff, though at times it comes close.
4 ||| In The Matador, Pierce Brosnan plays another man with license to kill, yet he gives a performance wildly unlike his suave superspy. In fact, it may be his best role yet.
3 ||| This comedy is as dark as it is oddly unpredictable -- and sporadically hilarious.
3 ||| A tart comedy about economic duress and the mind-set of a soon-to-be downsized hit man, it's also a salty celebration of the romance and necessity of friendship.
2 ||| Writer-director Richard Shepard's movie is just a sweet, broadly made buddy picture that happens to look a lot like an Almodovar production.
2 ||| The Matador wants to be Sideways with two wacky guys out on a wild adventure, but the movie only has one guy funny enough to make it work.
3 ||| Writer-director Richard Shepard speeds through the hairpin turns of a pure-comedy 'what if?' premise....as quirkily suspenseful as it is ticklish.
2 ||| The film has a lot going for it, particularly Brosnan in the title role. What it does not have is much novelty.
3 ||| A slight, but amusing character-driven buddy comedy.
2 ||| Shepard's story isn't tight enough to rein in Brosnan, who's emotionally all over the map as the globetrotting assassin.
4 ||| The Matador is a superbly cast story that clearly marks Shepard as a filmmaker to watch.
2 ||| [The film] forces the viewer to work too hard to buy its buddy pairing (Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear), at times preventing the movie from being the goof it ought to be.
2 ||| It's painful to watch as the movie basically destroys itself in the second half, slipping from its elegant thriller setup to tired sitcom shenanigans.
2 ||| As exceptional as [Brosnan and Kinnear] are... writer-director Richard Shepard's film is ultimately the formula buddy picture that one would expect from the premise.
2 ||| This film is not so much a thriller as a comedy of bad manners. Action is kept to a minimum, but the conversation is what is interesting.
3 ||| Buoyant and jazzy, The Matador is like one of those '60s capers where Michael Caine was surrounded by beautiful women and Alfa Romeos.
2 ||| Brosnan and Kinnear are a bullish odd couple.
3 ||| An almost perfect mix of heartbreak and humour.
3 ||| How the two men become friends is as wildly funny as it is improbable, but that's the joy of this dark comedy.
2 ||| Never as good as you'd hoped or as bad as you'd feared, The Matador is one of those of up-and-down experiences.
3 ||| Une fort sympathique comdie dramatique sur l'amiti, les valeurs, le prix du succs et les racines des individus.
3 ||| A refreshingly tetchy indie wrapped in mainstream clothing.
2 ||| Weird, but watchable.
3 ||| Though violent and funny, and often both at the same time, the film by writer-director Richard Shepard is also a subtle and slightly skewed inversion of Brosnan's suave image.
4 ||| You've never met anybody quite like the The Matador, even though you may think you have Pierce Brosnan pegged.
3 ||| After you see this delightful black comedy about a hit man gone to seed, you'll never again pigeonhole Brosnan as a tuxedo-clad sophisticate with nerves of steel.
4 ||| Whenever you think you know where the story is headed, Shepard unleashes another hard twist. Much of his excellence comes not in his storytelling but in the way he sets up situations that ooze with comic conflict.
3 ||| This warmly-inviting black comedy plays like a David Mamet remake of Pulp Fiction.
4 ||| ... Redefines the possibilities of the buddy movie.
2 ||| ... a dark comedy that is missing the laughs to be funny and the darkness to be, well, dark.
3 ||| Kinnear and Brosnan pull it off perfectly.
4 ||| ... one of the smarter films out right now.
3 ||| ... a wicked comedy with just the mildest amount of pathos to season the blend.
3 ||| An entertaining caper anchored by great acting and a couple terrific plot twists.
2 ||| Pierce Brosnan's 'facilitator of fatalities' is a great character, but the story that houses him is as ersatz as the recording of 'In the Wee Small Hours' the assassin plays on the businessman's turntable (that's not Sinatra singing).
3 ||| You can almost feel Brosnan's glee as he allows himself to let it all hang out, both figuratively and (almost) literally.
2 ||| [It] comes across... as a somewhat incoherent story told by a stranger in a hotel lobby bar.
2 ||| A breezy entertainment -- perhaps too much so.
4 ||| Its best trait [is] the unique ability to walk the fine line, as Spinal Tap's David St. Hubbins would say, between stupid and clever.
3 ||| A constantly entertaining, invariably good-looking, bittersweet black comedy that's actually a lot more sentimental than it seems to think.
3 ||| Brosnan gives his most liberated and likeable performance since his Remington Steele days.
3 ||| It's almost as if Pierce Brosnan asked for a role as far from the debonair and cool-under-pressure James Bond as possible... and we're so glad he did.
2 ||| Brosnan walks the line between sympathy and repulsion as a cartoony lonely assassin
3 ||| The Matador is a delight. Brosnan displays a wonderful flair for comedy, while Kinnear is perfectly in tune as his shocked, straight-arrow foil.
3 ||| Even though it's a little too enamored with its edge and so obviously symbolic it could be called "The Metaphor," Brosnan is at his best, and the movie's got more on its mind than guns, giggles and a weenie-meets-warrior vibe.
4 ||| It's quirky (everyone says so, but it's absolutely accurate) and chock full of real live heart and truth and human connection.
2 ||| Pierce Brosnan oferece, aqui, um dos melhores desempenhos de sua carreira.
3 ||| Demands to be loved in spite of itself and refuses to sugar-coat its characters for its audience. And that'll make it a love it or leave it film; there'll be no sitting on the fence after seeing this.
3 ||| An amusing and original comedy that skips along with the quirky, charismatic shake-shake-shake of maracas.
3 ||| Casting Greg Kinnear (As Good As It Gets) to play the straight man to Brosnan's wacked-out whack-man was a stroke of genius.
3 ||| Brosnan is performing his own high-wire act here, daring us not to like his sleazy, vulgar, insensitive, immoral character.
2 ||| ... it does give Brosnan a chance to show his comic skills in an edgy comedy that is perhaps not dark enough for the subject matter.
3 ||| in an ideal world, The Matador would be the movie to watch on a late Friday afternoon to start relaxing for the weekend
3 ||| But the gold star here goes to Brosnan. His performance digs deep into Julian's soul and it is that depth that makes the performance stand out.
2 ||| Nice characters and situations: unfortunately, writer-director Richard Shephard didn't have much idea where to go with them.
1 ||| A chemistry-free buddy flick.
3 ||| Brosnan's work as a monster who'd like to become human, but has no idea how, is painfully funny.
2 ||| ...a hip and hilarious dark comedy.
3 ||| Brosnan's sleazy, broken-spirited hitman Julian Noble nabs the spotlight in Richard Shepard's generally pleasing comic thriller.
3 ||| Absurd and quirky at times, The Matador plays like a "Bizarro World" variation of a James Bond film. It's beautifully shot, strange and deeply meaningful.
1 ||| Smile is like a dose of cod liver oil: It may be good for you, but it's no fun.
2 ||| Overall, it's pretty elementary stuff, along the lines of a Disney Channel TV movie.
3 ||| This movie's so filled with admirable intentions that they practically spill onto the screen before it starts.
2 ||| Kramer may have felt that American audiences would have wanted to follow an American heroine, but it's Lin's story that resonates.
2 ||| Feels like a school project that has its heart in the right place if not the skills to produce something with depth and emotional heft.
2 ||| This drama, which was bankrolled by the people behind the international Operation Smile program, has the best of intentions. But it's so painfully earnest that it becomes insufferable.
2 ||| Good cause, bad movie.
2 ||| Sure, it's mushy, but you can't make a movie called Smile and not be at least a wee bit saccharine about your intentions.
2 ||| However worthy the sentiment, this one won't leave viewers with a smile.
2 ||| It's intended to puzzle us -- and sure, the little puzzles peppered throughout the film are fine. It's the grand non-sequiturs that are distracting.
2 ||| ...a strange and beautiful work, but it doesn't quite cohere.
2 ||| Seductive and emotionally charged but maddeningly elusive.
3 ||| Invisible emotional and psychological tendons are the ties that keep the film from completely dispersing into non-sequential incoherence.
4 ||| Exciting, vital cinema that pushes the boundaries of what movies can do. It's a masterpiece.
3 ||| Claire Denis's magnificent enigma of a film explores the troubled soul of a brooding loner who travels halfway around the world to begin a new life.
2 ||| [S]hould you see The Intruder? Yes -- but only if you're willing to ignore bothersome concerns about narrative and let the poetic images take over your mind.
3 ||| Characteristically impressionistic, French director Claire Denis' latest meditation is simultaneously baffling and beautiful, and definitely not for everyone.
4 ||| Denis composes a majestic dream book of shots and sequences.
4 ||| Never has Denis demanded so much from audiences as with this shimmering enigma, at once intimate and epic, but it's worth the effort and then some.
3 ||| Visually ravishing and all-but-impenetrable.
3 ||| An interior epic with epic exteriors, a film with very little dialogue, where the pictures (photographed by the great Agnès Godard), actors and the juxtaposition of both tell the story.
4 ||| Using very little dialogue, [Denis] focuses on casting a lingering, physically enticing spell.
2 ||| This is self-consciously intricate, but even if the storyline occasionally confuses, it's impossible not to admire Agnès Godard's glorious photography and the atmospheric soundtrack.
3 ||| While it may take a few viewings to sort the details out, much about L'Intrus lingers, shimmering quietly in the memory.
2 ||| yet another meandering piece of existentialism, signifying nothing except for what you're willing to project onto it.
2 ||| The first twenty minutes of Saint Ralph seem more like a primer on the up-close-and-personal art of adolescent self abuse than subtle narrative exposition.
2 ||| Thanks to the charm brought to the role of Ralph by young Adam Butcher, and strong performances from Campbell Scott, Gordon Pinsent, Jennifer Tilly and Shauna MacDonald, credibility is achieved.
3 ||| It's a heartwarming film that celebrates the healing power of innocence and faith.
2 ||| Unrepentant hokum.
2 ||| Never develops any bite or tension.
3 ||| McGowan's film isn't just about following this boy's private quest to accomplish the impossible. It is also about how he affects the other characters in the film.
2 ||| Saint Ralph is content paying lip service to Catholicism, choosing instead to pander to fans of anyone who got off during Children of Heaven and Millions.
4 ||| You might shed a few tears at the tender moments between Ralph and his comatose mother, but you'll laugh and chuckle and feel good far more often.
2 ||| An amiable sentimental fantasy, joining running, religion and a boy with a whole lot of problems into an earnest production that entertains even as it milks some of its situations for all they're worth.
1 ||| This crude, inspirational tear-jerker is as sweet as a bowl of instant oatmeal smothered in molasses.
3 ||| Written with the glee of a scheming Catholic schoolboy, but its geniality outstrips its plausibility.
4 ||| This deliciously offbeat Canadian comedy gets its charm from marvelous acting and from a screenplay bursting with ideas.
3 ||| A charmer with heart.
3 ||| Both refreshingly realistic and charmingly implausible at the same time. A real miracle, indeed.
2 ||| Light lessons about pain, endurance, and commitment...Likeable to a point, but in the end, Saint Ralph winds up incredible, manipulative, and strictly for the choir.
2 ||| Michael McGowan's direction is as flat as an asphalt road, and his script is gasping for air long before it enters the final stretch.
4 ||| A heartfelt story about a teenager who proves that ordinary individuals can do extraordinary things through strong intention and a little help from their friends.
4 ||| It's worth seeking out this bittersweet comedy with its emotionally resonant story and stellar performances.
2 ||| McGowan's film demonstrates how sometimes the strongest acts of faith can only occur entirely outside the church.
3 ||| Even when it's pushing the limits of shameless manipulation, this cheeky Canadian film has charm and wit.
2 ||| You can't argue with the message. But its well-worn homilies might give you reason to question the messenger.
2 ||| It's hard to dislike schmaltz as mild as Saint Ralph, but let's try: The film is as bland as a communion wafer, sentimental as a Christmas homily, and predictable as the liturgy.
2 ||| What began as a too familiar coming-of-age story set in an all-boys Catholic school steadily morphs into something arguably as familiar but more satisfying -- a triumphant sports tale.
2 ||| Your interest is bound to fade long before Ralph does.
2 ||| Writer-director Michael McGowan must be exhausted after all the tugging he does on our heartstrings in this sentimental drama.
3 ||| Saint Ralph sticks, for the most part, to the road less traveled, delivering a droll feel-good movie that has a little something to say about modern-day miracles.
4 ||| Writer-director Michael McGowan proves there's a reason people keep making underdog sports movies.
2 ||| As predictably uplifting movies go, Saint Ralph isn't completely charmless.
3 ||| Occasionally, a movie that makes only the faintest blip, if any, on the hype radar just shows up and gets it right.
2 ||| It's all very cute and predictable. Still it's a fun movie...
3 ||| The movie rests on (Adam) Butcher, and the actor proves to be a well-rounded smart aleck in the making.
3 ||| Ralph may be more a sinner than a saint, and his movie may be a little cheesy, but who cares - I thoroughly enjoyed following him on his quest.
2 ||| An overly convenient plot is the main con in Ralph, which includes a devastating fire, an assist from a celebrity and at least one miracle, all of which show up exactly when the plot needs help moving forward.
2 ||| Canadian writer-director Michael McGowan has packed it so full of earnestness that viewers end up jogging along.
2 ||| The comic aspects of this comedy-drama are overly broad and forced, while the supposedly dramatic ones are cloying and treacly.
2 ||| This wincingly earnest comedy-drama could rival the maple tree as Canada's leading producer of sap.
2 ||| A hooey-slathered film that combines the Catholic school humor of 'Do Black Patent Leather Shoes Really Reflect Up?' with the rah-rah uplift of an underdog sports story.
3 ||| Butcher carries the film well, interpreting Ralph as a tangle of mixed-up yearnings tempered with an indomitable drive.
3 ||| A likable little underdog-triumphs drama from Canada... This is a case where my idealistic side won out over my cynical side.
3 ||| For the jaded moviegoer, here's a little film that just might restore your faith -- in movies and a whole lot more.
2 ||| Chooses to embrace, rather than transcend via zany bawdiness, the schmaltzy genre within which it's operating.
2 ||| This romantic comedy about losers in love gave me some laughs but couldn't make me fall in love.
2 ||| promising, quite funny, but ultimately underwhelming
2 ||| A Baxter of a movie: well meaning and mildly likable, but unlikely to sweep you off your feet.
0 ||| The Baxter is more than a little out of step in a summer peppered with crude or idiosyncratic wallflower romantics.
2 ||| If [Showalter's] acting is misjudged, his direction is merely uninspired.
2 ||| Allusions to '40s screwball and later offerings like Annie Hall have a mild resonance as The Baxter struggles to get its footing.
2 ||| This wry, low-key comedy swims defiantly against the stream of contemporary comedy, eschewing bodily-function jokes and obvious gags in favor of laughs so sly and self-effacing you could almost overlook them.
3 ||| The Baxter is an ideal date movie because it's sweet, it's funny and it doesn't insult anyone's intelligence.
1 ||| The only way to even guess that humor is being attempted here is to monitor the comical faces mustered by the actors.
2 ||| There are enough laughs in it if you're willing to settle.
2 ||| Suffers from the same handicaps as its title character: it's a little too stiff, a little too timid, and it feels like it's trying a little too hard.
3 ||| the flip side of "The Graduate;" what happened to the guy jilted at the altar? ...a charming, clever, humorous, touching, intelligent comedy.
1 ||| His party-of-one status is a result entirely of his own noxiousness.
2 ||| A tender love story and a dead-on lampoon of the genre, but its main drawback is that Showalter is egregiously miscast in the title role.
3 ||| It contains a wry, throwback charm.
3 ||| Like Elliot himself, the film aspires to be no more and no less than what it is, a thoroughly charming and satisfying romantic comedy with charismatic quirkiness.
3 ||| A sweetly engaging homage to the dizzy screwball charmers of Hollywood's golden age, The Baxter is a happy surprise enlivened by its cast's appealing performances.
2 ||| What's surprising is Justin Theroux, who's actually hilarious.
1 ||| It's a terrible comedy and a worse movie, and I'm hoping, like its namesake, people leave this at the alter and look elsewhere for their entertainment. I know I wish I could have.
2 ||| Michael Showalter is a funny man, but ... how to put this gently ... not a funny movie star.
2 ||| The problem with The Baxter is right there at the center of the movie, and maybe it is unavoidable: Showalter makes too good of a baxter. He deserves to be dumped.
2 ||| Showalter's Elliot Sherman gives 40-year-old virgins a bad name (something Steve Carell has done so much to disprove).
2 ||| Starts off promising a new spin on the romantic comedy genre, and then ends up exactly like all the others.
3 ||| It's a satisfying date movie that can only be improved upon with a gromwell plant (if you don't believe that's a real plant, you can read about it in the dictionary).
2 ||| A strained affair that screams wannabe from the opening frame.
3 ||| No great shakes, The Baxter nonetheless has a quiet loopiness going for it.
2 ||| The Baxter has many of the ingredients of a good-natured indie date movie. But when the lead performance isn't one of them, it gets difficult to recommend.
2 ||| The Baxter is a self-conscious one-man show that obliterates the fine line between 'quirky' and 'annoying.'
1 ||| Conceptually...The Baxter is hobbled, and all Showalter has is his concept.
2 ||| Showalter's Elliot, self-described as the kind of guy who gets hay fever just raking the leaves, never breaks out of the Baxter clich. Frankly, he makes a pretty good case for why the sad sack never gets the girl.
2 ||| With seemingly thousands of romantic comedies to slay, Showalter wound up joining the party instead of peeing in the punch.
3 ||| There are enough laughs that those who enjoyed The 40-Year-Old Virgin might want to take The Baxter for a whirl.
2 ||| The movie is like an extremely faithful cover version of a song you like -- it adds nothing new, so what's the point?
2 ||| The biggest failing of The Baxter is that the humor is often just too obscure.
3 ||| Think of "The Baxter" as "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dumped."
2 ||| Unlike Woody Allen's nebbishes, who are always the smartest and funniest people on the screen, Elliot is a bore.
2 ||| Only when Williams is around does the movie seem human, true, and funny: Even in her slapstick there's pain. She's almost too good: It's not until she's left a scene that you realize the movie isn't working.
2 ||| Anyone who's seen a few romantic comedies, the older the better, will find something to like about The Baxter.
2 ||| Showalter tackles his mission with energy and an upbeat attitude that makes him a winner as a lovable loser.
2 ||| The structure is a miscalculation by Showalter, who inexplicably drives his audience through the exact type of sappy material he had started off satirizing.
2 ||| Clearly the filmmakers are trying to make The Baxter look old-fashioned. But there's a modern smugness and superiority that undermines that attempt.
3 ||| It doesn't take much imagination to guess who will end up with whom, but The Baxter is agreeably silly and has lots of simple charm.
2 ||| Every romantic-comedy clich gets played out, but merely re-enacting those clichs in an arch tone isn't funny enough.
2 ||| What comes to mind are TV sitcom pilots full of strain, and the forlornly perky mechanisms of old Day & Hudson comedies.
3 ||| Showalter cria um filme exatamente como seu protagonista: desajeitadamente simptico e divertido.
1 ||| A droll romantic comedy that relies on a self-deprecating brand of humor which must be a bit of an acquired taste. The film's utter predictably sinks this exercise in obviousms, making its few funny moments not worth waiting for.
3 ||| This version of Twist is a flawless adaptation; finding the right balance between story and screen. Simply enthralling.
3 ||| A version of "Oliver" that's so safe, it's pretty much a case of baby-sitting.
4 ||| Involving, captivating and nearly note perfect--in other words, a proper classic.
2 ||| It is a film where art direction triumphs but genuine art remains elusive.
2 ||| Oliver Twist isn't the nasty affair Polanski fans might be hoping for.
2 ||| It is something special in these times of incivility to see a protagonist who stands apart from others with his good manners.
3 ||| That Polanski chose this as the movie he wanted to make for his own children feels motivated by more than a septuagenarian dad's desire to take a $60-million stab at a bedtime story. It feels inspired by a need to tell them who he is.
3 ||| It still stings in unlikely places.
3 ||| With tact and enthusiasm, Roman Polanski grabs hold of a great book and rediscovers its true and enduring vitality.
2 ||| The roles must have been filled when the casting director was whacked out on prescription cough syrup.
2 ||| Polanski and his Pianist scribe Ronald Harwood have chosen to tell it in as simple a manner as possible, as though they had been given a Masterpiece Theatre assignment to dispatch.
3 ||| It's just as Dickens wrote.
2 ||| Polanski's adult fans deserve something more than a film for the kiddies, and Dickens deserves better treatment than merely 'tasteful.'
2 ||| Drab and unfeeling.
3 ||| Is it possible that a film made in 1948 and by David Lean could exceed the darkness and controversy of a Roman Polanski picture? After watching the newest screen version of Oliver Twist, the answer is yes.
2 ||| Polanski's take will spark debate among Dickens lovers, but audiences won't respond as warmly as they have to Lean's classic.
2 ||| Polanski delivers an acceptable yet thoroughly uninspiring twist on the orphaned Oliver, who gets a raw deal every which way.
2 ||| Languid and lifeless, stilted and, above all, surprisingly safe, Oliver Twist plods along, its impassive title character being tossed from one cruel fate to another.
2 ||| You can look at it all and marvel, or recoil in horror at the barbaric exploitation of women and children. But the film remains an arm's length experience.
2 ||| A work of craft that could be flying the Masterpiece Theatre banner. You know, an earnestly worthy adaptation of a literary classic, as faithful and polished as it is ponderous and unprovocative.
2 ||| Though some may quibble with the changes Polanski and scripter Ronald Harwood have made to the book, mostly they get it right.
1 ||| Polanski's take on the classic is a dull affair.
2 ||| The idea of Ben Kingsley as Fagin is such an obvious fit that he isn't surprising, nor are his acting choices
3 ||| Fails to topple Lean's untoppable version; still one of the best movies of 2005. Startlingly unemotional, but for the stormy torments behind Fagin's overhanging eyebrows.
2 ||| Roman Polanski's Oliver Twist is probably the most faithful adaptation. But hardly anyone will take notice; it's just a tale that's been told too many times before.
3 ||| Someday, this may even replace Cliff Notes for the DVD generation.
2 ||| [Polanski] takes the Dickens that screenwriter Ronald Harwood has faithfully transcribed and doesn't so much bring it to life as turn it into a handsomely mounted still life
3 ||| Kingsley's Fagin takes us on a fantastic joyride through the sleazy and disease-ridden 19th century London tenderloin and leaves everybody smiling in the end.
2 ||| Roman Polanski has made some classic films over the years, but this is not one of them.
2 ||| Oliver Twist is a rarity, as far as Polanski films go, in that it is just an OK movie.
3 ||| Roman Polanski has made a perfectly agreeable and entertaining new Oliver Twist.
3 ||| Perhaps it will take a school trip to encourage kids to see Oliver Twist, but that's one permission slip parents should sign.
3 ||| Seeing Polanski's version of this most Dickensian of all Charles Dickens' tales, I felt full and wanted no more versions (please, sir!), having now seen the definitive one.
2 ||| The film is high on production values but short on heart.
2 ||| Polanski's Oliver Twist is craftsmanly and relatively unsentimental.
3 ||| While (David) Lean's '48 Twist remains definitive, Polanski offers today's filmgoers a version nearly as rich and evocative.
2 ||| Roman Polanski's new version finds the humor in Dickens' story without glossing over the essential point that a society must be judged inhumane if its treatment of its most unfortunate members is not humane.
4 ||| Polanski's film is visually exact and detailed without being too picturesque.
1 ||| A fifth-grade puppet show of Oliver Twist would have been more watchable. And far less sickening.
2 ||| Great expectations are unavoidable when Roman Polanski takes on a Charles Dickens classic. Alas, his version of Oliver Twist fails to live up to them.
4 ||| A grounded and unusually matter-of-fact adaptation.
4 ||| Oliver Twist has been done repeatedly on film and TV, but never better than in Roman Polanski's beautiful and tough-minded movie.
3 ||| Engaging, handsomely photographed and beautifully acted, Polanski's Oliver Twist, adapted by Pianist screenwriter Ronald Harwood, distinguishes itself from most versions in its decidedly dark tone.
3 ||| Poignant and primal, Roman Polanski's splendid adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic pricks the heart and the conscience.
2 ||| In Oliver Twist, it's the viewer who is punished.
3 ||| Beauty and hateful ugliness meet in extraordinary harmony in Roman Polanski's Oliver Twist, fitting for a story that is a study in obvious contrasts.
2 ||| Oliver Twist is a lovely, tony picture, but it isn't exactly essential.
3 ||| Nitpickers may squawk over missing elements, but the film doggedly hits on the book's big themes: the power of innocence, the cruelty of class.
2 ||| The question of why anyone would bother to make another film version of `Oliver Twist' is not answered by director Roman Polanski.
3 ||| As handsomely made, well-acted, dramatically unflinching and heartfelt as it is, Polanski's Oliver is a movie more admirable than emotionally affecting.
2 ||| With the story lines streamlined and compressed, the whole thing doesn't have nearly the emotional heft it probably should.
2 ||| Polanski could have made Oliver as haunting as his 2002 Academy Award-winning film, The Pianist. Yet his new effort falls just short.
3 ||| Hopefully, this loving adaptation will allow a new generation to discover this masterpiece.
2 ||| It's as though Polanski had set the story's foolproof motor on cruise control and left the room; the tale is well told but told without personality.
2 ||| Please sir, can I have some more... levity with my poverty and abject misery. This bleak story could benefit from some musical numbers to break up the monotony of sorrow.
2 ||| A film that's stately in its production but moves as if walking through thick gruel.
2 ||| Yet given previous versions... there ought to be something new here to warrant retelling. There isn't.
2 ||| Technically sound and surprisingly faithful to its source material, Roman Polanski's version of Oliver Twist comes across as uninspired and flat.
2 ||| Is it worth renting the video sometime in the spring so the little darlings can cheat on their book report? Perhaps, as it's unusually faithful to the original source.
3 ||| Ben Kingsley finally recaptures his dignity after the trifecta of awfulness that was Thunderbirds, Suspect Zero, and A Sound of Thunder.
2 ||| Dickens was a better social chronicler than storyteller, and Polanski has chosen to adopt that weakness in the interests of utter faithfulness to the text.
3 ||| The sad thing is that this really is a very fine film. Yet, at the end of the day, it's still Oliver Twist.
4 ||| Why, oh why, wasn't this movie released at Christmas time?
2 ||| Please sir, can we have some less?
2 ||| As much as I'm loath to say it, this is one literary adaptation where I can sadly say with certainty I do not want more.
3 ||| There's also strong support from Harry Eden, as well as Leanne Rowe as the archetypal tart-with-a-heart Nancy, whilst Jamie Foreman (nasty pieces of work a specialty) adds another great performance to his rogue's gallery of Cockney villains.
4 ||| It's not Dickens and it's not David Lean, either. This perverse retelling of a classic could only be the work of one filmmaker that I can think of. It's my boy Polanski.
3 ||| Polanski tactfully stays out of Charles Dickens' way.
3 ||| Despite the length, you'll never fault the film's craftsmanship.
2 ||| Polanski's deft adaptation proves that there's still life in that well-worn story of a boy who beats the odds.
4 ||| (Roman) Polanski orchestrates this well-worn chestnut with the same high level of expertise that won him an Oscar for The Pianist in 2002.
2 ||| Falha ao jamais encontrar um tom adequado para sua narrativa: em certos momentos,  excessivamente infantil; em outros, sombrio demais.
4 ||| A severely overlooked, exceedingly well-done version of an oft-told tale...One of the best films of 2005.
3 ||| It just might supplant David Lean's 1948 version as the one that students turn to for a 2-hour study guide.
3 ||| With intelligence and style (inspired by the art of Gustave Dor and Francisco Sol), Polanski makes a rewarding contribution to Dickens' legacy on screen.
2 ||| It's a respectful and respectable version of the story, albeit just a wee bit overlong.
2 ||| Polanski's film is not a bad adaptation, and it may be a fine way to introduce children to the classic story. But it is not exactly a definitive version of that story.
3 ||| Oliver Twist is an affecting and refreshing adaptation of Dickens seminal work from a master director.
3 ||| A smorgasbord of urban decay, social disorder, and class conflict imbues the film with a potent sensuality
2 ||| Polanski and Harwood have streamlined the meandering narrative to Dickens' second novel, which may horrify purists, but which works well enough for the filmmakers' purposes.
2 ||| Wildly overwrought, clumsy, and embarassingly directed.
3 ||| Duke does Alamo redux. Heroic, overblown, speechy.
2 ||| As his own producer and director, Mr. Wayne has unfortunately let his desire to make a "big" picture burden him with dialogue. His action scenes are usually vivid, his talk scenes are long and usually dull.
3 ||| All the pontificating about the joys of freedom becomes irritating, but James Edward Grant's dialogue occasionally crackles with enough humorous wit to hold an audience untill the gripping finale.
2 ||| The producers may be right to bemoan Hollywood's myopia; but it's the movie's execution, not its vision of an alternative African-American cinema, that delayed its release.
1 ||| The decadent world of Hamptonite hip-hop moguls is a fitting backdrop for this somewhat faithful but not very graceful retelling of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'Great Gatsby.'
2 ||| The filmmakers are going for something operatic here with their mix of love and loss, rap and race. They miss. By a lot.
2 ||| Fails both as an update of F. Scott Fitzgerald's dissection of American aspirations and class barriers and on its own boorish terms.
2 ||| The problem with G is not merely that the ending doesn't work and feels hopelessly contrived. It's also that the plot adds too many unnecessary characters and subplots, so that the main line gets misplaced.
3 ||| An unpolished but entertaining tragedy filled with outstanding performances and memorable moments.
2 ||| You should never make a movie about boundless, conspicuous wealth on an indie budget.
2 ||| We beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the sha-fizzle-dizzle.
1 ||| [A] poorly acted, directed and written (but slick-looking) vanity project.
3 ||| Bottom line: It works even if you've never heard of F. Scott Fitzgerald. But it's twice as much fun if you have.
2 ||| The women are shrewishly materialistic, the men are manipulative or violent and the Polo wardrobes look fabulous on everyone. It's an ugly affair overall, but at least you can say you've never seen such beautiful shirts.
2 ||| The book was about class and the American dream. The movie is too, though it's most interested in the soap opera machinations of the plot.
2 ||| Christopher Scott Cherot's drama is an honorable attempt laid low by a verbose script, cheap production values, and a general tendency toward soap opera.
2 ||| G often resembles a glossy BET soap opera...Cherot does capture the decadence of its slick "playas" in the extravagant world of bling-worshipping music moguls
2 ||| Reworking the story with a hip-hop record mogul at its center comes across as little more than a stunt. And not a very good stunt.
4 ||| The F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic, The Great Gatsby, adapted as a modern-day morality play in blackface. This fairly-faithful version explores the same themes as its source material, only with a hip-hop spin.
2 ||| a colossal bore
1 ||| ...even more ineffectual and dull than Oliver Stone's recent attempt.
2 ||| The most notable battle on view in this picture isn't any of the skirmishes between Alexander's army and the opposing forces but the effort between Burton's blonde wig and March's shaggy beard to upstage each other in grievous grooming.
2 ||| The question the film asks is, "Why not?" Surely life is to be enjoyed? The answer is grimmer than you expect.
3 ||| A minor British classic and a valuable record of the hedonistic Swinging 60s.
3 ||| The real strength, and the reason to see it, is the great performances from everyone involved.
3 ||| Essential 60s Michael Caine.
3 ||| Caine's terrific performance makes a viewer almost forget that the film is actually a condemnation of its character's swinging lifestyle.
3 ||| Interestingly, the film's first person narration inclines us to relate to and identify with the protagonist, and for much of the film you like the man despite his faults.
3 ||| Caine does a wonderful job of building and maintaining sympathy for his arrant, arrogant character, despite his obvious brutishness.
4 ||| It put Michael Caine on the movie star map, deservedly so.
4 ||| Caine does such a flawless job in the role that he alone makes the film.
4 ||| Michael Caine's breakout performance is awesome.
3 ||| Michael Caine gives a bravura, career-making and Oscar-nominated, performance as a Cockney Don Juan, who's by turns weak and endearing, charming and despicable, but the film has aged badly.
4 ||| Alfie (Michael Caine) is more than just a perpetual bachelor; he's a ladies' man, a cad, a man about town. Put bluntly: Alfie loves to have sex. He meets women and takes what he wants from them: pleasure. But behind him, Alfie is leaving a trail of misery
4 ||| In its time, the film was praised for its sexual frankness and persuasive rendering of Swinging London; both seem quaint by contemporary standards. Caine's Cockney Don Juan, however, is sui generis.
4 ||| Though it's very much a product of its time, Alfie has aged well because it's a funny, sad and insightful look at an eternal struggle.
2 ||| ...unlikely to find much of an audience outside of the film festival circuit.
2 ||| Seems rather a waste to use name actors and then not have them actually do anything.
3 ||| Writer/ director Joshua Michael Stern has crafted something more than a mess and something less than a film that hits home. Neverwas never does quite win us over.
2 ||| Never has so much talent come to so little because of a screenplay that's so adrift and aimless. Eckhart plays a psychologist with enough personal psychoses to keep himself preoccupied for a lifetime.
2 ||| Startlingly direct, if unavoidably preachy, The Second Chance takes aim at Christianity's racial divide and the corporatization of faith.
2 ||| There are a lot of good messages in The Second Chance about how Christianity is a mix of love, both gentle and tough.
2 ||| It is earnest, cliched, often awkward and unlikely to inspire anyone who isn't already thoroughly sold on its message of salvation through community activism.
2 ||| [The film is] designed to launch Christian pop singer Michael W. Smith as a movie brand name. It doesn't really succeed at that, but it does manage to send a positive message in a pretty polished movie, a message aimed at regular church-goers.
2 ||| [The film is] sabotaged by hackneyed dialogue, sluggish pacing and a listless performance by Smith, who only springs to life when he's singing.
2 ||| A movie-of-the-week treatment of race and class, the film credibly portrays the day-to-day workings of an urban ministry.
3 ||| Second Chance delivers its parable of spiritual growth with enough tender nuance that it doesn't merely preach to the choir.
3 ||| This may be a church movie, but it's one of the better ones.
1 ||| A modern morality play whose positive messages are undercut by its pandering, paternalistic tone.
3 ||| The end result is that rare Christian film that garners a PG-13 rating for its realistic portrayals of violence and conflict.
3 ||| With no common language, these two connect instantly -- perhaps it's the blood -- and embark on an emotionally wrenching journey in this visually appealing, occasionally heavy-handed thriller from Paula van der Oest.
3 ||| In this English-language Dutch thriller, a 13-year-old girl and a young Afghan drug courier fall in love while fleeing his employers.
2 ||| A pretty daring -- and disconcerting -- depiction of adolescent sexuality.
3 ||| Moonlight is a disturbing and daring thriller with an exceptional performance by 13-year-old Laurien Van den Broeck.
2 ||| A wild dream that spins into a nightmare, Moonlight isn't quite as provocative as it aims to be.
2 ||| There's an air of prefab provocation about the whole thing, and viewers should know that the director has a penchant for squirm-inducing images, not all of them strictly necessary.
4 ||| When it comes to the logical marriage of action, adventure, and science fiction, few films are as effective or accomplished as Aliens.
4 ||| The ads for Aliens claim that this movie will frighten you as few movies have, and, for once, the ads don't lie.
4 ||| Aliens is an exercise in film craftsmanship that has rarely been equaled in the twelve years since its release.
4 ||| [An] instant cult classic.
4 ||| This is what this film does to you: it leaves you completely drained, just like the characters in this movie. Some say that the fact that this is exhausting is a major flaw; I say it's ingenius filmmaking, not a shock from James Cameron.
4 ||| Blockbuster combination of blistering action, smart sci-fi and gooey monsters.
4 ||| the ultimate science fiction war epic
4 ||| Where Alien was largely a gothic horror flick, packed with suspense, Aliens is an action adventure, loaded with thrills. (Alien Quadrilogy)
3 ||| One of the few films that can be predicted perfectly, but it's so well crafted -- and so damn exciting -- that we just don't care.
4 ||| How can I put into worlds the terrifying atmosphere, the in-your-face violence or the nerve-wrenching suspense of the film?
4 ||| An extraordinary film.
2 ||| At first it's exciting, then it keeps going and going and going...
4 ||| A movie experience that sticks with you and begs for numerous revisits . . . the kind of film that marks career milestones and re-defines genres.
3 ||| Other than being overlong, this film is damn near perfect.
4 ||| The most instense and satisfying piece of science fiction ever made. James Cameron's masterpiece.
4 ||| What happens when you take a premise, soak it in a combination of adrenaline and kerosene, then light the sucker.
4 ||| Aliens never strives to be as accomplished as the original, but it's wit and turbo-charged battles make it a wild and electric ride, one with the best replay value of the franchise.
3 ||| [A] modern sci-fi classic.
2 ||| The Director's Cut of the film hauntingly amplifies Ripley's disconnect from her dead daughter and her relationship to the young Newt.
2 ||| Features Sigourney Weaver as a female Rambo with nurturing instincts.
4 ||| Everything a sequel should be.
4 ||| It's actually scary to think about what the movie landscape would look like had Aliens not been the critical and commercial success that it was.
4 ||| Truly great cinema.
4 ||| If only all blockbusters were this good.
4 ||| Weaver is superb -- tough, smart, and the best fighter, male or female, in the movie.
3 ||| Un film clé en son genre.
4 ||| If you were to only see one movie in your entire lifetime it would have to be ALIENS. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece that will never in a million years be topped...
4 ||| Proved that James Cameron has a mind for directing action movies considerably more nuanced and plot-driven than just "find ways to blow things up".
4 ||| It's interesting that the film, a sequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 atmospheric horror-film-in-space, is generally regarded as an action movie. Go through it, and you'll realize the character and dialogue scenes far outweigh the kablooey stuff.
2 ||| Alien sequel is bigger, faster, scarier.
4 ||| James Cameron's Aliens is easily one of the best sequels ever made, taking the original story and expanding upon it in ways most sequels are afraid to do.
4 ||| Aliens contains a fascinating exploration of the way Western culture has traditionally aligned feminine characteristics onto nature while masculine characteristics have been aligned with civilisation.
4 ||| Another defining picture in the sci-fi genre. A stellar achievement that's almost as good as the original.
2 ||| Count me out of the fan club for this one.
4 ||| On the short list of sequels that not only matched the quality of its predecessor, but arguably surpassed it to become one of the greatest films of its genre.
3 ||| [Aliens] is a spectacular example of state-of-the-art science fiction simply because it never tries to be overtly spectacular.
4 ||| Surpassing its predecessor in terms of sheer spectacle, this sequel to Ridley Scott's outer-space nightmare from director James Cameron is an outstanding science-fiction thriller.
4 ||| The first of these movies remains one of the great sci-fi horror achievements of the modern cinema, but its sequel, "Aliens," is that rare instance where a follow-up deviates from the formula and finds an effective rhythm in propelling the story
4 ||| Scene to scene, encounter to encounter, its tension builds unrelentingly. So, fasten your seat belts. It`s a blast.
4 ||| A subtle, spooky movie with teeth becomes a subtlety-bashing war movie.
4 ||| An excellent science fiction, horror, action AND war film.
3 ||| Cameron's film is a lot of fun for what it is, a bonanza of brash action sequences and delicious camaraderie. It proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that while nobody can hear you scream in space, they can certainly hear you shoot.
4 ||| It's so rare to see a sequel live up and maybe surpass (depending on if you like your horror with plenty of action or not) the original, but Aliens does...
3 ||| Eschewing the claustrophobic foreboding of Alien, Cameron takes all the anxieties and fears that had been built in the original and refracts it through his action movie sensibilities to create a smart action thriller.
4 ||| An often astonishingly engaging and entertaining sequel...
4 ||| Perhaps the greatest exemplar of science-fiction, action, and horror faultlessly blended together into one film.
2 ||| [Director] Gutierrez sustains a heightened mood of sex and violence that, without breaking new ground, entertains in the way Gothic flicks do: a combination of cheap thrills and a good old-fashioned crusade against evil.
2 ||| You can thank a capable cast led by the estimable Lucy Liu, and work by writer/director Sebastian Gutierrez that succeeds in making the formulaic seem fresh.
1 ||| There are worse things than waking up in a morgue. Like, say, waking up and realizing there's another hour of Rise: Blood Hunter to go.
2 ||| A dry and dreary little affair, one that's almost shamefully beholden to B-flicks that are a lot more energetic and a lot less intent on being taken so seriously.
2 ||| It's a blood-red affair thrown together in a dash, a little number that will ultimately get the same kind of treatment from audiences as it did from those who made it: something you might cue up in the DVD player on a whim and forget just as easily.
3 ||| ...a far more effective piece of work than one might've expected...
3 ||| far from perfect, but it's better than most direct-to-video horror you'll find out there. Heck, it's better than some of the theatrical releases we've seen this year
2 ||| While Rise: Blood Hunter isn't a terrible film, it's a predictable one.
1 ||| A tedious Blade rip-off. No suspense or scares, but lots of boredom.
1 ||| Torturous vampire bloodbath is a waste for all.
4 ||| The film is filled with a nice dark humor that is rare for the I-Like-Ike decade of filmmaking.
4 ||| All About Eve is a film that you see completely differently once you know what's going to happen.
4 ||| While its attitudes toward women are dated, its wit and perceptiveness are as fresh today as they were in 1950.
4 ||| The screenplay... may be the most biting example of hard-boiled wit ever to come out of Hollywood, and it is stylishly performed at a breakneck pace by a uniformly expert cast.
4 ||| It's about the glory of acting.
4 ||| One of the best send-ups of the inside back-stabbing and infighting that goes on in Hollywood ever put to film.
3 ||| Boffo look at the backstabbing backstage world of Broadway
4 ||| With a towering, self-mocking performance by Ms. Davis...the satire remains as entertaining today, and as relevant, as ever before.
4 ||| A motion picture that, because of its priceless dialogue and unforgettable lead performance, will never lose its luster.
4 ||| Outstanding Mankiewicz film with the perfect cast.
4 ||| Poucos roteiros, em toda a Histria do Cinema, conseguiram reunir tantos dilogos memorveis.
3 ||| Forget Foreman vs. Ali, this is Baxter vs. Davis in one of Hollywood's greatest showdowns.
4 ||| Amazing performances top the list of positive qualities in Joseph L Mankiewicz' All About Eve.
4 ||| Intelligent script ... mesmerizing performances
4 ||| Apart from the monochrome photography, all that dates the film is the chain-smoking and the fact that these are theatre folk rather than movie stars (frequent in-jokes about the low art of Hollywood pepper the script).
4 ||| For old-school Hollywood movie-making at its most polished, literate and sophisticated there is really nothing to match it.
4 ||| Put simply, one of the greatest movies ever made.
4 ||| Here is a real Christmas treat: a restored version of Joseph L Mankiewicz's jet-black 1950 comedy about Margo Channing, elegant leading lady of the theatre, superbly played by Bette Davis.
3 ||| A total joy.
4 ||| One of Hollywood's finest backstage dramas. If nothing else Davis should have been rewarded for services to the tobacco industry.
4 ||| Sanders...was ideally cast in this role: you can feel in Addison's every word the world-weariness of the actor who would eventually commit suicide at age 65...
4 ||| Classic movie about an ambitious woman.
4 ||| In our celebrity-obsessed culture, it's possible that All About Eve is more important than ever. Scratch that. How about it's more entertaining than ever?
4 ||| Mankiewicz's inside knowledge of show business and its particular personality types gives the film an authenticity and allows for its famously devastating acid wit. [Blu-ray]
4 ||| Bette Davis is fabulous in this role.
3 ||| All About Eve is deliciously fun to watch with characters playing versions of themselves (most noticeably Bette Davis) and being quite introspective for its day.
4 ||| A classic movie, whose qualities remind us that there once was a Hollywood where such sophisticated treats could be made.
4 ||| All About Eve is not only a brilliant and clever portrait of an actress, it is a downright funny film, from its opening scene to the final fadeout.
4 ||| Joseph L Mankiewicz's film dissects the narcissism and hypocrisy of the spotlight as sharply as [Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd], but pays equal attention to the challenges of enacting womanhood.
4 ||| One of the greatest films of post-WWII Hollywood.
4 ||| Bette Davis is most certainly at the top of her game playing the crowd favourite Margo Channing,...
4 ||| Writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's enduring masterpiece -- and, incidentally, my all-time favorite film.
4 ||| a smart, insightful, and darkly humorous drama about the intersections of art and show business and that insatiable appetite we call ambition
4 ||| Betty Davis gives the finest performance of her career. If there was ever any doubt in your mind that she was one of the greatest of screen actresses, her performance here will dissipate ail doubt.
3 ||| Acridly cynical (realizing Addison's self-proclaimed contempt for humanity, coupled with insatiable ambition) and somewhat unpleasant, yet highly influential.
4 ||| The kind of dialogue actors kill for.
1 ||| Making The Family Stone's shenanigans and schmaltz seem downright sophisticated by comparison, Salvador Litvak's Passover-themed film gives Jews an insufferable holiday family comedy to call their own.
2 ||| When Do We Eat? takes place before, during and after a Passover Seder. But you don't have to be Jewish to savor this light and enjoyable comedy.
1 ||| In this distasteful film from Salvador Litvak, a Jewish family tries to race through a Seder, but drug use, possible incest and some jokes at the expense of the autistic slow them down.
2 ||| Though the script never rises above sitcom-style one-liners and sight gags, strong performances invest both the jokes and the syrupy moments of forgiveness and reconciliation with no small measure of, yes, heart.
2 ||| While it does have some sweet moments and a handful of zingy one-liners, the film all too often resembles a trite dinner theater play that's been minimally 'opened up' for the screen.
2 ||| When Do We Eat? is as imperfect as the Stuckmans' Seder, yet it has some decent punchlines, a strong cast and a good heart.
2 ||| Cliches and loud stereotypes as fresh as year-old matzoh infest When Do We Eat?, a farce about a wildly dysfunctional Los Angeles family's disastrous Passover Seder.
2 ||| A self-consciously zany dysfunctional family comedy, When Do We Eat? strains so hard to be outrageous that it sacrifices characters for caricatures. They might have had something if they'd let everybody relax, be themselves and enjoy dinner.
3 ||| When Do We Eat? is about as funny, emotionally satisfying and even spiritually significant as this type of thing gets.
2 ||| [Director] Litvak crams so many earth-shattering revelations and long-buried resentments into 93 minutes that the film feels as if it's struggling to provide something recognizable to every potential ticket buyer.
2 ||| When Do We Eat? isn't a great film or, necessarily, a particularly good one, but it's a worthy attempt at making an entertaining movie about faith.
2 ||| Not recomended for the Goyim.
1 ||| It borders on painful to see this cast go through the motions of this uninspired script.
2 ||| Watching this movie is kind of like being sprayed with emotional vomit.
3 ||| Its strong cast is loud and lively, and the bickering banter has snap and drive.
1 ||| Crass, chaotic comedy.
2 ||| The movie's most distinctive feature is its cast, which has the fake lived-in comfort of a TV clan.
3 ||| A haunting and disturbing film.
2 ||| Litvak's movie almost immediately barges across the line separating the comically absurd from the outright obnoxious.
2 ||| Thanks to a great cast and sharp writing, When Do We Eat? is a clever comedy with plenty of black humour and irreverence, all of which leads to contemplative thought.
2 ||| Manages to be broad, mawkish and mean-spirited all at once.
2 ||| even with all the strange impractical goings on, as with all in this recent string of popular entertainment culled from authentic orthodoxy, there are moments of sheer breathtaking joy that elevate the spirit of a Jew by speaking to their core.
2 ||| We're basically left with a wild-eyed group of actors who probably had a lot more fun shooting When Do We Eat? than they did watching it.
2 ||| The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Then Green is another step back for the gay community.
1 ||| The mostly unfunny -- and unfabulous -- trifle never rises above sitcom level.
2 ||| A bit like staring at a beauty queen's phonily tight smile for ninety minutes.
2 ||| Remarkably true to its source: It's none too deep and a tad cartoonish, but also fast-paced, filled with quotable one-liners and often very funny.
2 ||| This bright, fast-paced adaptation of Eric Orner's syndicated gay comic strip may not break any new cinematic ground, but its sharp, zingy wit and underlying sweetness deftly compensate for the occasional awkward patch or glaring narrative contrivance.
1 ||| There's so much ill-conceived fluff floating about the 'elusive true love' themes that by the finish, Ethan Green hasn't as much substance as a good Looney Tunes.
2 ||| Not un-entertaining, but director George Bamer's debut feature may play better on video.
2 ||| Ethan Green may not exactly be fabulous, but it is pleasantly diverting.
0 ||| 'I'm 19, but I'm petulant' somehow sums it up.
1 ||| With words streaming out of their mouths instead of into bubbles, Ethan and his gang of past, present and future lovers sound laughingly unbelievable.
3 ||| No, he doesn't have anything terribly important, or even original to say, but he's funny, flighty and adorable, sort of like a gay Holly Golightly.
2 ||| The film's tone veers from misjudged sincerity to shrill sketch comedy of the broadest stripe.
2 ||| In his directing debut, David Vernon, formerly a first assistant and second assistant director, opts for the look of a cable TV pilot.
2 ||| This feels like a school play that someone has dragged to film school and turned into a final project.
1 ||| With its unpleasant characters, inconsistent script and awkward acting, what's not to hate?
2 ||| The title does its own summing up: mostly, it's unfab.
2 ||| Tiresome romantic comedy that reinforces every imaginable gay stereotype.
2 ||| George Bamber's film is bouncy and agreeable but has a certain flatness to it; never making the case for its existence as a movie rather than a comic strip.
2 ||| There's just not enough real heart to go along with the cutesiness.
2 ||| Not entirely successful, but it's as twisted as a James Ellroy novel, and it may please genre fans who don't require the transubstantiation of spilled blood into the holy water of redemption.
1 ||| Chris Fisher's Dirty is clumsier and less earnest than Crash, but it's every bit as totalitarian.
0 ||| It is so biased that it doesn't inspire the outrage that Fisher obviously intended.
0 ||| Another Cuba Gooding Jr. dud. Don't show him the money -- show him the door!
2 ||| Cuba Gooding Jr. sheds the halo that has threated to strangle his career by playing a corrupt cop in a nasty little genre film set in Los Angeles.
3 ||| It makes Training Day seem like a film about good citizenship, but Dirty is also a luxury vehicle for two actors whose every appearance on screen is a boon.
2 ||| The cinematography of Eliot Rockett is also laudable: The city is not only rendered in the usual hot and gritty texture of urban landscapes, but is imbued with sense of oppression that is palpable.
2 ||| Even the stunningly downbeat ending smacks of sub-Tarantinoesque theatrics.
2 ||| This isn't a film made by someone who knows anything about cops. It's a film made by someone who's seen a lot of cop movies.
2 ||| The machinations of the plot are so murky as to be not worth following.
0 ||| The only suspense is how long it's going to take for this movie to finally drag to an end.
2 ||| As good as the leads and the supporting cast are, and as much action as gets packed into the film's relatively brief running time, none of it draws us in dramatically.
2 ||| Capturing LA as a sepia-toned, sunbaked wasteland just isn't fresh. Why must every LA cop drama take place on the hottest day of the year just as the city is about to explode?
2 ||| DIRTY boasts about a wayward police drama that needs considerable conscientious washing. Sadly, this perfunctory scrub job simply attacks the same old neglected stained areas.
2 ||| ...although Dirty isn't much better than some of his earlier efforts, one can't help but admire Gooding Jr's willingness to portray such an irredeemably nasty character.
1 ||| This picture of it is poppin' blanks at too many turns to be considered honest nor a reflection of the real deal.
0 ||| A complete cinematic joke.
3 ||| While the plot device is quite innovative, the execution remains pretty true to the PG-13 thriller formula.
2 ||| The movie equivalent of junk food: It's not good, but it's predictable and even satisfying, in a low-expectations way.
1 ||| Dead on arrival.
1 ||| What will terrify the audience very early on is the realization that there's better acting in the video game than on the big screen.
1 ||| It's amazing how little Stay Alive actually knows about the videogame culture in which its terror-lite tale is set.
2 ||| Stay Alive isn't a total wash if you're looking to kill a Saturday afternoon or night if you get off on hearing little kids scream.
1 ||| makes minimal sense, displays minimal style, and provides minimal entertainment
2 ||| With all the gamer product endorsements (Alienware, PS2), you'd think they could afford someone to write a better ending for a decent idea.
1 ||| It's unlikely that Stay Alive could ever have been a good movie in the traditional sense, but it might have been better if Bell and co-writer Matthew Peterman had done more to exploit their gaming premise.
2 ||| It's too tame to be scary and too silly to take seriously. What it does seriously is waste time, which is fine if you really don't have anything better to do, like, say, count cracks in the sidewalk.
1 ||| Perhaps the worst horror film to not have Uwe Boll's name in the credits.
1 ||| The star of Stay Alive is a cutting-edge video game, but the film still has hackneyed horror at its heart.
1 ||| This movie will bore you to death
0 ||| A notion of an outline of a rough draft of a killer video-game flick.
2 ||| There's a fascinating and terrifying story to be told about Elizabeth Bathory, the dramatically depraved 17th century sadist known as the Blood Countess. This ain't it.
2 ||| Here's a movie that tries to be a video game but is less entertaining than a vending machine.
2 ||| The hybrid of cyber antics and bayou creepiness doesn't quite jell, but it all ends bloodily, and in an efficient 85 minutes, too. I'm not complaining.
2 ||| Really silly, but there's nothing inherently unlikable about the movie's silliness.
2 ||| A typical offering in the PG-13 horror-movie genre, "Stay Alive" won't surprise anybody, especially the young demographic toward which it is aimed.
1 ||| Since the director and co-writer William Brent Bell does little to contrast the contrived and mechanical horror of the game with the mounting horror of the story, we can't invest much sympathy in the plight of the characters.
1 ||| Seriously, Bell, answer me something: does the game kill you when you die on the game? Does the game kill you because you have it in your possession? Or does the game kill you period because you played it? Which is it?
0 ||| Boring!!!
2 ||| The bloody 16th Century saga of Hungary's Countess Elizabeth Bathory is transported to pre-Katrina New Orleans in this occasionally spooky but cheap and inconsequential thriller.
0 ||| The filmmakers are so at a loss for fresh ways to shock that they even dredge up the twitchy, girl-with-hair-hanging-in-her-face trick from The Ring and The Grudge.
0 ||| Implausibly tedious, Stay Alive has none of the vicarious thrills of, say, Konami's Silent Hill 2. It's barely even Pong unplugged.
1 ||| Never mind staying alive. You'd be doing well to simply stay awake through all 85 interminably inert minutes of Stay Alive.
1 ||| The dialogue seldom rises above the level of twaddle -- unspeakable in every sense of the word.
2 ||| A lack of logic infects this film like a virus.
1 ||| Stuttering like a busted console, the film's lack of invention is only rivalled by a paucity of gore which will seem positively comical to gamers long since inured to cyberspace slaughter.
2 ||| Something of a disappointment and nowhere near as scary as The Ring, which it rips off shamelessly.
1 ||| A cool idea rapidly falls apart. A completely missed opportunity.
1 ||| Never has a title been more horribly at odds with the way you're actually going to feel while watching the movie.
2 ||| ...if the filmmakers could have dispensed with the actors and plot altogether, they might have had a better movie.
2 ||| - Aspirante a Terror em Silent Hill (jogo e filme) que, repleto de clichs e personagens caricaturais, revela-se apenas cansativo e previsvel.

2 ||| ...a little needless brutality would've almost certainly elevated the proceedings, albeit temporarily...
3 ||| Yeah, the plot sounds like utter nonsense, but it's fun.
4 ||| Steve Martin's brilliant physical comedy is only the highlight of this satisfying little giggle-fest.
2 ||| A decent diversion, but a largely forgettable film. Martin and Tomlin try hard, but don't get as many laughs as they should.
3 ||| A wonderful showcase for Steve Martin's physical talents, and Lily Tomlin is a scream.
3 ||| One of Steve Martin's best performances.
4 ||| Beatiful comedy. Martin acts half-man/half-woman perfectly. Biting cross-gender comedy here.
4 ||| "All of me" is very funny, but not too outlandish, risque (at times) but not disgusting. A quality comedy with a heart.
2 ||| Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin showcase their comic zest.
4 ||| It scores a lot of points by speculating on the ways in which a man and a woman could learn to coexist in such close quarters. Against all the odds, a certain tenderness and sweetness develops by the end of the film.
3 ||| Steve Martin delivers a marvelous, physically challenging performance in this often hilarious comedy.
2 ||| Martin does some of his best acting in this film and steals the movie from Tomlin, whose character is, at best, a one-note creation.
3 ||| ...one could not hope for more humor than from this unassuming title.
2 ||| A lewd, loveable comedy for teens and up.
3 ||| Timeless, indelible and irrefutable proof that Steve Martin is not just among the funniest men alive. He's one of the most thoughtfully funny men alive. Plus, Carl Reiner's devilishly deft touch makes this feel appropriately like 1984 by way of 1944.
2 ||| ...a decidedly out-there premise that's employed to watchable yet far-from-memorable effect by filmmaker Carl Reiner...
3 ||| After all the put-upon jokes about trailer trash, finally here is a place where the terminology of community really defines itself.
2 ||| The gossamer spell is undone when the script topples into melodrama and then a too-tidy resolution.
2 ||| The awe-inspiring New Mexico scenery and light and the performance of lead actress Agnes Bruckner lift this teen drama above the usual fare.
3 ||| The filmmakers were clearly not interested in the ending but in exploring the characters and the situation, and they do that with sophistication and genuine feeling, both for the people and the environment.
2 ||| As swoony and verbose and serious as an adolescent's journal entry.
2 ||| The performances are all fine, with Bruckner and Corbett the standouts as a parent and child with roles reversed after a death in the family.
2 ||| a long way to go for such a tepid lesson
3 ||| ...there's little doubt that the film heralds the arrival of a promising new director.
2 ||| The cast is solid, the characters fascinating, the direction notable, the story shaky.
2 ||| Nowhere near as probing as it could or should be. Valuable points are blunted by too many talking heads.
2 ||| There is obviously a serious imbalance here and even if the filmmakers don't get the complete picture, they at least make a case for the farmers themselves.
2 ||| Black Gold, a compelling documentary about the international coffee industry, might discourage you from ever drinking a cup of joe again. At the very least, it'll make you think deeply about what's going into that cup.
3 ||| A film to think about every time you order a Triple Grande Soy Latte.
2 ||| ...gorgeously-shot, melancholy.
2 ||| The film raises issues that were mere sound bites during the 2005 G8 Summit. All that's missing is Bono's seal of approval.
2 ||| A beautifully made, provocative and very righteous documentary.
3 ||| The documentary Black Gold tells an unresolved modern version of the age-old David and Goliath story.
4 ||| The film serves as a valuable explanation of the ways in which the cultivation and exportation of a particular crop can affect the welfare of fragile countries.
4 ||| A mesmerizing documentary illuminating the human element in one corner of modern global trade.
2 ||| A dry but enlightening documentary.
2 ||| Meskela's is a story worth tackling again -- but without the over-caffeinated approach.
2 ||| It almost makes you want to be forced to spend six bucks for a latte.
3 ||| Guaranteed to make you think twice about what you're paying for what you're drinking.
3 ||| "Black Gold" also finds cause for optimism in its connections, showing how if Western coffee drinkers make the right choices at their end, they can positively affect the African growers at the other.
3 ||| This is a documentary that gets a lot across while avoiding cliches and easy exploitation, even in famine-ravaged places where more horrific images must have abounded.
2 ||| A hard-hitting documentary in support of Fair Trade focusing on the tireless efforts of a manager of a coffee grower's cooperative in Ethiopia to get members more money for their labors.
3 ||| The lesson is clear: The system is broken and needs repair, and educating consumers is part of the solution.
3 ||| Economic repression by competitive market forces is a systemic injustice in this corner of the marketplace.
4 ||| The premise powerfully postulated here is that not only Ethiopians, but millions and millions of other Africans are suffering due to the paltry prices paid by big business for natural resources which most people from developed countries take for granted.
2 ||| Warm relaxing pace becomes languishing, most of the beans have been spilt by the halfway mark. Still, it's definitely educational, an effective call to action.
4 ||| Black Gold raises issues in an engaging way without preaching or becoming a lesson in economics. At the end of it all you will certainly be looking for those Fair Trade stickers.
3 ||| The film's effectiveness is bolstered by juxtaposed scenes of fat and happy Americans and Europeans slurping up frozen chai lattes and clucking about how big Starbuck's is getting with scenes of children going into 'therapeutic feeding centers'.
4 ||| Black Gold moves at an inexorable pace, painstakingly building a case until suddenly it looms very large and casts an even longer shadow.
2 ||| Whether due to resources or time or just plain laziness, directors Marc and Nick Francis have fashioned a rather shapeless movie that raises many good points but fails to fully investigate its findings.
4 ||| An important and timely film that may make you think twice before downing your next cup of joe.
2 ||| While the film is quick to posit fair trade as a solution, it fails to answer why, even with Meskela's admirable initiatives, his coffee farmers still struggle to buy shoes.
2 ||| If you don't buy Fair Trade coffee after this you never will.
2 ||| A worthy look at an exploitation that really shouldn't exist in this day and age, Black Gold will hopefully shock audiences into looking for the Fairtrade symbol next time they're in the supermarket.
2 ||| True, fair trade coffee is not the newest story around, but Black Gold still makes for arresting viewing.
3 ||| Contrast that with shots of the grower's malnourished children relying on emergency foreign aid and it's enough to make your blood boil - never mind the coffee.
2 ||| Intimate interviews with starving farmers selling beans for 24p a kilo while we pay 2 a cup will make you appreciate the importance of fair-trade when ordering your next double-shot, skinny latte.
2 ||| While it may prompt some to think again next time they're in Starbucks, this astute insight into the coffee business is better at lauding the good guys than taking the multinationals to task for the iniquities of the global economy.
3 ||| It is attractively shot, thoughtfully edited, provocatively argued, and might just have you turning its issues over in your mind late into the night - or is that just the effect of so much coffee?
4 ||| Rossen's film chronicles this life of raw power with compelling scenes, and Crawford's performance is well-supported by the rest of the cast.
4 ||| Goodness me, this movie could not have been more prophetic had Nostradamus himself written it.
2 ||| The acting is way over-the-top, however, Broderick Crawford is great!
4 ||| Splendid portrait of political corruption. More timely than ever.
3 ||| Broderick Crawford is no Orson Welles, but this meditation on the underbelly of American politics is at least in the same league as Citizen Kane.
3 ||| Outstanding poltical commentary, rife with tension.
4 ||| It features one of the great performances in movie history.
4 ||| A classic tale of power corrupting absolutely
4 ||| Not only has this movie stood the test of time, but its content is as uncomfortable and relevant today as it was the day the film premiered.
4 ||| Stark is a work of art; a walking id whose momentum surges like the adrenaline that busts through his veins as he delivers his fist-pumping speeches.
3 ||| Broderick Crawford gives an outstanding performance as the corrupt politician Willie Stark.
3 ||| A savage indictment of the system.
3 ||| Smart, fascinating and horrifying, All the King's Men is an example of late 1940s filmmaking at its best.
3 ||| Details the rise and fall of a Southern politician
3 ||| A blistering and still powerful political drama that deservedly won the best picture Oscar, with the best actor award going to gruff Broderick Crawford in the performance of a lifetime as Willie Stark.
3 ||| A one-note actor, Crawford landed the role of a lifetime and makes the most of it, even if there isn't much variation in his eventual change from the earnest Stark to the evil Stark. Far better are John Ireland and especially Mercedes McCambridge.
3 ||| The protagonists devolve into antagonists, until there's no one left to be the hero.
3 ||| Street Fight sputters with anger and despair at the durability of dumb-cluck demagoguery in American politics.
4 ||| A tough and brave little documentary about the brutal 2002 Newark mayoral election.
4 ||| It's a fascinating film, simultaneously enthralling, infuriating and guaranteed to make viewers ask how such a perversion of the political process could be taking place in America.
3 ||| James is his own worst enemy in the documentary, behaving in public as a near caricature of Boss Tweed. But he won and is now serving out his fifth term.
3 ||| The story that first-time feature filmmaker Curry tells is extremely compelling, but where he really scores is in addressing politics and race in a way that allows events to speak for themselves.
3 ||| It's kind of reassuring to see good old-fashioned dirty politics practiced with as much gusto as they are in the Oscar-nominated documentary Street Fight.
4 ||| [Marshall] Curry's picture is must-see fare for any and every observer of the curious world of American politics.
3 ||| The documentary is simple and strong and small. Its grit lifts it above its mechanical shortcomings.
4 ||| There's no question which side Curry favors, but he turns Street Fight into an old fashioned political yarn, featuring hand-pumping and baby-kissing, but also a dash of blood fury.
3 ||| an amazing work, thrilling and informative in equal amounts, reminding us that democracy isn't just fought over on message boards and foreign battlegrounds, but also on our very streets
3 ||| It's utterly fascinating, and if you don't follow New Jersey politics, you will be kept in the dark about the outcome of this 2002 race almost to the end.
3 ||| Booker and James square-off for a heavyweight political fight reminiscent of Holyfield vs. Tyson, except for the eating of ears.
4 ||| Street Fight isn't going to restore your faith in our desperately broken electoral system, but Cory Booker -- and the last moments of the movie -- may help you harbor that little flame of hope.
1 ||| Just dull and forgettable, not the so-bad-it's-good camp classic some people insist.
1 ||| The material is so slight it can hardly bear the weight of music, and it sinks altogether during a series of the most incompetent and clumsy dance numbers I've ever seen.
2 ||| The conjunction of truth and lies hardly seems accidental in a film that sets out to recall a kind of filmmaking now lost, but succeeds only in denting pleasant memories.
3 ||| Funny and real.
2 ||| While there's no denying that filmmaker Michael Kang possesses a fair amount of talent, this certainly isn't an appropriate vehicle with which to judge his abilities.
3 ||| The backdrop of this seedy motel is just the perfect place to illustrate the awkward times of early teen life.
3 ||| Like Jared Hess before him, director Michael Kang is the new kid on the block who wants to play inside Wes Anderson's clubhouse.
3 ||| Michael Kang's small, perfectly observed portrait of a Chinese-American boy captures the glum desperation of inhabiting the biological limbo of early adolescence.
4 ||| Kang's film avoids broad generalizations about the Asian-American experience to focus on the horrors of adolescence, when differences in race and ethnicity can only add to the general torment.
3 ||| Michael Kang Kang makes an impressive feature directorial debut with The Motel. But the person to keep an eye on is Jeffrey Chyau, a student at the Bronx High School of Science, who is a delight in the lead role.
3 ||| Unlike so many indie films, Michael Kang's gently empathetic debut embraces eccentricity without drowning in its own hip irony.
2 ||| It's actually really touching in parts, as well as infuriating.
2 ||| The third effort of Korean-American writer-director Michael Kang of New York brings attention to his unique demographic, but should have been a better made movie.
2 ||| A well-worn coming-of-age tale enlivened by pungent detail and a sharp visual sense.
3 ||| It's Kang's understanding of human nature -- not particularly profound, but true and sharp as a perfectly drawn arrow -- that makes this unpretentious production sing.
3 ||| ...specific and detailed enough to separate itself from the pack.
2 ||| It's a modest triumph of unflattering realism, proving yet again that a camera, a few good actors, the right material and a sensitive director are all you need to illuminate any particular aspect of humanity.
2 ||| It's pretty much a customary coming-of-age tale, though it is told with refreshing honesty and realism.
3 ||| As rundown as it is and as downbeat as its denizens are, only 76 minutes seems like too short a stay at "The Motel."
2 ||| Each of Ernest's interactions and epiphanies is pure, calculated movieland.
3 ||| Perhaps The Motel meanders a bit too much -- hard to do in a 76-minute film -- but it is an engaging little movie.
3 ||| The Motel gives the lie to all those mainstream teen sex comedies starring happy, horny gwailos .
4 ||| A most impressive feature film debut by writer/director Michael Kang who has crafted a compelling tale by examining rites of passage from a fresh perspective, namely, that of a Chinese-American adolescent.
3 ||| A welcome addition to the "awkward adolescence" genre,
3 ||| Such a heady combination of greed, girls and goals, all set to a pulsating funk background, should provide even a hardened football refusenik with 90 minutes (+ stoppage time) of entertainment.
3 ||| A lively 1970s tone that neatly captures soccer's brief North American heyday.
3 ||| An engrossing account of American soccer's strangest episode -- and you don't even have to like footie to enjoy it.
3 ||| A good yarn well spun, a story so fascinating that you'll be hooked until the very end.
2 ||| The film is an uncanny reflection of soccer itself: intermittently engaging but generally a dramatically inert bore.
4 ||| The perfect mix of style and substance, visuals, music and words ... one of the best sports documentaries ever made.
3 ||| An enlightening look back at how "the world's sport" briefly took off in the US.
2 ||| Told in a breezy, fast-cut style, and backed by a boisterous soundtrack that ranges from Puccini to James Brown, Lifetime focuses on the players -- on the field and off -- that made the Cosmos such a super, if short-lived, team.
3 ||| Giddy, gossipy and endearingly unslick, Once in a Lifetime chronicles the rise and fall of the most famous soccer team in the United States with slapdash glee.
3 ||| Crowder and Dower's film is a refreshing reminder that... without the Cosmos' brief and shining moment in the sun, suburban soccer leagues would be as rare as collegiate boccie tournaments.
3 ||| A colorful time capsule of 1970s New York... the doc's jauntiness is enhanced by its many charismatic characters and a funky, wall-to-wall soundtrack...
3 ||| The documentary offers enough color and depth to hold your interest and leave you keen to see the World Cup finals.
3 ||| No Hollywood scriptwriter would dare make up a tale as outrageously unlikely -- but, as it happens, true -- as the one so entertainingly told in the documentary Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos.
3 ||| Once in a Lifetime performs a belated autopsy on the Cosmos and the North American Soccer League and basically concludes that they died of impatience.
3 ||| Needless to say, until the unhappy ending, we've got an entertaining and edifying romp.
4 ||| Crowder and Dower wonderfully coax the participants to tell us everything and present it in a very entertaining, engaging and informative way that will have fans and non-fans laughing all the way
3 ||| You don't need to be a soccer fan to, like Cosmos fans, fall for this captivating tale, told in Rashomon-like style.
3 ||| Aptly portrays the country's brief love affair with soccer and acknowledges that it will continue to thrive, whether we're paying attention or not.
2 ||| Lively, free-wheeling amusement.
2 ||| A slick, gossipy documentary that pulses to the strains of James Brown, Parliament and the Love Unlimited Orchestra as it glosses over facts to make its questionable case for the Cosmos.
3 ||| This is not an exercise in fabricated nostalgia, but a raucous chronicle of defeat snatched from the jaws of victory.
1 ||| Another soccer film? Buy, hey, it's about a NEW YORK soccer team, glorifying the late Steve Ross, the number one corporate viper! For those who believe the world ends at the Hudson River only.
2 ||| An energetic and often enjoyable documentary, particularly for soccer fans.
3 ||| Once in a Lifetime does a wonderful job of showing that this collection of foreigners playing a foreign sport forged one of the great American sports stories.
2 ||| The movie is only so-so, borrowing a little from the VH-1 school of popumentary but lacking the snazzy production values.
2 ||| Essentially an extended cable special.
3 ||| How that dream was realized and what factors brought it and its league to a horrific crash scarcely a decade later is the intriguing drama that directors Paul Crowder and John Dower are able to reconstruct.
2 ||| The movie is ultimately too long and too this-no-name-player- was-traded-for-that- no-name-player detailed for casual viewers.
3 ||| Once in a Lifetime would have benefited greatly from historical and outside perspective, but the story on screen is such a kick that even monotone narrator Matt Dillon gets caught up in the excitement.
3 ||| It has some funny scenes and wild characters who reflect back on the glory years, where the clashes of ego were as legendary as Pelé's amazing bicycle-kick goals.
2 ||| New York went bust, so did the team, yet scattered seeds for smarter soccer growth later.
4 ||| It's a rags-to-riches story that shows how American money and imagination revolutionized not just a team, but the entire sport of soccer, back then and still to this day.
2 ||| ... treats its audience like a bunch of attention deficit disorder cases.
2 ||| Packed with observations and recrimations, many of the latter aimed at or by Chinaglia, which makes for some gossipy entertainment.
3 ||| An energetically told tale, with eccentric characters to spare and a nostalgically bittersweet tone.
3 ||| With just a little tweaking ... could be reworked in a Christopher Guest-style mockumentary of swollen egos and corporate whimsy.
3 ||| mostly I'm stricken with nostalgia for '70s fashion and Marv Albert's hairdo
3 ||| Well-researched and exuberantly compiled, this is a thoroughly entertaining tribute to America's first tackle at surgically implanting the beautiful game.
2 ||| Once in a Lifetime is like a soccer team that plays good defense but lacks offense.
2 ||| ...never quite as compelling as Hller's performance...
3 ||| Sandra Hueller deservedly won an acting prize in Berlin (she could have taken home 'most conflicted character' as well).
3 ||| The film is incisive about the all-too-mundane social, physical and emotional pressures exacted upon its heroine.
3 ||| Hller's master class in acting is not only a portrait of a holy creature frenzied by otherworldly spirits but a voluptuous reflection of the pressures that accosted so many women of her character's age, time, and devotions.
3 ||| Progresses in a natural, unforced style that's increasingly creepy and ultimately emotionally shattering.
3 ||| Like The Exorcism of Emily Rose ... Requiem is loosely based on the real-life story of a West German woman who died in 1976 after a series of failed exorcisms.
2 ||| Takes the flashback sequences from Exorcism of Emily Rose, removes all the supernatural scares, and tries to keep you interested.
4 ||| Just as haunting as a horror film and far more heartrending.
2 ||| A demonic posession movie WITHOUT special effects? Horrors!!!
4 ||| Bogumil Godfrejow's raw cinematography and (Sandra) Huller's poignant, close-to-the-bone performance transform what might have been a morbid curiosity into an entirely enthralling, quietly terrifying experience.
3 ||| You won't find rotating heads and vomit in the exorcism movie Requiem. Instead, German director Hans-Christian Schmid relies on a frighteningly realistic performance by Sandra Huller as blue-eyed blonde Michaela.
3 ||| In lesser hands, Requiem would seem merely bleak, but Schmid makes a rigorously urgent and compelling film out of Michaela's odyssey.
3 ||| Based on the same story as The Exorcism of Emily Rose, this is a far more accurate and ultimately much more frightening version of events, with an award-winning performance from Huller.
3 ||| What cannot be debated is the strength of Huller's naturalistic lead performance, a frighteninglyn intense turn that brings to mind Emily Watson's work in Breaking the Waves.
4 ||| The confusion and panic and everyday interactions in Requiem feel honest and true-to-life, which has nothing to do with how factual it is, or isn't.
3 ||| Stage actress Sandra Huller delivers a stunning, understated performance...
3 ||| A naturalistic and thrillingly powerful film, with a stand-out performance from Hller at its centre.
3 ||| Working from an economical and intelligent script by Bernd Lange , Schmid directs his first feature with the easy conviction that eluded the makers of the preposterous Emily Rose.
3 ||| [Huller] combines the raw physicality of Michaela's seizures with an emotional confusion as she ponders the cause of her attacks and how to react to them.
3 ||| A tragic tale of teen rebellion and misplaced faith, this is a sober and sobering account of a young girl's untimely end, made enthralling by great performances and restrained direction.
4 ||| A convincing portrayal of a helpless soul wavering between fear and faith, and the madness of murder being perpetrated in the name of Christ.
4 ||| an intense, disturbing and bleak drama of ecstasy and insanity, all set in a world where, if there is a God at all, it truly requires a leap of faith into the dark to grasp Him.
2 ||| In the end, Requiem is something of a disappointment.
2 ||| Depois de prender a ateno do pblico durante sua metade inicial graas a idias e momentos interessantes, o roteiro se perde sem maiores avisos, transformando-se em uma baguna capaz de levar at mesmo o mais paciente dos espectadores  loucura.
2 ||| isn't quite the terrorfest that it's billed as, but it will hold your interest. Just don't expect to scream.
3 ||| It's a hilarious, crowd-pleasing film about everything from honesty to sex to freedom that's definitely smart without being too overbearing.
2 ||| A flotilla of L.A. residents gathers in an unlandscaped recreation area in Baldwin Hills to canoodle, attempt suicide, plot revenge and dig into one another's psyches in writer-director Kurt Voelker's high-spirited if slight comedy, Park.
2 ||| If Park aspired to any real insights or to any ambition beyond the routine, its hysterics would be worth sitting through.
2 ||| There are plenty of laughs in the outrageous predicaments and the actors are obviously having a ball.
2 ||| There's very little cohesion among the separate storylines and aside from some nice performances, it all seems rather pointless.
2 ||| None of the characters seems particularly believable, except Lake's; she brings some feeling to a thin role. And the campy, "outrageous" comedy is pretty thin, too.
1 ||| Suicide, infidelity, spousal abuse and arrested development are the building blocks of Park a wearisome comedy.
0 ||| Man, have we gone downhill since Short Cuts.
1 ||| Annoying, pretentious and impossible to follow.
3 ||| Drifting through this world with Jack, you've just got to let go and enjoy the slow burn.
2 ||| Accessible and entertaining, with enough local flavor to seem exotic to English viewers. Not only that, but it's FUN.
3 ||| Worth seeing for the delightful banter between Feore and Bouchard.
2 ||| It's all a bit hackneyed and cliched.
3 ||| As with all buddy movies, Bon Cop Bad Cop succeeds on the strength of the leads' rapport.
3 ||| Its good-hearted probing of Canada's social and cultural balancing act likely will do more to promote harmony in Canada than a whole raft of political speeches.
2 ||| Bon Cop Bad Cop is what it is, and no more: un bon summer entertainment.
2 ||| Largely fun... But there is one caveat: it is almost certainly impossible to completely love this film if you're not a bilingual Canadian.
2 ||| A terrific subject becomes a tepid morality play.
2 ||| Fernando Meirelles and Edward Zwick take note: Amazing Grace is proof that liberal filmmakers can make movies that aren't desperate manifestations of their political guilt.
4 ||| This compelling bio-pic is an overdue tribute to William Wilberforce (1759-1833), the British abolitionist who, for 20 years, tirelessly lobbied Parliament to end England's participation in the slave trade.
2 ||| TV in vision, structure and execution. To think feature film as a delivery vehicle for it is more ambitious than this telling of a worthy, under-appreciated story justifies.
4 ||| An inspiring drama directed by Michael Apted about a zealous abolitionist in eighteenth century England who models for us a moral heroism.
4 ||| an intelligent film about serious thinkers and their ideas, and it's director Michael Apted's spare, incisive vison that prevents the film from becoming either cloying or maudlin, though the screen is painted with emotion
2 ||| Apted is without a doubt one of the foremost documentarians working today. His Up Series represents a cinematic hallmark. His feature credits are less certain.
3 ||| A creditable historical drama about those who choose to be in the world, not merely of it.
3 ||| A movie for people who like uncomplicated, uplifting stories where good triumphs over evil.
2 ||| Like Steven Spielberg's glossy Amistad before it, Amazing Grace shies away from the texture and complexity of color, scurrying instead for the safer platitudes of black and white -- good and evil.
3 ||| Director Michael Apted and his team understand the challenges of this kind of story and have met them with intelligence and energy. [He] has managed to be true to the outsized emotions of the story without giving way to sentimentality.
3 ||| Amazing Grace arrives Hollywood-slick, a polished British period piece. It manipulates, but then again, so does the song that gives it its title. Movies, like hymns and history, should give us a good cry.
2 ||| It's clear that the filmmakers believe a movie about political debate has to have a lot of speechifying. Consequently, it's so talky that it gradually loses our interest, which is a real shame.
2 ||| Earnest, respectful and thoroughly dull, Michael Apted's Amazing Grace follows all of the worst traditions of British historical dramas.
2 ||| What makes William Wilberforce a great man is also what makes him a bore: He's possessed of such intractable single-mindedness and confidence in the rightness of his ideals that we can't help but wish he would lay aside saving the world for a while.
2 ||| It's a good story, but director Michael Apted can't help but fall into the usual cinematic habits of the hagiographic species.
2 ||| How could Michael Apted, who directed those towering pillars of truth the 7 Up documentaries, make a movie as bogus as Amazing Grace?
2 ||| Well-made by Michael Apted, and well-acted all around.
3 ||| That rare bird: a tear-jerker about the House of Commons and the antislavery movement in England. Michael Apted's idolatrous portrait of abolitionist William Wilberforce is wall-to-wall with intriguing characters and deeply felt performances.
2 ||| The rhythms [director Michael Apted and editor Rick Shaine] establish are jumpy and unsteady, afraid of allowing a scene to breathe and flow naturally. If the script were more alive, these matters of visual technique would matter less. But not much less.
2 ||| Gruffudd and the amazing cast give performances that would make this film more useful in teaching drama school than in teaching social studies.
4 ||| How do you make the slavery debates of 18th-century British parliament feel cinematic? By casting some of the best brogues around.
3 ||| Coming soon to a social studies class near you.
2 ||| Amazing Grace, a prettified take on the life and times of the 18th-century reformer William Wilberforce, carries a strong whiff of piety. It isn't a bad smell; there are notes of roses and treacle in the mix, but also elements of sweat and pain.
3 ||| Gruffudd and Apted are pleasantly earnest in their efforts to spread Wilberforce's message of peace and justice.
3 ||| [The screenwriter] does an admirable job of streamlining a story that unfolds over the course of 20 years. Meanwhile, Apted allows his fine cast the breathing room to make historical figures feel like living, breathing people rather than waxworks.
4 ||| A detailed, affecting biography of one of the great souls who moved humanity forward.
4 ||| Often vulnerable, more often inspiring, Gruffudd's Wilberforce not only stirs curiosity but also quickens your conscience. As Fox notes eloquently, he was a great man. One does not have to be religious to believe he had amazing grace.
4 ||| Don't shy away for fear of a dry bit of educational cinema; Amazing Grace is a well-told and very human story.
2 ||| Characters are so imprisoned by the movie's need to drive home its antislavery message that they become utterly lifeless. Pretty pictures abound in Amazing Grace, but they don't serve to illustrate any ideas or emotions worth wrestling with.
3 ||| Amazing Grace isn't quite an accurate title for this entertaining history lesson, but no one will ever write a song titled 'Amazing 20-Year Period of Parliamentary Maneuvering to End Britain's Role in the Slave Trade.'
3 ||| Michael Apted's compelling and highly informative Amazing Grace is an apt celebration of America's Black History Month, even though its story takes place in England.
3 ||| The film ultimately tells a powerful and little-known historical tale.
2 ||| Director Michael Apted and screenwriter Steven Knight can't help letting a little sanctification take hold -- while also, sadly, making a charged historical subject seem tedious.
2 ||| Director Michael Apted tells the story with dry devotion to parliamentary procedurals and a worshipful approach to Wilberforce. But [actor] Gruffudd lacks the intensity and charisma to pull it off.
3 ||| Director Michael Apted has turned out a movie that might be best described as faithful, both in its attention to accuracy and in its acknowledgement of the role faith played in righting one of the great social wrongs.
2 ||| I'm sure [director] Apted meant well, but Amazing Grace comes across as a surprisingly graceless biopic narrowed down to one white man's uncomfortable burden.
3 ||| The film is inspiring. When Wilberforce finally achieves victory, Lord Fox makes a speech, in which the opening words, sadly, still ring true today: 'When people think of great men, rarely do they think of peaceful men.'
4 ||| The movie is the usual kind of film biography of a respected figure from the distant past -- honorable, oversimplified, handsome.
2 ||| It's a doughty movie, stuck halfway between Masterpiece Theatre and Classics Illustrated.
2 ||| An inspirational, moving and wonderfully well-told story that comes to the screen at just the right time.
2 ||| Amazing Grace may not accomplish the depth of poignancy inherent in its subject, but it's a steady effort.
3 ||| Although the film does skirt the edge of preachiness at times, you certainly can't argue with the basic human decency that it's preaching.
3 ||| The rhetoric in the film is clearly intended to be relevant to the situation in the United States today... 'Our fear of an unknown enemy must not be allowed to erode our long-cherished liberties,' says a Wilberforce ally.
4 ||| A well-told cinematic example of a man who used his faith and God-given opportunities to change the world for good.
3 ||| There is a cheering sense of moral force behind this film, which could have become preachy, trite and clotted with self-righteousness.
3 ||| A good film editor could have made this 111-minute effort into an entertaining, tight 90 minute film, without losing any of the story or suspense.
2 ||| Blending period drama with message-driven political wrangling, Amazing Grace is as earnest and well-intentioned as it is unsurprising.
2 ||| Chimes in for freedom, but rarely hits the high notes.
2 ||| ...ponderous and relentlessly padded in its moral morass... Grace manages to work effectively as a crusading costume drama drenched in consciousness and conviction.
2 ||| Climax is a groundswell of tear-inducing virtue that ultimately leaves Grace on a high, if not amazing, note.
2 ||| Think of this as "Pride and Prejudice" meets "Reds".
3 ||| One of the nobler 'based on true events' efforts I've seen in some time, one of the most entertaining and a fine example of the work of a master-craftsman filmmaker.
2 ||| AMAZING GRACE is a second-class film on a first-class theme. The film smolders for almost two hours without ever catching emotional fire. Some enormous liberties were taken with history.
3 ||| Perhaps more Masterpiece Theatre than motion picture, Amazing Grace nevertheless tells a story that's compelling enough to compensate for the occasional stuffiness.
4 ||| Don't miss this film.
3 ||| Amazing Grace marks an unforgettable and regrettable time in world history while highlighting a few who valiantly set out to right the wrongs.
4 ||| All the elements work harmoniously together: beautiful settings, an extremely talented cast who bring the characters to life, gorgeous costuming and a rich script that informs and delights.
4 ||| "Amazing" indeed.
2 ||| There's so much story here that the characters don't have quite enough room to breathe, but it's still a fascinating look at a time, and a man, worth remembering.
2 ||| It is to be hoped that Amazing Grace is not the only, or the last, cinematic celebration of 200th anniversary of abolition, for there are more stories to tell, more imaginatively.
2 ||| The movie emerges in the end as a stirring and -- cover your ears, kids -- educational ode to the political power an individual with a cause can inflict on the morally bankrupt status quo.
2 ||| So much to admire and so little to amaze.
2 ||| Accessibility is one of the movie's virtues: without dumbing down, it makes the workings of Parliament seem as gripping as a good suspense thriller.
2 ||| Gruffudd's Wilberforce lacks charisma and the House of Commons scenes are interminable. Worthy shouldn't mean dull. What a waste.
3 ||| Amazing Grace thoughtfully explores the issue of slavery without sermonizing or losing sight of the fact that modern audiences still need to connect with relatable characters no matter how important the subject matter.
3 ||| Impressively directed, politically relevant and occasionally inspirational, this is an enjoyable, engaging drama with strong performances from its talented cast.
1 ||| It's neither amazing nor graceful.
2 ||| A fascinating story, a great cast, but average in its presentation.
3 ||| Skilfully written and directed, the film is an involving drama, even if it's overly worthy and sentimental.
2 ||| A decent cast under Michael Apted's direction does its best, but it's dull, naive and dramatically inert.
2 ||| A good -- and important -- story, not always well told.
3 ||| Who'd have thought that the most compelling and thoughtful film to be presented during Black History Month would be a formal British import set in 18th century England with men running around in wigs?
2 ||| There's a lot of good intentions behind Amazing Grace, but the movie's a bore, swirling into the minutia of antiquated British law.
2 ||| I'm not sure what was a bigger problem for me, though--that the story jumped around so much, or that the tone did, too.
2 ||| Amazing Grace proves to be an invaluable history lesson, but a rather boring film.
2 ||| Earnest drama about fervent English abolitionist.
2 ||| Alas, the subject matter is far more interesting than the execution... It's a film bogged down with staid dialogue that reeks of horse manure.
3 ||| Stylish, sexy and deeply emotionally resonant.
2 ||| ...an egregiously slow-paced piece of work that works neither as a character study nor as a police procedural...
4 ||| Informative documentary filmmaking that belongs as much on library shelves and agency case files as in your local theatre.
3 ||| Cocaine Cowboys' in-the-moment kicks are, after the lights come up, apt to leave one with something of an ashamed and remorseful hangover.
1 ||| What was needed was the Frontline approach; what is provided, sadly, is Brian de Palma Lite.
3 ||| A slick look at the cocaine trade of the 70s/80s that made Miami the home of more homicides per capita, and more banks per square mile, than any other city in America.
4 ||| An exhilarating documentary that details the chaos, glamour and greed of the drug industry in Miami during the 1970s and '80s.
3 ||| Cocaine cash financed Miami's renaissance, but the film never downplays the human cost at which that urban renewal was purchased.
3 ||| While it's a bit haphazardly organized and offers only a cursory analysis of the drug war's impact on the city, Billy Corben's second documentary is ultimately as compelling as any pulp yarn.
1 ||| Parts of Cocaine Cowboys manage the impossible -- making cocaine boring. But the film doesn't shy away from presenting horrific images: We see blood-streaked walls, bullet-perforated bodies and Katie Couric's haircut circa 1981.
4 ||| If The Godfather movies were based on real gangsters and some of them were still around to talk about the good old days, they might be as fascinating as the characters in Billy Corben's documentary about the cocaine import business in 1970s Miami.
3 ||| An exercise in blood-soaked nostalgia, a look back at an era (the late 1970s and early 1980s) when Miami was a bad and dangerous place to live.
2 ||| Fans of Scarface and even Goodfellas will definitely get their thrills.
2 ||| A hyperventilating account of the blood-drenched Miami drug culture in the 1970s and 80s.
2 ||| The only thing more boring than listening to someone on drugs may be listening to someone brag about how many drugs he used to sell.
4 ||| Cocaine Cowboys is gleefully manipulative -- which is meant as a compliment. Edited for maximum impact, it packs the furious momentum and dramatic punch of a riveting feature film.
2 ||| While the filmmakers clearly got a contact high from hearing all these war stories, most civilians will find a little of this goes a long way.
3 ||| Through its use of archival news footage and contemporary interviews, Cocaine Cowboys proves to be an intoxicating exploration of Miami, the '80s cocaine trade and those who saw it all happen.
3 ||| It's a remarkable immersion in a world turned morally inside out.
2 ||| Aiming for encyclopedic coverage of the drug epidemic and its effect on the city, Corben packs much too much into one movie.
2 ||| After beginning at a healthy clip, the film becomes mired in endless remembrances of debaucheries past and Miami's descent into lawlessness.
2 ||| This is an ugly film, but with an undeniable allure.
2 ||| It's watchable, but like gorging on every rotten issue of the old Confidential magazine.
4 ||| Forget Scarface and Miami Vice. Cocaine Cowboys is the real deal -- a down-and-dirty look at the high living and illegal drugs that dominated south Florida in the 1980s.
2 ||| This documentary on Miami's lethal '80s cocaine scene is cut fast.
2 ||| The Jan Hammer music on the soundtrack works overtime to assure us that Cocaine Cowboys is the real, nastier version of Miami Vice
2 ||| Cocaine Cowboys is a fascinating look at a time when Miami was so flush with cash from cocaine deals that it was completely buffered from a nationwide recession.
3 ||| There's so much compelling material here, all of it salacious and dangerous and so enjoyable that you might just feel a little guilty afterward.
2 ||| Fast-paced and fascinating, but a little too frenetic for its own good.
1 ||| It's the sort of glamour-meets-violence drugs-crime story on which lads' mags thrive: unqualified, over-reverent and hysterical.
2 ||| Grisly crime scene snaps accompany the story, which makes Miami Vice look like a tea party and Florida like hell on earth.
2 ||| The haystacks of cash and coke are laughably insane - as is the head-count: thousands of people were gunned to death. This is the only state in the world where Scarface might raise a smile.
3 ||| At nearly two hours, Cocaine Cowboys (appropriately) doesn't know when to stop talking, but as a chronicle of a demented epoch, it's both entertaining and just about definitive.
2 ||| Without narration, the doc has scant moral compass, its very title celebrating the machine gun-wielding mercenaries involved.
2 ||| Too often the film crosses the line between recording his subjects' illegal activities and aggrandising them.
2 ||| A documentary examining the Miami drug wars of the early 1980s in exhaustive - and occasionally nauseating - detail.
2 ||| In the end, the script lets the film down with its obvious twists, its naggingly illogical narrative and a general pointlessness.
2 ||| A final reel of arterial spray splatter empties itself in record time and when Gone finally gets going, it's gone too soon.
2 ||| You will be kept waiting for the twist that never comes in Ringan Ledwidge's derivative psycho-thriller, whose by-the-numbers plotting is as inevitable as roadkill.
2 ||| If only it had taken the characters' lead and strayed further from the beaten track...
2 ||| A potentially menacing first half is let down by a few cliches in the home stretch.
2 ||| ...suffers from an egregiously laid-back pace that ultimately negates its few positive attributes...
2 ||| Having served my duty by pointing out the main failures of the film, it's equally obligatory to say that by film's end you have a better understanding of the opposing interests that are deconstructing Iraq than media coverage conveys.
2 ||| Tackles its topical subject with lurching focus and plenty of from-the-mouths-of-mouthpieces didacticism.
3 ||| Audiences expecting this film to wring any kind of order from the ongoing chaos may find that The Situation merely reflects this 'situation's' rat's-nest confusion and seeming hopelessness.
3 ||| While not easy to watch, and at times even harder to follow, Haas' film is an important attempt to accurately capture the confusing reality of contemporary Iraq.
2 ||| The narrative has no direction. There is no central problem to be resolved, no goal to be reached.
2 ||| The gravitas that director Philip Haas and writer Wendell Steavenson would like to bring to bear in this smallish war thriller is simply not an achievable goal.
3 ||| A powerful story about a frustrated American journalist risking her life to develop sources among Iraqi citizens who themselves are risking their lives to talk to her.
1 ||| Set in wartime Iraq, The Situation is exploitation cinema of the most narcoleptic kind.
2 ||| The Situation never fails to be illustrative, like in straight reporting, but at the expense of catharsis.
2 ||| The message is quite clear: We should withdraw our troops and let the Iraqis kill each other off.
2 ||| The super-accurate reportage may be lost when combined with the war-flick plot. Fact and fiction have different audiences.
2 ||| It fails to strike an emotional chord, however, with a meandering narrative and heroes who spout rhetoric like pundits.
2 ||| The Situation is promoting itself as the first American dramatic feature film to deal with the occupation of Iraq. While that may be true, it turns out not to matter that much.
3 ||| A gripping briefing on the post-Saddam morass of Iraq. The tactical calculus used by sheiks, insurgents, CIA operatives, soldiers, and civilians is ugly, but it's not inscrutable.
3 ||| The Situation' is bound to stir up controversy because of the way Americans are portrayed, and anything that gets people talking and thinking is for the good. It brings the war home, where our soldiers should be.
2 ||| It's a credit to the material and the basic plot that even as you're groaning over a clunky speech explaining it all, you're completely focused on what the situation in Iraq actually is.
3 ||| Bringing the chaos down to very human terms redefines the paradigm for thinking about the occupation, and makes this a film that is more than a mere exercise in action/adventure
2 ||| The concept is strong and expertly fleshed out; it's just a pity that Hollywood tropes are allowed to invade.
3 ||| Beneath the melodrama is an insider's account of the seemingly inconsequential details often edited out of dispatches from the front.
2 ||| A pretty lousy movie in general, though it's the film's somewhat accusatory Iraq War subject matter that's getting it some attention -- deserved or not -- that makes the whole thing a little distasteful.
2 ||| I don't think this movie sheds any new light on 'the situation', but it could have, and it's a shame that it didn't.
2 ||| Snow Blind calls itself a documentary, but it never stops feeling like the in-house channel on a ski-lodge television.
2 ||| Though some of the action cinematography is stunning, and practicing snowboarders will love the sense of camaraderie established, it's not riveting entertainment for the rest of us.
2 ||| It's understandable that Scott wants to highlight snowboarding's diversity, but perhaps a winter-sports documentary shouldn't try to cover the waterfront.
3 ||| A film with some wonderfuly oddball comedy while also being a very heart-felt statement about expanding on the person you are and finding your true voice.
3 ||| A lovely tale about communication, family, forgiveness, and 'something resembling love,' told through the story of a Native American family in small-town Oklahoma.
3 ||| this is what DVD players are for
2 ||| John Boorman's self-indulgent "moral fable" has promise ..., but like the dueling entrepreneurs who populate one strand of the narrative, delivers more sizzle than steak.
2 ||| Any potential in Boorman's sinister parable is frittered away with awkward dialogue, shallow characters and failed attempts at comedy. A curiosity at best.
2 ||| Despite Boorman's subtle, suggestive direction and a nice central performance from Gleeson, this low-key thriller never quite works.
2 ||| John Boorman's tale of doppelgngers in Dublin would like very much to spook us, but keeps tripping over its loose script and bizarre plot lines.
2 ||| Not quite a car crash of a movie, Boorman's uneven black comedy is more like a fender-bender. It falls into the twilight zone between so bad it's good and so bad it's bad.
2 ||| As tigers go, it's all growl and no teeth.
2 ||| You get two Brendan Gleesons for the price of one in John Boorman's Dublin-set comedy, though neither is shown to his advantage in this uncomfortable mix of social satire and over-ripe melodrama.
2 ||| Far from being a roaring, sinewy beast with a lot of bite that the title might suggest, John Boorman's latest has more in common with a lumbering white elephant.
2 ||| If there's anything about the movie that really rises above the mediocre, it's Gleeson's fantastic performance.
2 ||| The Tiger's Tail, like Cassandra's Dream, prominently features a boat that is both symbol of financial attainment and emotional ruin; it also finds a master filmmaker defying the "show, don't tell" principle with almost crippling cynicism.
2 ||| A real waste of a potentially interesting premise.
3 ||| The world recession has made this suspenseful film bitingly relevant beyond the local problems of the maiming of "The Celtic Tiger."
1 ||| Amateurish technical contrivance isn't this awkward, retro failure's only deficiency.
2 ||| A messy but absorbing mystery.
2 ||| A worthy addition to the bodyswap genre, thanks to a decent script and superb performances from its likeable leads.
3 ||| There's actually some serious subtext if we bother to look for it.
2 ||| ...the film does possess enough heart and laughs to warrant a mild recommendation.
2 ||| All this movie needs is a choreographed dance number to complete the circle.
2 ||| Raunchy teen comedy looks at gender roles; lots of cursing.
3 ||| A visual masterpiece and an amazing achievement in cinematography and editing.
3 ||| The resolution ties up enough loose ends to be satisfying, yet makes you think long after you've left the theater.
1 ||| Annoying, pretentious twaddle of the highest order.
3 ||| An avante-garde, admittedly experimental, absurdist, through-the-looking-glass glimpse of behind-the-scenes movie-making, it's the Mad Hatter's Tea Party.
2 ||| The editing-on-speed renders Hopkin's "experiment" inacessible to the degree that the movie will be lucky if it makes two cents.
2 ||| Blaring its pretense to Lynch-ness, Slipstream crumbles under the weight of Hopkins's self-indulgence, yet there is some measure of sincerity to this senseless upchuck.
2 ||| Slipstream is bold, experimental, off-the-wall kicky and utterly exasperating.
2 ||| Say this much for Anthony Hopkins' project: If he's going to indulge himself as a writer-director-star, it's probably better that he goes completely off the wall.
3 ||| A fever dream as much about life and death as the experience of making a movie and watching one.
2 ||| If not exactly dull, Hopkins' stream-of-consciousness rant is nonetheless self-indulgent and crammed with bits of business that never add up to anything much.
2 ||| At 96 minutes, this vanity/insanity project runs a bit long; five minutes would have been plenty.
2 ||| Slipstream is an experiment in visual stream-of-consciousness, but stream-of-consciousness fares better as a literary form than a cinematic one.
1 ||| Anthony Hopkins wrote and directed Slipstream. It's a free-form, surreal meditation on stuff that, evidently, popped into Hopkins' head while he was writing.
1 ||| ...makes you long for a pretentious, arty student short. Because those are only about eight minutes long.
3 ||| Leave it to a 69-year-old actor to make the year's most experimental film.
2 ||| Slipstream is Anthony Hopkins's third film as a director and his first as a quasi-avant-garde filmmaker working well outside the mainstream.
1 ||| A miserable mess of a stream-of-consciousness movie.
1 ||| What would have perhaps made an excellent short subject becomes a cumbersome, confusing and deeply unsatisfying mess of a vanity project.
2 ||| A Hopkins personal vanity project
0 ||| Slipstream is utterly unwatchable. I hated every minute of it.
3 ||| Just when you're sure you know how Delirious is going to close, DiCillo comes up with a capper that's as satisfying as it is understated.
3 ||| No one is spared in this whip-smart comedy about the entertainment industry.
3 ||| The story's surprises range from clever to annoying, but [director] DiCillo manages to hold it all together with his consistently amusing cast members, who make you laugh at their characters' self-absorbed folly.
3 ||| One of those savvy, low-budget crowd-pleasers that arrive in local theaters only via film festivals like San Sebastian and Sundance.
2 ||| With Delirious, Tom DiCillo puts our national obsession with fame under the magnifying glass, and what he spies is a bunch of people in desperate need of attention, approval, and friendship.
3 ||| Off beat in the best sense of the term; surprisingly successful with a theme that could easily have gone down the gully hole of corn; "Delirious" delivers.
3 ||| In the end, I don't know that Delirious has all that much to say about the fame game, but you'll laugh nonetheless.
3 ||| The prickly camaraderie between Buscemi and Pitt puts Delirious back on track, abetted by a hilarious turn by Gina Gershon.
3 ||| Despite some plot holes, Delirious hits the bull's-eye with razor-sharp performances and dialogue.
2 ||| Tom DiCillo’s angry comedy Delirious subjects modern celebrity culture to a microscopic examination that shows the toxic virus of fame squirming under its lens.
3 ||| It's an achingly funny film that is also a little sad around the edges.
2 ||| The film's got some good, amusing moments and, perhaps, an insight or two into hanger-on psychology.
3 ||| Short, sharp snapshot about celebrity and life on the fringe has nothing new to say, but it says it with considerable charm and affection.
4 ||| Delirious is a funny, insightful, entertaining poke at celebrity culture that lands quite a few notches above the typical, New York-set ensemble indie.
3 ||| Buscemi makes this pathetic and potentially lethal shutterbug a figure of surprising humor and compassion.
3 ||| A lark, a fairy tale, a tantalizing mix between John Scheslinger's much darker Midnight Cowboy and John Water's ultra sweet Pecker.
3 ||| In spite of the off-tone moments and thematic distractions, Delirious is engaging, intelligent and enjoyable.
3 ||| A prickly look at the poisonous nature of celebrity and the unsavory subculture it breeds around the edges.
4 ||| Delirious, by writer-director Tom DiCillo, has a special quality because it does not make paparazzi a target but a subject.
2 ||| Someday, far in the future, a team of archeologists will dig up the black, wizened, still beating heart of New York City, and it will look exactly like Steve Buscemi.
3 ||| A great romp with both Steve Buscemi and Michael Pitt having the time of their lives. Especially fun to see Pitt do something completely different.
3 ||| DiCillo finds comedy in the tragic, depth in the shallowness, and surprises in the clich
3 ||| DiCillo's spot-on writing -- and the exceptional performances by Buscemi and Pitt -- creates a touching and vivid friendship that stabilizes the film.
3 ||| With Delirious, writer-director Tom DiCillo has crafted a wonderfully giddy meditation on the nature of fame, the people who sell it and those doing the buying, and their mutually parasitic dependence on each other.
3 ||| I just wish you'd get the chance to see it in a theater like I did, because if more people took the time to do so then maybe we might actually get more intelligently crafted relationship comedies like it.
3 ||| As always, Buscemi masters his portrayal of needy desperation, but he still makes Les admirable for his capacity to go with the flow.
2 ||| Mature paparazzi drama isn't quite in focus.
2 ||| For all its time-worn situations and observations, Delirious has a truth or two to impart about our lust for celebrities.
2 ||| A victim of its own vitriol.
3 ||| DiCillo hasn't lost his gift for artfully skewering both those basking in fame's spotlight and those lurking in the shadows, while still finding a measure of affection for all of them.
2 ||| Underwritten and overplayed, it is one that not even Buscemi fans will treasure.
3 ||| The film isn't as broadly funny as the previous DiCillo-Buscemi collaboration Living in Oblivion, but its outsiders peering in have an uncomfortable resonance.
3 ||| It's not as sharp as his indie gems from the mid-1990s, but the thing's packed with bright performances and unique characters, which is what DiCillo does best.
2 ||| To their credit, Miller and Buscemi engage the audience's interest in what is essentially an extended conversation.
4 ||| It is a smart film in its humor, its subject, and its execution. Van Gogh could not have done better himself, and that is perhaps the best possible homage to this fallen artist.
3 ||| Interview can be a harrowing experience, but it's a highly skilled, emotionally gripping one.
2 ||| Interview is chiefly a showcase for actors Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller, as well as a case study in how to cinematically cope with stagy material.
3 ||| Charms in large part due to the performances of the two stars.
3 ||| Driven by a really smart script and strong performances by one of the most unlikely film pairings in many years.
3 ||| You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen as this terrific psychological game of cat and mouse unfolds. The incredibly sexy Sienna Miller burns up the screen with raw, sensual star power. She's hot
4 ||| It's mesmerizing on multiple levels, and by the time it was over the fun I was having was so palpable I'm sure it was showing all over my body.
3 ||| hums with life
3 ||| Premise of the Dutch film's remake seems less believable here, but the acting is compelling and believable.
3 ||| Buscemi's Interview moves forward in static bursts that are contained by the avid, yet unobtrusive direction and the intensity of the two principals.
3 ||| Interview doesn't say anything new regarding our obsession with celebrity or, to paraphrase Janet Malcolm, the moral indefensibility of journalism. But the way [Buscemi and Miller] psychologically thrust and parry more than carries the film.
2 ||| Since this unconvincing, contrived imitation only runs less than 90 minutes, the last half, combined with Sienna Miller's stunning beauty, almost makes it worth seeing.
2 ||| Director Steve Buscemi is not to be faulted for his filmmaking or acting skills, but as co-writer he could have done better than the false-sounding dialogue.
2 ||| There's nothing more to it than meets the eye.
2 ||| Buscemi creates an intriguing, if contrived, drama about the battle of the sexes.
3 ||| Miller is so good -- dumb, smart, wounded, wounding, a lollipop of sweet poison that you'd buy every day until it killed you -- that you feel you not only understand her but all actresses.
3 ||| Buscemi can play a hangdog cynic better than anyone, and Miller seizes her opportunity to express every emotion an actress can be asked to express.
2 ||| Interview is literate, well-paced and played at perfect pitch by Sienna Miller and director Steve Buscemi. I didn't buy it for more than two minutes.
2 ||| Vaporous and chilled to freezing, Interview lacks a single honest moment, but it does have plenty of diverting ones.
4 ||| Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller exude a raw sensuality in this steamy, character-driven drama which unfolds like a cross between Sleuth and Swept Away. Who'd ever expect to hear 'Steve Buscemi' and 'raw sensuality' in the same sentence?
2 ||| Van Gogh has now received the most profound posthumous tribute that the American film industry could possibly bestow with this tepid and only fitfully interesting remake of his own 2003 feature of the same name.
3 ||| An entertaining two-person talkfest ... with nice ending twists are like frosting on a fluffy cake -- not really necessary, but tasty nonetheless.
3 ||| The results may not seem to be taking place on planet Earth among verifiable humans, but, taken in the spirit of gladiatorial battle, the film is often fascinating.
4 ||| Tension, humor and pathos are wrung out from smart scripting and surprisingly effective performances.
4 ||| Has the kind of insight you won't find in Us Weekly.
2 ||| The most impressive thing about Interview is how much shock it manages to muster over the walloping nonrevelation that, now more than ever, hype begets headlines. Next up: the rich are getting richer!
3 ||| Despite the fact that both protagonists are equally appalling, the screenplay seems to have a soft spot for the woman. However, this doesn't take away from the fun of watching the two characters tear each other to pieces.
3 ||| Sharp dialogue and good performances keep it interesting. The film suggests a level of talent in Sienna Miller that she rarely gets a chance to show.
3 ||| Kind of fascinating, especially in the ways that Buscemi and Miller make their performances into commentaries on the types of characters they play. When actors are really turned loose to play actors, they can achieve merciless accuracy.
2 ||| Ultimately, pointless. One comes away from Interview exhausted.
2 ||| The end result of this showcase for Buscemi's writing, acting and directing chops is so uneven and mixed in small details and overall tone that it's anybody's guess if it's one for the Oscars or the Razzies next year.
2 ||| As the action moves from the restaurant and ultimately to Katja's spacious loft apartment, Interview becomes a house guest who has worn out his welcome.
3 ||| Interview is less like a realistic character study than a theatrical game of cat-and-mouse, and a well-played one at that.
3 ||| Interview slyly keeps you watching, wondering who will emerge from this long night's journey.
3 ||| An eminently watchable contest between two actors at the top of their games.
2 ||| I'll just say that Buscemi, who also directed and co-wrote, knows a lot about making movies but little about journalism.
2 ||| Interview has its moments but they can't prevent it from feeling a little long winded and unsatisfying. The premise makes it sound more interesting than the in-theater experience delivers.
3 ||| A thoughtful, challenging piece of work.
4 ||| Stick with it for Miller's gutsy tour de force and the kick of watching Buscemi, as actor and filmmaker, turn an experiment into a mesmerizing battle of wills.
2 ||| Miller delivers her strongest yet performance in this offbeat black comedy, which [is] intriguing, but a little draggy.
2 ||| Interview feels more like a lab experiment/tribute than a committed, personal drama, leaving us with the sense that Buscemi wanted to feel more connected to this material than he actually did.
2 ||| A mixed bag of realism and arch, dramatic exaggeration.
2 ||| After some impressive banter that hints at interesting character insights, the film loses steam at the halfway mark.
3 ||| Interview is smart, provocative and disturbing, a searing indictment of media, hypocrisy and the themes Theo Van Gogh explored in his original.
2 ||| Buscemi and Miller should be roundly praised for the acting chops they display in this thriller.
2 ||| Interview, a mood swing of a film with a trap-door resolution, is never much more than an elliptical exercise in symbiotic insincerity.
4 ||| A battle of who couldn't care less in which two parties' disinterest collides into a spark-filled festival of mutual loathing, attempted manipulation and resentment.
3 ||| Remaking a 2003 original by the slain Dutch director Theo van Gogh, Buscemi has produced a charmingly perplexing portrait that's anything but a knockoff.
2 ||| There is something perversely appealing about this film. Maybe it's the way Interview astutely comments on celebrities and our perceptions of them, as well as questioning the sincerity and truthfulness of the media.
2 ||| There's just one hysterical scene after another, ideal for an acting class but off-putting over the course of even a relatively short film like this one.
1 ||| Emotional honesty in the service of nonsense is still nonsense, no matter how many scabs it manages to pick at.
2 ||| A one-act play in search of a black box theater and an audience unfamiliar with such intense cat-and-mouse character studies as 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'
2 ||| There is precious damn little about watching a reporter and an actress trying to outsmart each other that could possibly be described as "compelling."
3 ||| With her performance in Interview, Sienna Miller does more for today's tabloid-fixture starlets than they'll ever do for themselves.
3 ||| Rainer Werner Fassbinder might have been able to make us care for these characters; Buscemi and Miller are only able to get us to concede their chops.
2 ||| Works better in concept than execution.
2 ||| Stagey but enjoyable drama with superb performances from its two leads.
3 ||| Media foes face off in intense indie adult drama.
3 ||| Pretty far from being a great movie, but it's not without its pleasures -- mostly due to the performers.
2 ||| Ultimately, this two-hander feels limited in scale, but frisky and diverting while it's on.
2 ||| Stagey filming aside, this is a sharp and controlled study of celebrity obsession.
2 ||| Interview is well-made but depends almost entirely on its acting. Neither of the two principals let it down, even when the screenplay isn't quite as sharp as it could have been.
2 ||| Sienna Miller as an airhead celeb more famous for her sex life than her movies? Quite a stretch for the British actress.
2 ||| It pretends to be about the games of deceit that go on between men and women, but it's really just a squib on the culture of celebrity, and the cynical conclusion that's meant to pull us up short is feeble and silly beyond patience.
1 ||| There can hardly be a bigger waste of time than this conceited and self-indulgent two-hander directed by Steve Buscemi, remade from a Theo Van Gogh film.
2 ||| Sienna does a good job of portraying Katya as a blonde, self-obsessed actress who is good at turning on the tears. Remarkable that.
2 ||| The constant see-sawing of emotion eventually becomes repetitive and wearisome.
2 ||| There's some nicely written dialogue in this remake of a foreign movie, but it's all extremely unsatisfying thanks to a so-what? ending and the script's inability to make us warm to its two principal characters.
3 ||| Snappy exchanges, smart acting and slick directing go to make up a wickedly entertaining work that's hugely enjoyable. A deft story about modern-day celebrity culture, it also proves what a talent Buscemi is as a director.
2 ||| Interview is a decently acted two-hander fringe play that doesn't deserve to be on film.
2 ||| Essentially it's a game of verbal ping-pong and, even if cynicism wins the day too easily in the end, the interplay is lively and intriguing.
2 ||| Interview is a decent showcase for the talents of its stars, but may leave you in doubt over the talents of its originator. Hopefully the other Van Gogh remakes in production will sport more smartness and subtlety.
3 ||| From its opening frame to its final revelation, Interview hums with life.
2 ||| Interview comes across more like an acting exercise than a workable story.
2 ||| Even the smart ending feels predictable once it's happened: "Move along," it seems to say, just like those New York cops. "There's nothing to see here."
2 ||| The movie really started off on a good note, but then it just got repetitive.
1 ||| The resulting film is a boring hour-and-a-half of watching two immature adults sink down to the Lord of the Flies lowest for no reason and hurl bile and vitriol at each other.
2 ||| A surprising plot. [Full review in Spanish]
0 ||| A large portion of the movie is given over to gymnastics competitions, which are not explained or photographed well enough to be very interesting.
1 ||| This is an odd and unbelievably bad movie.
1 ||| Hey, you got your gymnastics in my after-school special!
0 ||| The characters are laughable; the gymnastics are unattractive. There is nothing to recommend this film.
2 ||| Unfortunately, as far as acting exercises go, Gaylord couldn't score a 5.
2 ||| American Anthem employs some flashy and occasionally effective visuals, but its screenplay and characterization leave much to be desired.
3 ||| Hilarious stuff, though many of the segments go on too long, so that the gags tend to wear out their welcome.
3 ||| I discovered a solid handful of worthwhile chuckles in the flick, most of which came from the smoothly reliable Paul Rudd and the still-adorable Winona Ryder.
1 ||| 90 minutes of random, really bad sketch comedy.
2 ||| Let's talk about Paul Rudd. I think he may be in every film in 2007 and that's okay by me, because Paul Rudd has become an acting Man-God.
1 ||| One problem: The movie's just not funny.
2 ||| The Ten is, I guess, sacrilegious in the strictest sense of the term, and its interest in investigating the commandments can be skin deep, as they're often used as mere pretext for ribald nonsense.
2 ||| Despite many giddy moments, the conceit becomes gradually more exhausting, until somewhere around the seventh commandment you're ready to choose God's wrath over any more overproduced, A-list-acted throwaway TV sketches.
3 ||| a foul-mouthed, dirty-as-diapers, Republican-baiting retelling of the Ten Commandments
2 ||| Where Kieslowski's work always had a goal and a sense for how real people think, nothing about The Ten suggests that the filmmakers ever thought any further than the next meager, uncomfortable titter.
2 ||| You really have to be in the mood to get into The Ten's forced goofiness.
2 ||| For Bible-related fun, The Ten is at least a higher power than Evan Almighty.
1 ||| Everyone involved seems to have been operating from the presumption that gross and blasphemous equals hilarious. Would that it did.
1 ||| A lame and irritating comedy that is an endurance test to sit through.
3 ||| Not so much blasphemous as it is very silly, and it lives up to the one unbendable commandment of comedy: It's funny.
2 ||| A resoundingly mediocre film that commits the cardinal sin of tedium.
2 ||| It's more a frivolous spoof than a pointed satire.
2 ||| Multi-segment movies tend to be notoriously uneven, and this definitely proves to be the case with The Ten.
2 ||| The Ten is so proud of its own wit and irreverence that when you fail to be equally impressed, you are likely to wonder if your own sense of humor is, in some way, deficient. Rest assured it is not.
2 ||| Too often, The Ten is simply not funny enough, stretched thin by ideas played out too long.
1 ||| In other words, I hated it, and if there are a better three words in the English language to adequately explain my feelings I must admit I have not yet been able to find them.
2 ||| ...never fully takes advantage of its biblical premise.
2 ||| A Decalogue for special-ed students, The Ten leans too often toward the bizarre and the bewildering.
2 ||| This is one of those films where the humor is of the hit-and-miss variety, and it misses more often than it hits. The jokes are transparent. It's not difficult to divine what's supposed to be funny.
0 ||| It is as if the filmmakers created an 11th commandment of their own: Thou Shalt Not Laugh. And we don't.
2 ||| It's not an ice-water shock that The Ten turns out to be merely the fuse to a satirical firecracker that never quite explodes. What did we expect, Kryzsztof Kieslowski's The Dekalog as a comedy?
3 ||| The humor in The Ten is hit-or-miss, with some of the comedy and performances feeling kind of forced. Still, if you're in the mood for an unconventional Sunday school lesson, go see The Ten, "as a goof"!
2 ||| It never really quite works up the energy to be as wild and outrageous as it clearly wants to be.
2 ||| This is a take it or leave it proposition, but worth a place on your NetFlix queue.
2 ||| By flaunting its own stupidity, The Ten practically dares you not to laugh at it, like a stand-up comic who sells an unfunny joke through the ferocity of his delivery.
2 ||| Perhaps the Bible needs an 11th Commandment: Thou Shalt Not Bore. That might stem misfires such as The Ten.
2 ||| If there were Ten Commandments for filmmaking, one would certainly be: Thou shalt not pass off sketch comedy as a feature film, especially when charging $9 a ticket.
2 ||| ...The Ten wields its bad taste like a blunt instrument, bludgeoning you with buffoonery that's hard to resist.
2 ||| Not exactly the stone-etched last word on biblical moviemaking, The Ten at least has a rare flair for the non sequitur, and a sassy, spasmodic charm.
2 ||| There is a fun film in there somewhere, especially for those who know what they're getting into and are willing to just go with it. If you're not bothered by naked men frolicking and jokes about prison rape, then this is the film for you.
3 ||| Yeah we liked this movie (with our self-proclaimed warped senses of humor), but we KNOW it's not for everyone, so thou shalt not blame us if you don't enjoy it as much as we did.
2 ||| Thou shalt be funny. Thou, in this case, isn't.
2 ||| Wain is a big fan of offbeat, exaggerated humor that either hits so big you think he's a genius or misses so badly you wonder whether he's sane.
3 ||| As ridiculous as it is uproariously funny.
2 ||| Any of the film's concepts would be pretty funny in a tossed-off 'Saturday Night Live' skit, but presenting these absurdist ideas in the context of an impeccably produced albeit low-budget motion picture somehow sucks the comic air from the room.
1 ||| If you're looking for ha-ha funny, then The Ten is probably not for you -- you'll be more likely scratching your head in befuddled wonderment.
1 ||| Those worried about incurring God's wrath by seeing The Ten, don't concern yourselves -- by watching the film, you've suffered enough.
2 ||| we leave the theater feeling like we've just been at a church service that went on a little too long.
3 ||| One guesses the talent that signed up for this negligible movie did so out of good will for Wain and Marino. Or maybe they all did it ... as a goof.
2 ||| The Ten is, while not "bad," nor "unfunny," surely not as good as it had ought to be.
2 ||| Three of the comic segments in The Ten are sort of funny. Three others are just so-so. And the remaining four are just dumb, painfully unfunny and/or downright crude.
2 ||| Some bits... are shockingly funny. Others, like the surgeon who causes a woman's death "as a goof," are just shocking without the funny.
2 ||| Most of the segments are as clueless about their designated commandment as they are about what's supposed to be funny.
1 ||| A blasphemous parody so painful to sit through it seems designed by the Almighty as punishment for heathens and sinners.
2 ||| Rudd, whose wry deadpan proved indispensable in Judd Apatow comedies like 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up,' is used here mostly as a straight man, the host in charge of introducing stories that drift along without any real destination.
1 ||| The beyond-goofy collection of Commandment-inspired vignettes has funny moments, but it's a wildly uneven anthology, with three or four clunkers for every genuine chuckle.
3 ||| Minor Shyamalan, but still well worth seeing.
2 ||| The Happening quickly deteriorates into the worst movie of M. Night Shyamalan's career... and that's saying something.
1 ||| The actors try and fail to look terrified at things that simply aren't that terrifying to look at, unless you are one of those people who considers "Days of Heaven" to be a relentless excursion in gut-wrenching horror.
2 ||| But here's the real shocker, the statement that will blow all of your minds... this is one movie that you will be hoping for a twist ending!
2 ||| In many ways, this ecological horror epic is one of the single nastiest and downright terrifying pieces of popular entertainment I've seen in ages.
1 ||| one of the worst attempts at end-of-the-world ominousness since the Robot Holocaust battled the Ninja Apocalypse
2 ||| After the insufferably dense mermaid mythology of Lady in the Water, Shyamalan clearly wanted to keep things simple. He whizzed straight past simple to simplistic.
2 ||| The Happening is a divertingly goofy thriller with an animistic bent, moments of shivery and twitchy suspense and a solid lead performance from Mark Wahlberg.
1 ||| The movie is so inept in terms of coherent, cohesive storytelling and in some other filmmaking aspects that it deserves to be laughed off the screen.
2 ||| Basically a junior version of sci-fi disaster films ranging from The War of the Worlds (1953) to last year's The Mist
2 ||| Shyamalan is far better at setup than payoff, and the Sixth Sense director's latest once and for all cements that reputation.
1 ||| a cold pastiche, neither bloody enough to attract the crowd that hankers for that sort of thing, nor smart enough to attract the crowd that hankers for that
2 ||| Were the first 45 minutes of The Happening not as rattlingly effective as they are, one could chalk the film up as mediocre. There is such untapped potential, though, that the dishonest places Shyamalan chooses to take his audience are maddening.
2 ||| You know those meringue cookies that look so tempting on bakery shelves, the ones that evaporate moments after you pop them in your mouth and leave only the vaguest, unmemorable taste behind? That's The Happening.
3 ||| Portraying moments of drama and danger with a Hitchcockian lack of ceremony, Shyamalan's mundane depictions of tragedy create a quiet but weighty resonance.
2 ||| For all his complaints recently about being misunderstood, it seems it's Shyamalan who simply doesn't get us.
1 ||| This would all seem like a deliberate, self-parodying joke if it weren't coming from a filmmaker with no sense of humor whatsoever.
2 ||| As for The Happening, his throwback horror flick that plays like The Birds meets The Blob, it's beyond good and evil. It's dumbfounding.
2 ||| The Happening wants to scare us without providing a cause -- a trick only Hitchcock has managed.
2 ||| Instead of shocks, we get moments of tension, suspense and violence between stretches of running scared. Nothing wrong with that, except that the stretches are awfully long in places. And in the end, it all comes to not much.
2 ||| Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's eco-thriller starts with a clever premise and degenerates into spooky atmospherics, portentous pacing and stiff dialogue.
1 ||| mia ap' tis pio akompses, proheires kai hontrokommenes doyleies poy mporeis na petyheis se aithoysa
2 ||| It's a shame that the movie is such a tonal failure, because it does many other things right.
2 ||| If you're in the mood for an absurd film that alternates between boring and comedy, this is the movie for you.
2 ||| M. Night Shyamalan's worst film.
3 ||| Trying to understand the thought process of writer and director M. Night Shyamalan is akin to analyzing Jell-O. What keeps it wiggling and what binds it together? This particular circumstance also had an Alfred Hitchcock vibe.
2 ||| Shyamalan tries to give the events a scientific underpinning. But his logic is spotty, so what are meant to be eerie moments are not convincing.
2 ||| Both silly and preachy.
2 ||| Shyamalan seems to have lost his sense of the fine line between the disturbingly grotesque and the outright ridiculous. The film even seems to be a parody of the scientific method.
3 ||| Shyamalan movies demand that you surrender to his way of telling stories. If you're up for that, you should go.
2 ||| The screenplay is a mess, filled with unfunny moments of intended humor and funny moments of unintended humor.
2 ||| It's an entertaining movie, which is half the game, but it's not scary, which it should be. Neither is it something to be taken seriously, though it's intended to be.
2 ||| The story essentially stops moving midway through. All that's going to occur, in terms of building any true dramatic tension, already has happened by this point.
2 ||| We don't care. It doesn't matter if they live or die, if there's a happy ending, or some kind of twist. The Happening is a movie to walk out of, sleep through, or -- best of all -- not to bother with.
2 ||| The plot is absurdly preachy and illogical, and the dialogue uneven, with stinging lines followed by stinkers.
2 ||| If Shyamalan's ever going to do something different then he should have made something manic, dark and twisted. But that's not Happening.
2 ||| No one will watch any of Shyamalan's recent films twice. A movie that features Wahlberg suggesting everyone try to outrun the wind can barely be watched once.
2 ||| The final explanation, which comes as no surprise, is more preposterous than profound. If you want to see a scary movie about humans wreaking havoc on their planet, watch An Inconvenient Truth instead.
3 ||| A subtle, measured work, which means there will be many who find it dull and pointless.
3 ||| It's creepy, silly fun. And if it came from anyone else, it would be recognized as such. One thing is certain: The man hasn't lost his ability to entertain.
2 ||| Basically it's a half-hour Twilight Zone episode blown up to feature length.
2 ||| Nobody gets the time or the treatment to become a character you'd actually care about, which makes the general planet-in-peril theme of the movie kind of moot.
1 ||| No mere actor could possibly escape the toxic dialogue oozing from M. Night's pen -- that's merciless.
2 ||| If this was the movie to rescue the reputation of self-styled genius Shyamalan after the disaster of Lady in the Water, then it's back to the old drawing board.
3 ||| Shyamalan's approach is more effective than smash-and-grab plot-mongering. His use of the landscape is disturbingly effective. The performances by Wahlberg and Deschanel bring a quiet dignity to their characters.
2 ||| The film becomes less comprehensible as it goes along, and the audience -- expecting a patented M. Night ending -- is left with no answers, explanation, or narrative closure.
1 ||| You feel like you're not watching the end of the world but the end of a career.
0 ||| The greatest excuse yet to get that anti-M. Night petition started. The last thing we want is a future of Shyamalan films with the knowledge that we all could have done something sooner.
2 ||| Shyamalan crafts a somewhat chilling cautionary tale; it just might have been more chilling if he had been a little less cautious.
2 ||| M. Night Shyamalan has morphed from "the next Spielberg" to a punching bag for critics and audiences alike. The Happening reminds us why.
2 ||| Shyamalan's latest film is the first in a long time that I can't defend.
2 ||| If what audiences are looking for is a thrill ride, or even a pervasive eeriness, The Happening's just not happening.
2 ||| The Happening features an effectively stylized physical environment: rarely have clouds drifting overhead and wind blowing through trees and a sunny day been filmed so ominously.
1 ||| The Happening is a film of such shockingly appalling writing, dreadful acting and ham-fisted, ungainly execution that it plays better as a comedy than the thriller it was meant to be.
3 ||| An impressive thriller which acknowledges the mystery that lies behind the marvels and the terrors of the natural world.
1 ||| Bad and weird.
2 ||| Another disappointment from M, despite some disturbing violence and chilly moments.
3 ||| A tantalising, sometimes frustrating parable about the menaces that human beings might face from unexpected quarters.
2 ||| If you have seen the trailers online or on T.V., you can just save your money and wait for the rental on this one. All of the best moments are in the promos.
2 ||| Shyamalan's essentially made a sociopathic movie.
2 ||| It's clear that a once creative director is now running out of fumes, trying extremely hard to find something that hasn't been done before. The result is laughable.
2 ||| Where the hell is Act III?
3 ||| While there are certainly ideas behind it, the film lacks the bloated self-importance that plagued the director's last two efforts. This time, Shyamalan seems content merely to entertain us, and that's enough.
2 ||| On a brighter note, the Wayans brothers have new material to make Scary Movie 5.
1 ||| A creepy cautionary eco-thriller than neither cautions nor thrills. Instead of being full of dread, it's just dreadful.
1 ||| What's more annoying than when a mediocre movie constantly males allusions to much better pictures? I know, it's when you wait an hour and a half for a solution this pathetic.
0 ||| Ouch. 'Lady in the Water' was a dud. And for its ghastliness, filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan took one to the chin. He got back up again, though, to make 'The Happening.'This one's gonna hurt.
0 ||| ... M. Night desperately needs to find that special someone whose opinion he'll listen to when they say,'No! BAD writer-producer-director! NOT a good idea!'
2 ||| 'The Happening' works in early spurts, but apparently Shyamalan ran out of ideas once he came up with his uniquely insidious killer.
2 ||| I did find myself caught up in Shyamalan's apocalyptic world for a time -- before some really bad dialogue or acting would shake me out of it.
1 ||| A monster movie desperately seeking a monster, M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening doesn't make sense, much less The Sixth Sense.
2 ||| It's engrossing one minute and stupefying the next, off and on, off and on, for ninety minutes.
3 ||| For Night, The Happening is a little blip on his career flatline. The guy just may pull through.
2 ||| The true disaster on display in The Happening is Shyamalan's career hitting rock bottom.
2 ||| ...a minor, not quite successful film, but for M. Night Shyamalan - whose career has been circling the drain for some time now - it's a step back from the abyss.
1 ||| Só podemos deduzir que o próximo projeto de Shyamalan será melhor do que este Fim dos Tempos porque sabemos que ele (ou qualquer outro cineasta) dificilmente seria capaz de fazer algo pior.
2 ||| Rather than [the R-rating]being an opportunity-opening device for writer/director Shyamalan to pull out of his toolbox, the graphic violence that got him that rating is more like a monkey wrench.
1 ||| Nothing 'happening' here
1 ||| Other than its ripe possibility for mockery, I cannot think of anything that makes the film really worthwhile.
2 ||| When a movie's best bit arrives during the closing credits, we're all in trouble.
1 ||| The slight premise, coupled with some very bad performances by the cast as well as a screenplay filled with ham-fisted dialogue makes for a film that's not scary and borders on being ridiculous at times.
2 ||| What you end up with is a cross between Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow and Shyamalan's Signs.
2 ||| ...some nice creepy moments -- but other moments, and more, of (presumably) unintended humor.
2 ||| Shyamalan's ideas might have more impact in a half-hour 'Twilight Zone' episode, where they would be shorn of some of the pretensions that seem to be mandatory in the feature-length work of a one-time Best Director Oscar nominee.
2 ||| It's hard to believe that at one time Shyamalan was being touted as the next Steven Spielberg by Newsweek magazine, but if things keep going the way they are now, Uwe Boll might end up being a better comparison. And boy is that depressing.
2 ||| Mark Wahlberg's sturdy performance saves The Happening from becoming a protracted Saturday Night Live spoof of M. Night Shyamalan movies.
0 ||| I'm shaking my head now like a caring teacher grading a poor assignment written by a bright student.
2 ||| There are some creepy moments but overall The Happening is a bit of a non-event.
2 ||| This major studio release asks the question, how long can you survive on past glories? Shame on Shyamalan.
0 ||| Holy Mother of God...this is awful.
1 ||| Un nuevo fiasco de M. Night Shyamalan, que sigue siendo un director con ideas interesantes (tanto argumentales como visuales) pero que necesita urgentemente la ayuda de un buen guionista.
2 ||| Shyamalan creates another urban myth with this slow burning thriller. But it never quite comes to life, due to stiff directing and acting
2 ||| Shyamalan's religious ideas are a lot like Bush's: Nearly theology free.
2 ||| The M. Knight brilliance is there in quick jolts of suspense and terror, but those moments are the exception in this otherwise flat little thriller.
2 ||| Shyamalan is a master at a visual iconic moment - but the "filler" (you might have learned about it in English class by this name: "story") gets weaker and weaker every film.
2 ||| Shyamalan's latest is an improvement, but a full-fledged comeback ain't happening.
2 ||| It's a great idea. A silent, unknown killing machine knocking people off while a science teacher tries to figure out why. But it just didn't work.
1 ||| While not as laughable as the narcissistic Lady in the Water ,it fails just as miserably as narrative and even more miserably with its flat characters and tone deaf dialogue.
2 ||| Undoubtedly M. Night Shyamalan's weakest thriller to date...
1 ||| More than anything, what bothers me about it is a sense of cheapness that ... centrally comes from a concept mainly built for shock value.
1 ||| Seeing The Happening is like going on an outing with an earnest person, who happens to be a drunk. Every time it starts to make sense, it slurs its speech and starts dropping things -- such as coherence and credibility.
1 ||| Shyamalan sve lo%u0161ije reagira na gubitak statusa holivudskog bo%u017Eanstva
2 ||| Horror film is long on peril, but thin on plot.
2 ||| At first, a great deal happens, then nothing much happens for quite some time, then something so underwhelming happens that one is left wondering, 'Did that really just happen?'
1 ||| Wahlberg is atrocious, as wooden as the trees terrorising him.
2 ||| Ultimately it doesn't work -- scenes intended to be played straight become unintentionally funny due to Wahlberg's star turn being so gormless.
2 ||| You know pretty early on what's likely causing "the happening," and yes, there's a message here.
2 ||| It's distant, aloof and painfully self-aggrandizing, clearly overconfident in its ability to scare the audience.
2 ||| Even the most fervent M. Night fan will be forced to consider the film one of his weakest efforts.
2 ||| Tirard's risk-free approach of of the life of French comedy's reformer, is as light-hearted and cooky, as Lassel Hallstrom's Casanova, just starring Moliere instead of the infamous womanizer, albeit with a much more European cast.
2 ||| The film begins on a serious note, requiring an adjustment on the part of the audience toward its more prevalent comic tone. Once that transition is made, the experience of Moliere is an enjoyable one.
2 ||| A very silly film.
3 ||| All in all, it's a breezy, jestful and enjoyable divertissement, in which Duris is given free rein to showcase his considerable versatility.
3 ||| Enjoyable, frequently amusing and surprisingly romantic French romp with a witty script, superb performances and a subtle message about the value of comedy.
4 ||| While this film is rather talky and a long, it's also a wonderfully complex blend of wit and cheekiness, underscored by a surprisingly serious romance and a steely view of the battle of the sexes.
2 ||| A bit curate's eggy, sometimes funny and always goodlooking, but neither a particularly good tribute to a great playwright nor a comedy with much weight behind it.
2 ||| It's impossible to avoid comparison with Shakespeare in Love, which similarly made out that many of the great man's plays were really disguised autobiography; but the earlier film had a lightness of touch and variety of tone missing from this one.
3 ||| Just as you should never judge a book by its cover, never judge a film by its press release. Moliere was the most touching, funny film on show this week.
3 ||| It's a wonderfully witty film - très bien, in fact.
3 ||| Both a glittering showcase for a literary giant's comic genius and a first-class farce in its own right. By turns funny, mysterious, suffering and sexy, Romain Duris again proves he's the most charismatic French actor working today.
3 ||| When the French do period drama well, they tend to do it very, very well.
2 ||| Romain Duris may be a superb actor, but a light comedian he ain't. You need a very sweet tooth for this kind of thing.
2 ||| The film feels distinctly skinny, as if half the cast haven't arrived. The symmetry of the story is almost too perfect. Several leaps of faith are wildly silly.
3 ||| A witty, lively period drama that expertly blends comedy and tragedy to create a worthy French counterpart to Shakespeare In Love.
2 ||| Light of touch but overlong, this is saved by a sparkling performance from Romain Duris.
2 ||| The Shakespeare in Love song remains the same, only the lyrics have changed.
3 ||| An especially endearing attempt at the budding subgenre.
3 ||| A funny, witty, bright, and well-acted costume drama about a fictional turning point in the life of the famous French playwright Moliere.
3 ||| Duris, so good in The Beat that My Heart Skipped, is simply marvelous here. His Molière is a complex creature of intelligence, insecurity, sincerity, obstinacy and burgeoning brilliance.
2 ||| Festooned with oodles of museum-worthy 17th century sets and costumes, Moliere is the sort of slightly naughty but literate frolic that congratulates the audience for its good taste; in other words, it's a bit of a snooze.
2 ||| A well-played but ultimately superfluous assortment of your favorite Moliere scenes strung together by a thread-thin plot that emulates, but in no way replaces, the still-sparkling originals.
4 ||| One of the year's best films to date.
3 ||| A period piece enlivened with slapstick and mischievous wit.
2 ||| This movie about the crucible of imagination has none of its own.
2 ||| Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, better known as Molière, wrote more than 30 plays, every one of them a hundred times more witty and insightful than the movie Molière.
3 ||| The actors elevate what might have been fluff into a genuinely moving tale, and the action is so much fun that it doesn't even matter if you've seen Molière's plays before.
3 ||| A sweet and silly comedy reminiscent of Shakespeare in Love, it's lushly filmed and gorgeously set and costumed.
2 ||| Molière is a restful diversion, perhaps too restful, but still acceptable. And the actors go a long way toward bringing it off.
3 ||| A delightful romp with an intriguing story that could have been cut by 30 minutes and not missed a beat.
3 ||| A blithe but satisfying French confection.
2 ||| Director and co-writer Laurent Tirard's pleasant but tame approach to his birth-of-a-major-world-dramatist portrait has its virtues.
2 ||| Underplays its biggest opportunities for laughs, like the film is standing at the plate but unwilling to swing the bat.
2 ||| Woefully miscast as the seminal 17th-century French farceur Molière, the intense, black-maned young French movie star Romain Duris never seems more comfortable than the brief moments when he's rotting in a dank jail.
3 ||| Moliere is an amusing mix of fact and fiction about the life of the brilliant 17th-century French playwright.
2 ||| In making a comedy about a writer famed for his perfectly tuned wit, the filmmakers have inspired other expectations. The result is as off-putting as biting into a confection in which the sugar has been replaced by salt.
2 ||| Moliere hardly matches the clever mockery of its 17th century inspiration.
2 ||| Through homage to Moliere's works and by the film's own example, [director] Tirard reminds us that comedy can provoke both laughter and thought.
2 ||| As a piece of speculative biography, the movie is unpersuasive.
3 ||| It nevertheless contains enough wit and charm to keep things humming along even when the plot threatens to bog down into a Gallic version of a typical episode of "Love American Style."
3 ||| If you've enjoyed Moliere's work, you'll enjoy the film.
3 ||| Like the playwright's comedies, at its best Moliere shows the depths beneath the archetypes.
2 ||| Lost in the exercise is any insight into Molière's writing or any relevance to today, making his achievements seem more frivolous -- and considerably less amusing -- than they actually were.
2 ||| Director and cowriter Laurent Tirard are clearly under the sway of Shakespeare in Love, but the talented Duris is miscast as the wily Moliere, and Moliere has none of Shakespeare's giddy charm.
2 ||| I can only wonder what theatre gods Molière angered during his lifetime to deserve such ragtag biographical treatment, but let's hope Molière settles the debt.
2 ||| The unraveling of this same world, 100 years later, was portrayed in Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, next to whose gilded atmosphere the merely glossy Molière looks like a work of naturalism.
2 ||| The cast is very good. The chemistry between Duris and Morante smolders, while Luchini makes a convincing, bungling aristocrat.
2 ||| Connoisseurs of Sun King-era costumes and decor are the most likely fans of this impeccably produced but unimaginative pseudo-biopic...
2 ||| There's not a single moment that you haven't already seen in a different, better period film.
1 ||| The film illuminates little about Molière himself, but what do you expect from a movie that has the depth of a kiddie pool?
3 ||| "Moliere" actually tells a funny, involving story that really does seem inspired by its subject, rather than just lazily cribbing from his work.
3 ||| As the film picks up momentum, however, it becomes the story of an aimless young man who discovers his own brilliant wit and learns how to use it. As he gets closer to the scathing, fearless Moliere we know and love, so does the movie.
3 ||| For theater people and French literature buffs...a delightful game of spot-the-reference...
2 ||| Un cuadro social de época vivaz y divertido, con estupendo elenco y una cuota de romance y emotividad.
3 ||| A breezy historical romance with a strong knack for comedy.
2 ||| Deluxe tribute to the playwright gets by, surprisingly, as much by romantic poignancy as farce...it's hard to dislike a picture so in Love with its subject.
3 ||| A sophisticated and literate biographical speculation is the basis of this witty and entertaining portrait of the titular artist.
2 ||| Exploitative and depressing.
2 ||| The violence may be too strong for some but this is worth seeing for a terrific performance by Gillian Anderson.
1 ||| Masculinity in Crisis, part 364.
2 ||| Payback involving a shotgun, a kitchen table and a heap of pain.
2 ||| Even if Straightheads looks as if it was made for about 4, it(TM)s been a long time since someone was brave enough to make a such a movie.
2 ||| Make no mistake: this lo-fi rape-revenge Brit flick wants to shock you.
1 ||| This nasty and nonsensical rape-revenge thriller is a feature-length exercise in wrongness.
2 ||| Straightheads has the pornographic ingredients of a first-rate cult thriller.
2 ||| Where's Mulder when you need him.
2 ||| Anderson bares (almost) all in this flawed but fitfully fascinating thriller with a comical, if less compelling, turn from Danny Dyer.
2 ||| Feels like an experiment in suspense and violence that doesn't actually tell us anything
2 ||| The film looks professional and has a relatively big-name star in Gillian Anderson, but the screenplay - written by director Dan Reed - doesn't make a single bit of sense.
3 ||| About how some of us would be willing to sell our souls to protect our loved ones if we had to...
2 ||| ...a low-key drama disguised as a revenge thriller...
2 ||| Straightheads is as shallow as a puddle and forgoes anything approaching realism in favour of OTT violence and needless gore.
3 ||| Berman balances the weight of the actual events with the desire to mount a simply effective horror story, and I think he pulls it off quite well.
2 ||| Every once in awhile, a film can defy expectations, and Lionsgate's Borderland is one such case.
3 ||| An unnerving, ruthless, borderline-mesmerizing thriller.
2 ||| ...one can't help but admire any film that features a villain with a penchant for saying things like "I'll decorate my bedroom wall with your skin"...
3 ||| Borderland teeters between a torture film and a spiritual thriller, but it also plays around with both genres in very intriguing ways.
3 ||| "The camera moves are jarring at times and soothing at others ... a skillful, well crafted piece."
2 ||| Note to the writers: Just because a movie is a mystery doesn't mean everything in it has to be.
3 ||| Spiral is a joy to behold on every level.
4 ||| Is a much different film than "Hatchet." It's focused, it's low key, it's original, and it really takes its plot seriously...
3 ||| A surprisingly engrossing two-person character study that (gradually) reveals something quite a bit darker beneath the surface.
2 ||| one long, slow buildup to a surprise ending that conceals two or three twisting secrets while still remaining elusive and open to interpretation.
2 ||| ...a misguided and thoroughly pointless piece of work.
2 ||| Disappointingly uncharacteristic of Sokurov, the humanist moments that pass between them lean toward token sentiment, and the moments that pass between Alexandra and the grandson she traveled so far to see feel inconsequential.
1 ||| Koyrasmenos dimioyrgika kai thematika, o Sokurov prosferei mia faflatadiki dokimi ton orion tis katatonias
1 ||| I found it incredibly hard to care about either the grandmother or the young men and, since there is no plot to hold your interest, torpor ensues.
3 ||| hits on something painful and intrinsically human: the feeling of inevitable disillusionment
4 ||| Russian director Alexander Sokurov brings a political edge to the intra-family dynamics with this relatively straightforward tale of a grandmother's trip to an embattled region of Russia for a visit with her grandson.
3 ||| Alexandra is a much more modest undertaking, but is just as compelling. And Galina Vishnevskaya, an 81-year-old opera singer, is wonderful as Alexandra.
4 ||| Alexander Sokurov's Alexandra feels like a communiqué from another time, another place, anywhere but here.
3 ||| The mixture of the surreal and concrete feels remarkably accurate: a verité depiction of war with a profound ghostly quality.
3 ||| It's a well-acted piece that finds a unique way to discuss the fortunes of soldiers and their families during times of war.
3 ||| The images are indelible, if somewhat inscrutable (knowing Russian history would probably help, I suppose), but the message behind them rings out like a warning alarm.
4 ||| Sokurov's excellent new Alexandra begins with an almost laughable scenario.
4 ||| In the hands of visionary filmmaker Alexander Sokurov, this simple material makes for a haunting drama about war, generational relationships and the human condition.
4 ||| Alexandra is a pleasure to watch, but it's also one of those lovely, unclassifiable movies that flourishes better with repeated or prolonged exposures.
3 ||| The sepia tones and the claustrophobic camerawork are instantly recognizable as Sokurov's work, and so is the emphasis on family intimacy.
3 ||| Clever scenario looks at the balance of power betwween age, sex, and nationality
2 ||| Interesting look at life in the Russian military, but to what purpose?
4 ||| The film is built on a massive incongruity: Watching this octogenarian drag her little bent-up wheeled luggage cart, amid rolling tanks and military transport trucks, you're looking at two eternal verities%u2014war, and civilians caught up in its wake%u20
4 ||| Remarkable, how little Sokurov tells us, while telling us so much.
4 ||| Here is what filmmaking looks like at its absolute best: a movie of bold and aggressive originality that expresses itself with the utmost delicacy.
3 ||| Perhaps Sokurov's film will leave some viewers as weary as its protagonist, but this intimate and evocative journey through war is well worth taking.
3 ||| Sokurov is able to say things about the terrible conflict without obvious polemic but to the maximum possible effect. That's largely why he is one of the most audacious and original directors in the world today.
2 ||| His sepia images of war's futility are beautiful, and Vishnevskaya's face is a compelling one, but they cannot compensate for the soporific anti-narrative.
3 ||| Shot in shades of bleached-out khaki brown and augmented by a heart-rending orchestral score, it's a unique and intensely moving elegy for wasted lives.
2 ||| It's a film of small details rather than big gestures...and all the more powerful for it.
3 ||| A bone-weariness pervades every inch of the film; even the light is bleached dry of vitality.
2 ||| Apart from a thoroughly irritating background track of schmaltzy classical music, this is Sokurov at his shortest and most digestible.
3 ||| It's also quietly challenging, in its own way, not least in its portrait of old age, its trials, new freedoms and the privilege of changing one's mind before it becomes too late.
3 ||| This is war as stalemate, with Aleksandr Burov's bleached images creating an alien landscape in which colour is as rare as compassion. Rarely has combat seemed so savage or futile.
4 ||| A rich and rewarding film, a deeply humanist work of art that is as tender as it is bracing.
3 ||| 'A small house can accommodate hundreds of friends, but can't accommodate two enemies,' the doctor says ruefully, quoting an Arab proverb. Sadly, Blood and Tears is the proof.
3 ||| As the film progresses, it becomes increasingly bold in taking sides, while all the time pretending to be unbiased.
2 ||| Though refreshingly reluctant to take sides regarding geography of the matter, the film has a subtle slant toward peace.
2 ||| Morgan Neville's quick-paced documentary The Cool School recounts the rise and fall of Ferus Gallery and the mark it made on American art.
4 ||| A lively film that doesn't linger too long on any one thought or with any one interviewee.
3 ||| No one emerges very well defined from this historical shuffle, but those who know the artists' works, or names such as Hopps and Blum, but have never heard them speak, will find The Cool School absorbing and informative.
2 ||| Largely avoids sharply delineated portraits, with its focus on the scene at the expense of individuals, ultimately resulting in a documentary that doesn't rise above the functional.
3 ||| Though designed more for the devotee of the arts than your average moviegoer, the film is still apt to enthrall even the uninitiated who wouldn't know a Jackson Pollock from a Willem de Kooning.
3 ||| Surf's up in Southern California as the modern art world invades Nixonville and Reagan City in the 1950s. A fascinating look at the start of something big: modern art in Los Angeles.
3 ||| Thoughtful and thought-provoking.
2 ||| Diverting.
3 ||| The Cool School, a breezy, lively documentary about a thin slice of the Los Angeles fine art scene in the 1950s, is easy on the eyes, and the ears too.
3 ||| Cool School is a must for anyone interested in 20th century American art.
3 ||| Sweeps you off your feet with quick-witted visuals and cleverly used archival footage.
3 ||| Makes the case that there's more than basket weaving and freeway driving going on in the seedbed of originality we know as the Great Basin of L.A.
2 ||| Breezy doc lives up to its title.
2 ||| The Cool School is neither as lively nor as complete as it could be, but as an introduction to modern art, it's a fine freshman course.
2 ||| The Cool School is a history of the LA art scene which will be most interesting for those who are involved in it.
3 ||| Occasionally too reverent, this remains an effective evocation of a vibrant and interesting art scene, not to mention a touching paean to lost youth.
2 ||| Morgan Neville's 'The Cool School' is a slickly packaged document of the burgeoning modern art scene in LA during the late '50s and early '60s which sadly submerges its fascinating subject matter in technical clutter and contrived set-ups.
3 ||| An intense, sexy medical thriller that gives us a glimpse of what CSI would look like if it were a horror.
2 ||| Medical thriller mixes extreme violence, sex.
3 ||| If you are a hardcore fan of films like FLATLINERS, I guarantee that you'll dig this flick... PATHOLOGY is really a gem that doesn't deserve to be overlooked.
3 ||| One of the more effective and chilling thrillers released this year.
2 ||| Not exactly a great movie, but it's sick, slick, and strange enough to warrant a 90-minute look.
1 ||| This is the film that should have been called "Coma"
2 ||| Slickly made but utterly gratuitous, this wannabe-edgy thriller was an odd choice for Ventimiglia to make during his first Heroes hiatus.
3 ||| Even squeamish viewers are apt to be captivated by the tight, credible scripting; these 20-somethings talk and behave like today's irony-clad young sophisticates. And whatever your opinion of the subject matter, you can't fault the filmmaking.
2 ||| Gleefully brimming with body parts and bad behavior, Pathology is a fun piece of flamboyant tastelessness.
1 ||| Existing somewhere in a world between Flatliners, Saw and Last Tango in Paris, this oversexed, over the top, underwritten medical horror flick won't come anywhere near the success of those films.
2 ||| Comes off as a semi-absurd variant of the horror mystique cheating the potentials of impeccable production values.
2 ||| To put things into perspective, the campier "Saw" films are all better -- and more clever ...
2 ||| ...a sporadically compelling yet hopelessly inconsequential piece of work.
2 ||| A clear step in the right direction for Zemeckis and his pet techno-project, the film nonetheless ultimately sabotages itself by prizing the hectic over the heartfelt.
3 ||| The director has brought this Charles Dickens classic to such vivid life that in some ways you feel like you are experiencing it for the first time
2 ||| Zemeckis' motion-capture animated features continue to be odd presents, offering undeniable technical skill with a host of other obstacles hindering total enjoyment.
2 ||| Bob Hoskins looks just right as kind old Mr. Fezziwig, but that may be more of a testament to the actor's physiognomy than to the motion-capture process, which makes most of the film's cast look like they just sauntered out of Madame Tussauds.
3 ||| By the time it's over, you'll have to be a real Scrooge yourself to not have at least a little bit of the Christmas spirit instilled into you.
3 ||| This is a faithful retelling of the story, proving that strong tales such as these are better off without embellishment. The enhancements here come, not to the source material but to the look of the film, which is beautifully rendered in immersive 3D.
3 ||| Against the odds, this Disney version, written and directed by Robert Zemeckis, could be the best adaptation to date of the story.
3 ||| Charles Dickens' classic story hasn't been revitalized but it has been faithfully and capably recreated.
3 ||| Even as [Zemeckis] uses the 3D process to turn A Christmas Carol into a rollercoaster ride through a solidly built fantasy world, he never forgets that at bottom the tale is an awful warning about how egoism and greed can destroy your humanity.
2 ||| All style and no substance, Disney's A Christmas Carol is a yawn inducing retread of a tired fable.
3 ||| Utilizing performance-capture technology, it's intricate and ingenious, offering a 3-D fantasy/adventure thrill ride, soaring into the holiday season.
2 ||| 3-D adaptation of classic holiday tale may scare young kids.
3 ||| Children not already familiar with the past iterations of A Christmas Carol will be in heaven if they can get past the spookier elements, while the rest of viewers will be happy with, if not quite euphoric for, what Robert Zemeckis has cooked up.
2 ||| Just when you give up on it, usually in the middle of its latest, extraneous, gyroscoping thrill-ride sequence, Zemeckis reminds you that he's capable of true visual dynamism, enhanced but not wholly dictated by the digital landscape he so clearly adores.
2 ||| By the time A Christmas Carol finishes piling its many shiny presents with their many bells and whistles under the tree, there's no room left for tears for Tiny Tim. Bah humbug indeed.
3 ||| This motion-capture animated adaptation is a real Christmas cracker.
3 ||| Zemeckis' movie may lack the emotional impact of the 1951 British version of A Christmas Carol, starring Alastair Sim as a truly transformed and happy Scrooge. Nevertheless, it's a visual treat that respects and artfully enhances its source.
2 ||| Enough elements of Dickens's story remain for a viewer to be refreshed by Scrooge's change of heart, and to be moved by his rediscovery of the Christmas spirit that climaxes the story.
2 ||| A re-telling should either present a resonant or fresh thematic take. This Christmas Carol seems like a pale ghost of Dickens' magical Christmas classic.
2 ||| Carrey's performance as the miserly misanthrope is lost amid effects more typically encountered in theme-park and video-game adventures. (P.S.: Is it just me, or does it also peeve you that the Mouse House claims proprietary rights on Dickens' title?)
3 ||| It's nice of Hollywood to go to all the trouble but, honestly, Dickens doesn't need the help.
2 ||| It's an unengaging, dull adaptation that has nothing really new to say in regards to the already-much-told tale.
3 ||| Shockingly, the new film turns out to be very good, at times close to brilliant: a darkly detailed marvel of creative visualization that does well by Dickens and right by audiences -- when it's not trying to sell them a theme park ride.
2 ||| It's visually stunning and all, but this is one version of A Christmas Carol that the world can probably live without. Humbug!
2 ||| If you want realism, use actors. If you want animation, use your imagination. Sadly, imagination is missing from this technically impressive but emotionally inert film.
2 ||| It's eerie rather than wondrous.
2 ||| It's not that Carrey fails in this serious guise, but, rather, it strips the comic actor of everything that makes him so special.
1 ||| A leaden and ugly mess that offers all the emotional and dramatic heft of an exceptionally garish Christmas window display.
3 ||| Robert Zemeckis finds eye-popping, high-tech new life in Dickens' hoary chestnut.
2 ||| The best part of this Christmas Carol is the end, when the ugly animation metamorphoses back into the pages of a book.
4 ||| The story that Dickens wrote in 1838 remains timeless, and if it's supercharged here with Scrooge swooping the London streets as freely as Superman, well, once you let ghosts into a movie, there's room for anything.
2 ||| By Fezziwig, that story still works and tugs at the heart. It would even if each ghost's visit weren't scored with overly-suitable Christmas carols.
4 ||| In spite of its holiday trappings, A Christmas Carol is an incredibly bleak look into the deepest and darkest human fears, but it is also a vibrant celebration of our better natures.
2 ||| In this morality tale, which winds up playing like the advertisement for an amusement park ride, Scrooge is supposed to be afraid of the truth, not the ghosts.
2 ||| A refreshing update of Dickens' timeless tale.
2 ||| The whole enterprise is just so empty and pointless, a bunch of bland technical wizardry that will be dated in five years.
2 ||| Writer-director Robert Zemeckis follows Charles Dickens' 1843 novella, A Christmas Carol, so closely that he even makes the same error the author made with the first edition of the book.
2 ||| You don't need glasses -- 3-D or otherwise -- to see that this holiday release is too diluted for adults, too frightening for children, and too tiresome for just about everybody.
0 ||| A garish and tedious animated interpretation of the Charles Dickens classic that has neither heart nor soul.
2 ||| Boasts dazzling CGI effects and important moral lessons, but it suffers from excessive style over substance while lacking the genuine, unadulturated warmth, emotional resonance and soul of the Dickens classic.
2 ||| Scrooge's ultimate transformation to kindness and charity comes too late and is given little screen time. Carrey never gets a chance to be the funny comedian that has endeared him to his legion of fans.
2 ||| There are already so many great adaptions of the classic Dickens story %u2013 this one adds nothing but CGI and gimmicky 3D effects.
2 ||| Zemeckis seems unable to admit that the motion capture animation he's been using on The Polar Express and Beowulf is an artistic dead end.
3 ||| exactly what I expected from Zemeckis and company. With the Dickens story as the foundation, it's perfect for the holiday season
3 ||| Yes, Zemeckis does throw in a few gratuitous moments where things are flying at your face, but he ends up using enough restraint to ensure the 3D doesn't overwhelm your senses or take away from Dickens' stirring story about greed and redemption.
2 ||| The only major change Disney's A Christmas Carol takes with the source material is draining the humanity right out of it.
3 ||| In the end you don't have to analyze it... that tear in your eye tells you it's working.
2 ||| Too bad though, that for all the eye-popping spirits on screen, it lacks a soul.
3 ||| Although Dickens has been translated time and time again, this animated adventure is no humbug.
2 ||| Call me a Scrooge, but I'll pass on this synthetic version of that most humanistic of tales.
3 ||| Zemeckis' film preserves much of Dickens' original dialogue and detail while amplifying the utter ethereal strangeness of the ghosts.
3 ||| There's a lot of dark magic in this Dickensian Yuletide.
3 ||| Does this entertainment achieve a timelessness beyond its exquisite source material? Not even. Yet there's pleasure to be had and relief in feeling the filmmakers didn't Scrooge it up either.
3 ||| The movie may be yet another retelling of an iconic story, but visually it is often quite breathtaking.
2 ||| You don't identify with Scrooge at any point, nor is blatant fakery scary. Picture The Seventh Seal with sock puppets.
3 ||| A branded piece of shiny seasonal entertainment.
3 ||| all science and little sentiment
2 ||| It feels like Zemeckis wanted to make one movie (a socially relevant ghost story) and Disney wanted another (a Polar Express-type movie). It doesn't work.
2 ||| The good news about A Christmas Carol, then, is that Dickens' story -- the pure power of it, the grace and gentleness, the sensibility and sentiment of it -- cannot be drowned or destroyed no matter how many technicians and dollars are thrown at it.
2 ||| A splendidly mounted and visually imaginative animated 3D version of the classic novel.
4 ||| this is not the Scrooge McDuck or Mr. Magoo version of the classic Charles Dickens tale, this A Christmas Carol is the dark, challenging and frightening version of the story
2 ||| Cinematographer Robert Presley and the design team provide many instances of graphical triumph, influenced by silent cinema.
2 ||| As for this 'performance capture,' rife with characters sporting the annoying wandering eye, it might be time for an intervention, ghostly or not. You're a filmmaker, Mr. Z, not a puppeteer. Enough is enough.
2 ||| This Hollywood adaptation is as glossy as Christmas wrapping paper and just as disposable.
2 ||| A Christmas Carol should be as cosy and familiar as piping-hot tea and buttered, toasted crumpets, not a brain-battering sensory assault that feels like downing tequila shots on a rollercoaster.
2 ||| There is a weird lack of passion here, almost condescension, a sense that Scrooge's agonised moral journey into his past is potentially pretty dull, and so Zemeckis is always livening things up by whooshing the old miser excitingly through the night sky.
2 ||| Zemeckis has succeeded is transforming a staid and over-familiar story into a rip-roaring and viscerally powerful special effects chase-movie.
2 ||| The whizzing pyrotechnics aren't quite enough to make this a Christmas classic.
2 ||| A Christmas Carol is certainly set to win the nation's attention. With all this hype, we'd hoped for something a bit more special.
2 ||| It is an experience, being stunning to look at -- and you'll only get the full effect from seeing it on the big screen, rather than waiting for the DVD.
2 ||| Zemeckis brightens up the screen with beautiful visual effects but had trouble bringing anything new to this already amazing story that we have heard a million times before.
2 ||| Charles Dickens's reflective, universal story becomes fodder for a technological thrill ride starring a rough approximation of Jim Carrey.
3 ||| Sometimes the richness of the visual banquet threatens to leave viewers with Christmas afternoon indigestion yet never stops you feeling hungry for more.
3 ||| In a very real sense, this version of A Christmas Carol is the most faithful to Charles Dickens' original text ever filmed.
4 ||| A strikingly animated and thoroughly magical 3-D adaptation... that, counter to so many other versions, beautifully captures the darkly intense vibe of Dickens' ghost story.
2 ||| It's a heartwarmer that doesn't have much of a heart itself.
2 ||| If you want an entertaining period piece, you could do a lot worse than attend Robert Zemeckis' A Christmas Carol.
4 ||| A near-perfect blend of looks and heart.
2 ||| A technically proficient but disturbing adaptation (that) adopts a surprisingly macabre tone.
2 ||| It's like taking a Christmas wreath and dipping it in wax or laminating a Christmas card in plastic. Zemeckis risks creating another Yule ghoul: the Ghost of Christmas Without Soul.
2 ||| As the lead character, Carrey's CG-created body is spindly and bent, and he has fun with his vocal performance, turning every word into a strangled hiss.
2 ||| The use of 3-D leaves the not unpleasant sensation that snow is gently falling throughout the entire cinema. A respectable, high-tech stab at an old favourite but the Alastair Sim version remains the best.
2 ||| After round two in Jim Carrey vs. Holiday Classics, it's Carrey 2, Classics 0.
2 ||| Full of Christmas cheer this is not.
2 ||| Dickens purists can stay away. Others can feel free to sample the rollicking aerial views of Victorian London, the droll and scary elasticity of Carrey.
2 ||| Scores high on swooping visuals and meticulous draughtsmanship.
2 ||| There's no warmth from these spooky, human-modelled digitised automatons, who glide about like all-night trance festival-goers the morning after.
2 ||| Despite the obvious care given the story, at its heart it is a dry lump of coal. This "Christmas Carol" is curiously remote and cold.
4 ||| A Christmas Carol is a worthy stab at mixing old and new, a vintage tale done with some fresh dazzle and a reminder that the movies can still bring the wow.
2 ||| Leaves a lot to be desired, and it's a virtual grab bag of good ideas mixed with bad.
3 ||| [It's] not something you should say bah humbug to.
2 ||| At its best, this revamp gets the eerie oppressiveness of London fog and Marley's rattling chains just right -- we all know the moral, but Zemeckis does remind us what a spine-chilling yarn it is.
2 ||| Unfortunately, as good as the animation is, it never quite manages to bring any of the characters to life and the film fails to connect on an emotional level as a result.
3 ||| For most of us, all the surprises here are visual, and it's well worth seeing in 3D.
2 ||| As a movie to get you in the Christmas spirit, A Christmas Carol does its job nicely.
3 ||| A visual extravaganza with dazzling special effects.
1 ||| Really, who cares? The essence of the story has been lost in the process. Give me The Muppet Christmas Carol any day.
2 ||| There is an almost constant deadness to the eyes that is deeply distracting, while each person's movements are so ungainly and wild even Gumby would look at them all wandering around and wonder why they look so uncomfortably odd.
1 ||| Animatronic robots would feel more human than this.
2 ||| Mr. Zemeckis has always been a talented, if less than subtle, director. And his "Carol" is never dull. But it also never justifies its own existence.
3 ||| As a dedicated fan of Charles Dickens' works, I also am a dedicated fan of several versions of his classic "A Christmas Carol."
2 ||| Hold onto your mug of warm apple cider. This newest, action-packed version of A Christmas Carol could get a little bumpy.
4 ||| An exquisitely crafted visual experience.
1 ||| Seeming spawned from some ghoulish dream I felt nothing warm or symbolic of a tradition from this film.
2 ||| Are the less than perfectly executed bits supposed to set off the truly terrific ones, or are the truly terrific ones supposed to distract the viewing audience from the bits that go clunk in the night?
3 ||| Yes %u2014 I am giving A Christmas Carol a high rating. It is technical perfection and brilliantly done. However, it is too much Zemeckis, too much Carrey. Not enough Dickens.
2 ||| Robert Zemeckis seeks to answer the one question still remaining about the Dickens classic: What would the story look like if it were cast with figures from Madame Tussauds?
2 ||| Those who enjoy virtual roller-coaster rides and long falls from high places are encouraged to attend.
2 ||| The biggest surprise... is that it isn't absolutely dreadful. Perfectly pointless, maybe, but not dreadful.
3 ||| The motion capture animation is top-notch and it's hard not to be impressed with what Robert Zemeckis has wrought, even if there's the occasional sense he's pandering to an audience that can't get through a 90 minute story without a few yuks and a chase.
3 ||| Leaving aside the technology behind Robert Zemeckis' animated A Christmas Carol, this is the most satisfying version of Charles Dickens' oft-told tale in years.
2 ||| Jamais deixa de impressionar.
2 ||| It's a film so determined to make you notice it, that it comes across like an obnoxious child screaming, 'Look at me!'
3 ||| ... the heart of the story is there, and Zemeckis honors and respects it.
2 ||| The 3D isn't enough to justify yet another version of this familiar tale; the film seems more opportunistic than necessary.
3 ||| It is done with skill and imagination, and overseen by a director, Robert Zemeckis, who knows the value of occasionally quietening things down for a bit of tension or a precisely timed joke.
2 ||| Watching the humans in this live action/animation combo is like watching 'Zombies On Parade'
2 ||| If you're remaking a classic merely to one-up whoever remade it previously, is it really worth the effort? Fortunately, Jim Carrey decided not to waste a wasted opportunity.
2 ||| takes full advantage of the technologies available, but fails to illuminate or otherwise expand Dickens' story in any meaningful ways
2 ||| There's no heart, and I don't put it simply on the visuals that almost look real at times. Amazing 3D is the only thing this dark version does really well.
2 ||| Robert Zemeckis' infatuation with the motion-capture animation process has officially gone too far...
2 ||| There's a certain irony in having a timeless tale about a man finding his soul being told in the most soulless way possible
2 ||| What's good is very good and what's bad is sadly bad. I wish I could cut a montage of the sobering and well-thought-out segue from Present to Future, the swooping flights through London and Scrooge's amazing face.
2 ||| The effects work here is far beyond a tech wizard showing off; it's more like watching Zemeckis lose his mind. He seems so obsessed with what he can do with the FX that he doesn't stop to consider whether he should.
2 ||| click to read full review
2 ||| Just like a new cover version of a classic song, A Christmas Carol is all crisp technology, same ol' structure, and a lot of spirit as substitute for a lack of soul.
2 ||| With a price tag of $175 million, Zemeckis might have even been able to pinch some pennies by abandoning the mo-cap and filming A Christmas Carol in live action. Hmm, I sound a little like Scrooge. Bah humbug!
3 ||| The 1951 Alastair Sim version still ranks as the Number 1 Christmas Carol, but this mo-cap CGI animated version comes in a close second.
2 ||| Creepy animation and a somewhat tired retelling might have you longing for the Muppet adaptation instead. At least the film's 3D-designed visuals are breathtaking.
3 ||| Zemeckis's retelling of A Christmas Carol is solid, most importantly letting the story itself shine through where it naturally does.
2 ||| Bah humbug: Zemeckis and Carrey screw with Scrooge.
2 ||| A supernatural parable of terrifying, chain-rattling spirits and mind-warping time travel, with a theme of social responsibility that extends far beyond seasonal cheer.
2 ||| What the film suffers from is a want of common comfort, despite its nominally redemptive, happy ending.
3 ||| One cannot help but feel the same effect could have been accomplished by simply making a live action film with state-of-the-art visual effects.
3 ||| While for some there is something disconcerting about the lifeless eyes of the otherwise life like characters, it certainly lends itself to large 3D cinemas, with rubber faced characters and grand sweeping movement.
2 ||| This computerised version of A Christmas Carol automatically loses something in becoming very homogenised and, dare I say it, Americanised.
2 ||| A chilly, cold-to-the-touch interpretation.
2 ||| The elegant simplicity of Dickens' novel is lost somewhere underneath the eye-popping visuals, whittled down to nothing more than a series of pixels and binary code.
2 ||| Even though it is quite a loyal adaptation of the classic tale, A Christmas Carol doesn't quite manage to land as a Disney film. [Full Review in Spanish]
2 ||| Despite these advances in motion capture, A Christmas Carol still has some deficiencies. [Full Review in Spanish]
2 ||| [An] expertly assembled and engrossing documentary.
2 ||| A sad story, but well told, with respect for its subject and an eye for the Shakespearian tragedy in the tale.
3 ||| Stories celebrating heroic journeys are commonplace, but this is a sobering, anti-heroic tale of an ordinary man who set out to attempt the extraordinary... and failed through a cruel combination of bad luck and bad judgement.
3 ||| A true-life tale of inadvertent self-destruction, Deep Water's generic title belies its haunting incisiveness.
2 ||| Not only is this an incredible saga of Jack London proportions, it's also a great detective tale.
4 ||| Echoes the dark poetry of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner and Poe's Arthur Gordon Pym, men who sailed to sea in search of fortune only to encounter the abyss within themselves.
3 ||| His story is a footnote in sailing history, to be sure, but a fascinating one.
3 ||| Deep Water successfully combines the pressure of the competition with an intriguing character study of the increasingly desperate Crowhurst.
4 ||| Nearly 40 years after he attempted to transcend his everyday life of limited horizons and money troubles, Osmond and Rothwell offer a fitting tribute to Crowhurst and his impossible dream.
4 ||| Deep Water is a documentary, but it's also one part adventure film, one part Greek tragedy, and one part meditation on the role of the 'hero' in modern society.
4 ||| A fascinating documentary about the first single-handed around-the-world sailing race, begins like a Boy's Own adventure tale but ends up more akin to tragedy.
4 ||| Remarkable.
3 ||| The documentary effectively blends contemporary and recent interviews with film and tape recordings made by Crowhurst aboard the Electron.
4 ||| One of this year's better studies of the human soul.
2 ||| Osmond and Rothwell do a commendable job of mining a rich archive of material.
2 ||| To reveal Crowhurst's decision would be to spoil a stunning tale. Deep Water is not itself comparably stunning.
3 ||| ...a compelling portrait of a man who is terminally befuddled and ends up abandoning his wife and children because he can't face the music.
4 ||| A tangle of turbulent seas and emotions.
4 ||| But more startling are the original tape recordings and 16mm films made by the solitary competitors as they spent more than ten months alone trying to sail around the globe.
4 ||| For this gripping and amazing documentary, such truth emerges not just from the facts, but also the poetry of men who redefine themselves in a risky race on small sailboats.
4 ||| Some beautiful shots give unexpected texture to the film, such as an underwater capture of a boat from below, with prisms of light surrounding it. And its final image is a quiet heartbreaker.
3 ||| This is pretty heady stuff, and it's constantly enthralling, particularly for something that has to use so much second-hand information.
4 ||| Not merely a documentary portrait, but an engrossing drama with more twists and turns than your average thriller.
3 ||| Deeply researched and compellingly presented, Deep Water is as much about one man's misadventures on the ocean as it is about loneliness, desperation and the danger of dreams.
3 ||| The film evokes a visceral understanding of solitude at sea.
2 ||| This is fascinating stuff... that would be better served by a magazine article or book.
3 ||| As a portrait of obsession, competition and, finally, delusion, Deep Water is haunting and engrossing, and one of the best nonfiction movies of the year.
4 ||| Knowing in advance how it all turned out cannot rob this remarkable movie of any of its drama, although ignorance of the events probably adds to the kick.
3 ||| The details just get stranger and stranger.
3 ||| I do think the movie loses focus at times, but nevertheless, this is a pretty interesting story into madness.
3 ||| engaging
3 ||| Mike Reilly's film is so well put together and well acted that it was a joy to sit and watch what was an apparent work of love...
2 ||| ...this film -- despite its penchant for black-and-white narrative when many shades of grey are needed -- needs to be seen and discussed
2 ||| The reach of this film goes beyond addressing itself to one couple or even something as broad as the whole field of sports medicine.
4 ||| Resourcefully intriguing, sentimental and cunningly relevant, Road to Victory juggles its revolving subject matters with effortless candor and consideration.
3 ||| Road to Victory tackles sexual dysfunction with a delicacy that belies its gridiron backdrop.
3 ||| Reilly's directing revealed a solid eye for visual presentation and dramatic emphasis.
2 ||| Actually better than its premise and its trailer might lead you to expect.
2 ||| Upbeat talking-animal adventure is fun for kids.
1 ||| While CGI works its ventriloquism on the doggy mandibles, it neglects the human contingent, who are left to fend for themselves amid the manipulated menagerie.
1 ||| The good news is that "Beverly Hills Chihuahua" is not the 90-minute-long ethnic joke that the incessant trailers have been promising for the last few months. The bad news is that it isn't much of anything else either.
2 ||| An unfunny, uninventive live-action variation on animated Disney animal adventures Lady and the Tramp, Oliver and Company and The Aristocats.
2 ||| At first glance, it seems like just another 'cute' movie where we see life through the eyes of an animal. Your first glance would actually be pretty accurate but as far as this genre goes, the kids should love it and adults won't need to keep checking the
3 ||| Sublimely silly and oddly poignant, Beverly Hills Chihuahua -- that's right, the one with the talking canines -- is Lady and the Tramp for lap dogs, Roots for pooches, Legally Blonde told from Bruiser's point of view.
1 ||| A painfully unfunny, virtually charmless talking-animals pic. What did the lovely Jamie Lee Curtis see in this project that she felt warranted coming out of semi-retirement for?
3 ||| A surprise charmer that mixes family-friendly slapstick with shrewd adult humor.
2 ||| Like CNN, the film assumes it needs nothing more than our unlimited interest in the drama of a white female gone missing in a foreign country.
3 ||| Sure, it's essentially Legally Blonde told from a dog's perspective, down to Chloe's newfound self-awareness, but darned if it isn't awfully cute.
2 ||| In a year light on family films, this may be a good bet. Exciting adventure, admirable messages, and good, clean fun--but be warned, its bite is worse than its bark!
2 ||| Paris Hilton and lower-level office workers who own calendars featuring Weimaraners wearing hats will love it.
3 ||| If celebrity purebred Tinkerbell sees this canine consciousness-raiser, there could be a putsch in Paris Hilton's purse.
1 ||| [During the credits]Disney warns people to be careful when picking a dog and that all dogs deserve a good home. If only they were that concerned about their movie.
2 ||| It's hard to go wrong with a movie full of talking dogs. But the makers of Beverly Hills Chihuahua sure try.
1 ||| For most of Beverly Hills Chihuahua, all I could think about was Drew Barrymore. What might she have been up to while she recited her lines for Chloe, the spoiled yet sad-looking live-action Chihuahua that speaks in her voice.
2 ||| Disney is now content with the likes of the wholly inoffensive, uninventive Beverly Hills Chihuahua, whose canine antics will divert undemanding youngsters and adults who believe the simple absence of profanity, sex and violence counts as a virtue.
2 ||| Beverly Hills Chihuahua is hardly Best in Show when it comes to Disney dog movies.
2 ||| In the words of another famous talking dog, Beverly Hills Chihuahua looks like something for me to poop on.
3 ||| A Lady and the Tramp for the Taco Bell set, Beverly Hills Chihuahua fits nicely into the long line of Disney dog movies designed to delight children and animal lovers.
2 ||| Despite its superficial lip-service to self-actualization/realization, there has to be more to life than what Beverly Hills Chihuahua is putting out there, which is fit for neither man nor beast.
2 ||| A live-action movie with a boatload of cute pooches that, despite bewitching effects and a charming voice cast, buries its sentiment in a too-tangled tale.
2 ||| The film is Beverly Hills Chihuahua. The audience is the fire hydrant.
2 ||| Beverly Hills Chihuahua approaches but never quite achieves a truly spectacular level of absurdity.
2 ||| If Chihuahua is no Babe or Charlotte's Web, at least it's in the Alvin and the Chipmunks ballpark. Just remember nobody went to the pet store and grabbed a chipmunk on the way home after that one.
3 ||| It's still only October, but I'll go ahead and say it: Beverly Hills Chihuahua is the best film of 2008 starring a purse dog.
3 ||| Depending on your tolerance for talking Chihuahuas, this live-action comic offering from Disney could make for a fun family night out.
3 ||| Chihuahua turns out to be a pretty good family comedy that is more than the sum of its effects.
3 ||| Most movies in the talking-dog genre -- yes, unfortunately, there are enough of them to be a genre -- feature dogs doing stand-up shtick. But the pooches in Beverly Hill Chihuahua have character, and so does the movie.
2 ||| Aside from some obvious racial stereotypes and voices that occasionally stray into Frito Bandito territory, Chihuahua has charm to spare for the adults, while offering plenty to keep young pups enthralled.
2 ||| Ticket buyers older than 8 should simply close their eyes and ponder a more stimulating concept: Beverly Hills Cujo.
2 ||| If I were six, maybe even seven, I think I would have adored Walt Disney Picture's talking dog comedy Beverly Hills Chihuahua.
0 ||| some will think this is a cute funny movie, and the rest of us will go running and screaming from the theater begging God to take away our eyesight so we never have to see it again
2 ||| The predictable story may be enough to keep dog-obsessed children entertained, assuming they don't get distressed by the pups-in-peril aspects, but for adults it's only sporadically entertaining.
2 ||| Quite sweet.
2 ||| a shallow cinematic shill at best.
2 ||| For the seven year olds out there, this is a perfectly fun movie and there's nothing that a cranky film critic can say to sour the experience.
1 ||| The script's one original idea, a lost Aztec city populated solely by militant chihuahuas, comes too late to save this dog of a movie.
1 ||| In less enlightened times those responsible for making animals talk would have been burnt at the stake as sorcerers. That's why those times were known as 'the good old days.'
2 ||| Kids movies over the past few years have proven they can be just as good as grown up films (WALL*E), but this one brings us back to the drawing board.
3 ||| A doggone good movie for kids
1 ||| Tremendously routine, in a way that an adventure film about talking Chihuahuas should not be.
2 ||| It's a happy report that the preview's bark is far worse than the movie's bite. There is a Chihuahua brigade (fronted by Placido Domingo, no less), but thankfully no musical numbers. It's a modestly charming old-dog family film with few new tricks.
2 ||| Beverly Hills Chihuahua is by no means a good movie, but as plain-old bad ones go, it's as generic and inoffensive as they come.
2 ||| ...a sort of live-action hybrid of Lady and the Tramp and Saludos Amigos...
3 ||| Awwww, chihuahua!
2 ||| What is more confusing, the spelling of the word Chihuahua or how a movie this dull has been number one at the box office two weekends in a row?
3 ||| A single moment of magical realism shows the Babe-that-might-have-been, very charitably speaking, had the makers of this doggie adventure-comedy chosen a more daring and creative route...
2 ||| The terminally cutesy Chihuahua is just another demonstratively derivative kids' narrative that barks up the wrong creative tree...[a] forgettable fleabag farce...
2 ||| What doesn't make sense is that while the doggies can follow human speech, the humans don't get pooch talk, it's all Yap-Yapanese.
2 ||| It's hugely silly, but peppy enough to be tolerable. What grates most are the patronising racial stereotypes: the dirty Mexican dogs are just waiting to be rescued by LA ladies and given a good bath.
2 ||| Younger audiences will adore this canine caper, though grown-ups might feel its one joke is stretched too far.
2 ||| In a triumph of animal wrangling and CGI tinkering, the canine cast turn in better performances than some of the humans.
2 ||| This piece of egregious silliness from Disney - featuring live-action canines with CGI moving mouths - isn't quite as awful as it sounds.
2 ||| Not that anybody would expect perfection from a film called Beverly Hills Chihuahua, but the chewed bone of a story makes it all mutts ado about nothing.
2 ||| A state-of-the-art kid-pleaser for sure, but recession-weary parents will probably find it a mite obnoxious.
2 ||| This live-action Disney comedy is the kind of family film which is aimed not so much at parents, as small children and their goldfish, as long as the goldfish do not have too long an attention span.
2 ||| Only watch this if you adore seeing dogs wearing shades.
2 ||| It's put across with enough brio to excuse the inherent stupidity of the premise.
2 ||| You want to cringe as the picture begins, but you end up quite enjoying it.
2 ||| Watchable, largely average family movie, enlivened by decent performances and the occasionally surreal, off-the-wall moment.
2 ||| Silly beyond reason, it somehow manages to win us over despite our doubts, and by the end we're ashamed that we can't stop giggling.
2 ||| An appealing film for dog lovers and those seeking escapist entertainment.
1 ||| Gosnell gracelessly walks us through cheap, generic talking dog material, while parents everywhere groan silently to themselves.
2 ||| ...ultimately about as enthralling as a low-rent Saturday morning cartoon.
2 ||| A kid's film doesn't have to be an all time classic to be watchable - once anyway - for the whole audience. No one in Beverly Hills Chihuahua seems to care enough to bother. And if they don't care, why should I?
2 ||| Director Raja Gosnell actually makes this film work far better than one might expect it to work.
2 ||| The cast are uniformly good; it's all competent, but its somehow not completely satisfactory.
2 ||| As tales of troubled families go, it may have aspirations to be like Ordinary People, but it falls way short.
2 ||| A movie tomb in which zombiedom is confused with - what's the phrase? - "nuanced performances". Fireflies may be a douche to freshen up the thesp skills of A-listers, but why do we have to suffer for their art?
2 ||| Doesn't really have a plot, but it cleverly traces the interrelationships in a family over several years, and really gets under the skin
2 ||| It lacks dramatic impact and fails to deliver the required emotional punch.
2 ||| We're in the twilight land of the sensitive indie ensemble piece, something American stars gravitate to for reasons of range and prestige, but which ends up being more cathartic for them than for us.
1 ||| It's not a bad film - Lee directs with subtle grace and the cast is predictably strong - but it's saddled with too many characters, not enough drama and a strong sense of overfamiliarity.
2 ||| This is a slog of a melodrama. And with at least four sob stories competing for space, characters are left dangling like untied shoelaces, as backstories remain unfertilised.
2 ||| Julia Roberts, Willem Dafoe and Emily Watson are strictly slumming it in this saccharine melodrama.
2 ||| A sickly sweet family drama stuffed with exceptionally high-profile performers - so much so that they threaten to overwhelm it just by their presence.
2 ||| A heavy, entertaining but slightly forgettable family drama.
2 ||| The entire experience feels like it is leading up to a dramatic and well-needed climax, but sadly this never materialises and what we're left with is a run-of-the-mill yarn, albeit one with a stellar cast.
2 ||| It may be both both melancholy and intense but it packs an emotional jolt as the prodigal son reaches an understanding - if not a full-blown reunion - with his crotchety old man.
2 ||| An impressive ensemble lends heft and humour to this sprawling potboiler. Watchable if never truly memorable, it's a mid-range work for most involved that still affords the odd guilty pleasure.
2 ||| A sheer slog to sit through, Fireflies In The Garden might have worked if it wasn't so damn po-faced and the script actually had something to say about how families work.
2 ||| The elements are all there but never fully click into place - more like a TV movie than a big-screen drama.
2 ||| A thoughtful tale but it is not original enough to provide a long-lasting glow.
2 ||| Consistently watchable and sometimes rather moving, although it is a rather slighter piece than the film-makers seem to think.
2 ||| An agonisingly sincere drama of familial dysfunction, this is notable for some very basic miscasting.
2 ||| A resolutely middlebrow dysfunctional family melodrama, it's one of those tediously self-congratulatory movies that projects an unearned air of superiority simply because it's not another slam-bang summer blockbuster.
2 ||| A watchable but ultimately blah family drama.
1 ||| It's a tragedy, in all of the wrong ways.
3 ||| The relationships are lived-in and complex, with the same hopelessness that we find in real life. People don't change.
2 ||| Lee doesn't trust his storytelling or the audience.
2 ||| "Fireflies" is probably too convoluted to pave the way for more roles of this sort, but watching Reynolds get inside Michael's pain, you hope it won't be long until something will.
2 ||| Has all the personality and forward momentum of a cardboard box.
2 ||| A fraught family drama that shows us the same family in past and present, 22 years apart. It might have been more effective if it had followed a chronological order.
1 ||| This locally shot weeper is unhappy in myriad ways, few of which manage to coalesce around its heart-stung core.
1 ||| This stale drama is finally getting a limited release and will prove just how limited it is to the poor saps who pay to see it.
1 ||| A dispiriting rehash of dysfunctional family clichs that seems to last longer than Thanksgiving Day dinner.
2 ||| The actors are all good and a few scenes -- an opening family argument, a crucial battle when Michael finally fights back -- are painfully moving.
1 ||| An unrelentingly grim drama about yet another dysfunctional family.
2 ||| It just comes off a little false.
1 ||| The constant shifting between past and present is handled so badly that it adds absolutely nothing to the proceedings.
0 ||| Just when you're hitting your tolerance breaking point for these people and their nonstop bellyaching and yelling and baffling hatred for one another, the equally baffling reconciliation kicks in. What just happened?
2 ||| Uneven drama about unhappy family, including tragedy.
2 ||| The strength of Fireflies in the Garden undoubtedly lies in its casting, although [Dennis] Lee directs his starry cast with confidence and flair and this should lead on to bigger and better things for the young film-maker.
2 ||| Dull, clichéd, and silly, this is yet another watered-down slice of horror cinema that will score big with teenage girls under the age of fifteen.
2 ||| Quite faithful until the dumbed-down Americanized ending, yet time and again the treatment is inferior.
1 ||| You'd think that a horror story concerned with the unreliability of sight might at least try to generate scares via the use of visual trickery.
3 ||| Good special effects and some scary characters put together with great cinematography make this one notch up from a B horror film. Turn off those cell phones now, boys and girls.
2 ||| It's hard to know who bears the brunt of the blame for The Eye's stunning dullness.
2 ||| A tediously noisesome English-language remake of an Asian horror picture that wasn't any great shakes to begin with.
2 ||| Alba is so believable as a woman thrown out of her comfort zone... that it's actually a disappointment when the plot kicks in.
1 ||| Seeing isn't believing.
1 ||| stupendously bad
2 ||| Someone else should have seen the obvious hurdle of making a horror movie that relies solely on Jessica Alba's acting abilities.
3 ||| ...turns things upside down for a horror movie - you want to be alone in the dark.
2 ||| The Eye never aspires to be anything more than slick sleepover fodder, but at least that qualifies as a step up for Alba.
2 ||| Not spectacular, not a waste, it's clever enough to keep its momentum going, and smart enough to not overreach its mission of being a diverting 90 minutes or so
2 ||| You're better off avoiding any eye contact with this movie.
2 ||| The fatal flaw with The Eye is that it is a bland and boring work that is the cinematic equivalent of a dead light bulb.
2 ||| Neither a good movie nor a bad movie, The Eye is just ... a movie, sitting there unnecessarily.
1 ||| A poorly acted and instantly forgettable supernatural thriller.
2 ||| The feel-good Japanese horror remake vehicle of the year! No, that's a bad thing.
2 ||| Just be prepared to suspend your disbelief a little more than usual.
1 ||| A film of no distinction of any kind, destined only to fill the late hours at some 10-year-olds' sleepover party.
2 ||| When it comes to finding things in other movies that can be re-purposed, the makers of The Eye have a pretty good eye.
2 ||| An effective if redundant fright flick.
2 ||| When it comes to showing something to end the second-rate horror drought, The Eye is blind.
2 ||| The most frightening aspect of this supernatural horror film -- a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong thriller -- is that there was a 114-minute version, before someone took pity and snipped it down to a lugubrious 97.
2 ||| Further proof that those fueling the Hollywood remake machine are the ones who could really stand to have their vision restored.
2 ||| The movie is watchable -- never more gratuitously so than when Alba is filmed showering and slipping into a tank top. But we've been here before, no?
2 ||| The most vivid aspect of The Eye is its poster image, that of a huge female eye with a human hand gripping the lower lid from the inside. The least vivid aspect is the way Jessica Alba delivers a simple line of expository dialogue.
1 ||| The Eye is the latest Western deconstruction of a successful Asian horror movie and it is louder and more literal than its inspiration.
2 ||| The script is credited to Sebastian Gutierrez, who penned Snakes On a Plane, a movie that knew how to have scares and sex and a bit of fun. What happened?
0 ||| The film's directors, David Moreau and Xavier Palud, bring nothing new to the table, and they aren't even particularly adept at reheating the leftovers.
2 ||| does deserve points for an atmospheric first hour, it's undone by bad acting and a pedestrian ending.
2 ||| I operate under the belief that horror movies should be scary or, at the very least, surprising. The Eye is neither of those, although it is diverting and not without some entertaining moments. I'm on this fence about this one.
2 ||| The Eye contains little worth seeing.
2 ||| Alba's performance is rather limp...
2 ||| The cornea-deprived caper The Eye definitely sports a blurry vision in the meager horror B-movie sweepstakes...never sees clearly in its search for doomsday enlightenment.
2 ||| Um exemplo perfeito da diferença entre um filme que recicla os elementos do gênero terror de maneira criativa e outro que apenas se limita a copiá-los.
2 ||| Seeing is disbelieving.
2 ||| Transforming Asian horror into American horror isn't so bad when the filmmakers respect the source material.
2 ||| it could have been worse
2 ||| The latest American remake of an Eastern import in which the thrills have been hopelessly squandered in translation, replaced with distracting, rapid-fire camerawork and thunderous bumps in the night that reflect a kind of creative desperation.
2 ||| Lionsgate has delivered a solid PG-13 horror film that's both entertaining and suspenseful... and for those of you who don't like it, there will be more SAW on October 24.
2 ||| With every twist of the second-hand plot telegraphed far in advance, you don't need to be clairvoyant to see where this is going.
1 ||| Alba simply isn't good enough to carry this kind of movie, and lacks the presence to counter the major deficiencies of a weak and feeble ghost story.
1 ||| One can't turn a blind eye to such conspicuous failings.
2 ||| There are a couple of effective scares, but this feels like a retread too far. Enough with J-horror already - let's do something new.
2 ||| ...it doesn't leave us with much more than a feeling that we've been there and seen it all before.
3 ||| ...ultimately establishes itself as the most effective endeavor of its kind since 2005's Dark Water.
2 ||| Terrible direction, forgettable performances, and writers who are so faithful to the source material that they even pick up the original film's plot holes...
1 ||| It's all based on the creepy little Chinese film Gin gwai, an atmospheric spine-tingler that, we're sad to say, is considerably more frightening than this tame effort.
2 ||| It creates a good atmosphere, but no tension. The movie is just not memorable.
2 ||| Jessica Alba sees dead people in blah horror film.
2 ||| Turns out seeing dead people can still be kind of a thrill.
1 ||| Brothers Danny and Oxide Pang's unnerving spook show from 2002 has been translated into a clunky, aimless interpretation that leaves you with just one overpowering thought: are Jessica Alba's lips for real?
2 ||| Along with Posey's disappointing turn here, Nivola is uncomfortably weak.
2 ||| No matter how you slice it, this one is just plain dead on arrival.
2 ||| Nowhere near the worst zombie movie I've ever seen, but it will follow in the slew of truly atrocious remakes undeserving of their titles...
3 ||| It's such a fun zombie movie, I'm amazed it didn't get a full theatrical release.
0 ||| The only possible response to the benighted thing is pity.
1 ||| A chaotic mess of violence and gore...
2 ||| It's disturbing to think of the millions of teenage boys who will laugh when he insults a girl to get her in bed, or pees in a cactus plant at a restaurant.
2 ||| My Best Friend's Girl isn't just a misfire; it's a misfire compounded by a chain of miscalculations, and it's hard to figure out who this could appeal to (except, perhaps, Dane Cook's fan club).
2 ||| The movie spends a lot of time trying to be cute, vulgar and cutely vulgar. But it forgets about character, plot and believability.
1 ||| Isolated bits don't add up to much here.
1 ||| Want to spend a seemingly endless 100 minutes watching a dullard trying to decide between a douchebag and a eunuch? Then run, don't walk, to My Best Friend's Girl, a supremely irritating movie about idiots and their dull quest for unconvincing love
0 ||| It attempts to go all warm and fuzzy. It succeeds. But it is the warm and fuzzy stuff that grows on a compost heap after a heavy rain
2 ||| A light smattering of funny moments can't save this misogynistic, feel-bad romantic comedy.
1 ||| A nauseating fraud from start to finish ... The film's level of awfulness is nothing new for Cook, but Hudson hits a new low.
2 ||| My Best Friend's Girl ultimately fails to measure up to its own standards.
1 ||| The inexplicable romantic comedy career of Dane Cook marches on.
1 ||| The movie can't seem to follow its own internal logic.
2 ||| There are no surprises here, but speedy pacing and a smattering of laughs along the way, as well as a knowing turn by Alec Baldwin as Tank's even more piggish father, make My Best Friend's Girl a date not entirely to be skipped.
1 ||| Ultimately, its most unforgivable sin is that it's simply not funny.
2 ||| An ugly, strictly-for-meatheads comedy that can only be recommended to couples who wear matching Tie Domi Toronto Maple Leafs jerseys out on a date.
1 ||| It lacks the courage of its swinish convictions, and abruptly acquiesces to bland rom-com clichs three-quarters of the way to its appointed end.
1 ||| It borrows from much funnier movies such as Hitch, Wedding Crashers and My Best Friend's Wedding. Never has a romantic comedy seemed less romantic or less comedic.
2 ||| Golden Girl Kate Hudson gets tarnished by associating with Dane Cook in this tasteless, terrible movie
1 ||| Raunchy and wretched...profoundly unfunny and sophomoric sludge...meaningless material that wouldn't be suitable for lining your pet parrot's birdcage.
2 ||| It's a movie that ultimately fails because it features characters that are so unlikeable that it's difficult to care whether they form a love connection or not
1 ||| Induces that dull pain at the back of the head that I believe to be the result of brain cells crawling away to die of embarrassment.
1 ||| An insulting, wholly unpleasant excuse for a comedy.
0 ||| Mean, crass and tasteless, "My Best Friend's Girl" is only pretending to be a romantic comedy.
2 ||| [Director Howard] Deutch passes the buck to his three stars...
2 ||| ... this is a verbally poisonous comedy that rattles the sensibility cage.
2 ||| It works much better as a comedy, but by the end, the romantic aspect has taken over and there's not much humor to be found after the first half.
1 ||| A film that truly bites.
3 ||| Dane Cook proves why he is one of American comedy's favourite big-time naughty boys in this fast, funny, foul-tongued but sweet-natured adult-skewed romantic comedy.
2 ||| The film veers off into that realm of unbelievability that I react against. But there is a certain fascination in watching Cook strut his stuff (and boy does he strut), and Kate Hudson is pleasant to watch.
2 ||| If you like watching anarchy in action, this exhibition has its moments, but the anti-woman humour underpinning it -- and Cook's whole performance -- does cast a pall.
1 ||| Any schmuck with a typewriter and a dirty mouth can test the limits of good taste; it's something else entirely to push the boundaries of narrative possibility and emotional empathy.
1 ||| Yet another in a continuing line of dismal Dane Cook so-called romantic comedies.
2 ||| It's a wonder the guys don't just wear Flintstone loincloths. Now let's hear it: Yabba-dabba-don't.
0 ||| This is one of those films that would be enormously improved by the arrival of 100 crazy Somali pirates who would proceed to take the entire cast hostage.
2 ||| Tedious, largely unfunny and poorly written comedy with the least likeable collection of characters you'll see all year.
2 ||| mostly unwatchable
2 ||| ...ultimately falls prey to the melodramatic silliness that one has come to expect from the romantic comedy genre.
1 ||| Inane, raunchy romantic comedy inspires no love.
3 ||| J.T Petty takes viewers on an unusual and frightening venture into the Old West with The Burrowers.
3 ||| Sets you up for 'predictability' in both the western and horror departments, and then subverts those expectations time and again.
2 ||| ...a sporadically entertaining yet thoroughly ineffective misfire.
3 ||| rewarding both as a horror film and a period piece.
2 ||| ... proves once again that the old west still isn't the ideal place to set a monster movie.
3 ||| MEAT TRAIN is the first BOOK OF BLOOD to depart from the station in a long time and it's refreshing to see that the film carries that bleak, yet romantic touch of Clive Barker all over it... it's guaranteed to make you squirm, scream and beg for more!
4 ||| Manages to maintain that sly sense of dread that permeates the best of Barker's horror tales. Certainly one of the most effective horror films of the year.
1 ||| Public-transit terror tale is beyond bloody. Pass.
2 ||| It was a pretty neat concept, but it has such a bad script and bogged down with horrendous acting that I can't say it's a good movie
2 ||| More interesting than most of the torture-porn or Asian-inspired thrillers that make it to theaters these days, but its tired combination of incongruously pretty fashion-mag photography and outrageously gruesome digital effects is dead on arrival.
2 ||| This sharp and brutal little yarn about a photographer who stumbles across a serial killer is a fan film if every there was one -- and only fans will be able to stomach it.
3 ||| Destined to be a cult classic as a vicious, brilliant, and disgusting horror film...
3 ||| Midnight Meat Train can best be described as splatter noir. It's Fritz Lang by way of an abattoir.
2 ||| The film hurtles towards the final 'revelation moment' like runaway train. If only it had stopped to take on board some of Barker's heavy mythical dread.
2 ||| Unfairly buried by its distributors in the US, this film takes what could have been a drab set-up and gives it some real bravado, energy and creativity.
2 ||| The Midnight Meat Train is destined for cult status as an minor horror gem.
2 ||| Japanese director Ryuhei Kitamura, who kicked off his career with 2000's impressive micro-budget zombie flick Versus, delivers plenty of stylish visuals and an admirably unrestrained attitude to gore.
2 ||| while skimpy on characterization and plot, it should please gorehounds and Barker fans alike
2 ||| Goes full speed on ultra-gory rails before slamming to an abrupt stop.
3 ||| This is the best Clive Barker-inspired movie in a long, long time -- probably since "Hellraiser III" in 1992.
3 ||| Midnight Meat Train may be no classic of the genre, but it's certainly a better and more interesting film than most of what passes for horror movies these days.
1 ||| Initially intriguing yet ultimately atrocious...
2 ||| Overall, I recommend the film, you may or may not find it a bit dry.
4 ||| Easily one of 2008's most pleasant, if one dares to call such a film pleasant, surprises.
2 ||| The drama's one glaring weakness is that its contrivances are far too obvious...Despite that, the unexpectedly light, sometimes humorous story is still enormously affecting.
1 ||| Sometimes, however, empty, contrived fantasies are just empty, contrived fantasies, as is certainly the case with this embarrassingly phony cross between Grace Is Gone, Home of the Brave and, believe it or not, Twister.
2 ||| It isn't unpleasant to spend two hours with these three soldiers, although it might have been more enjoyable to spend the time getting to know them rather than force-feeding them artificial road bumps.
2 ||| It's something of a well-intentioned mess.
3 ||| A refreshing departure from the normal 'soldier's story' movies we've seen in recent years.
0 ||| With one head-gnawing plot contrivance after another, it may think it's the wacky Iraq version of Easy Rider but is more like this year's Around the Bend or Diamonds.
1 ||| From start to finish, there is not one single scene on display here that contains even a smidgen of reality.
2 ||| Moments of real trauma are interrupted with sitcom wackiness, all of it connected by a terribly hokey musical score.
2 ||| A road movie with no purpose, and a war drama with no bite.
1 ||| The actual lucky ones will be sitting in a different movie theater, watching anything but this.
2 ||| In the same way much conventional wisdom about the war is half-baked, The Lucky Ones is awash in stereotypes and generalities.
2 ||| Director Neil Burger keeps things light, and the actors are more than engaging. ... But there's something centrally pat and predictable about the coincidence-laden story.
3 ||| If a couple of the plot devices seem contrived, The Lucky Ones makes up for them with sharp, heartfelt performances, and a deceptively easygoing narrative style.
2 ||| A thoughtful study on the way foreign wars can reverberate here at home.
3 ||| This formula is fraught with pitfalls, but the characters and the actors redeem it with a surprising emotional impact.
2 ||| If The Lucky Ones wants to seem like anything more than war vets thrust into a sitcom, it should try going five minutes without a contrivance.
2 ||| The Lucky Ones takes a decent premise -- three soldiers returning from Iraq facing domestic challenges upon their arrival home -- and crams so much forced drama into it that the movie devolves into a hack buddy picture.
2 ||| Based on the evidence here, director/co-writer Neil Burger may be the last American who's ambivalent about the Iraq War, and his movie suffers for it.
3 ||| While their circumstances may be forced, the three characters feel like real, complex, likable people. That's a real rarity in a film about veterans, no matter what the ideology is.
4 ||| There are so many little touches, so many delicate nuances that constantly amaze and inspire, that by the time it was over I almost didn't want their story to come to an end.
2 ||| This is not the worst of the Iraq-themed movies of the past few years, and it's possibly the best acted of any of them. But you wish the bonding of these three people wasn't diluted by the trite scenarios and artificial circumstances of their saga.
2 ||| The dialogue is often sharp and funny and the performances nicely pitched.
2 ||| As they hit the road, the scenes play out like TV sitcom vignettes with little holding the centre together. We find out details about the characters lives, but never feel we know them.
1 ||| Each secret is more implausible than the last.
2 ||| McAdams and Pea are affectingly vulnerable, while Robbins convinces as a family man with strong paternal instincts.
2 ||| The Lucky Ones has plenty of heart and courage. If it only had a brain ...
2 ||| It gets so preoccupied with all the local color and colorful locals, that it forgets about the people on this journey -- or their ultimate destination.
1 ||| Cheap, ignorant, tone-deaf and condescending.
2 ||| Its lack of emotional thrust doesn't inspire the viewer to feel one way or another.
3 ||| Director and co-writer Neil Burger's drama uses the war as a springboard to tell a darkly funny, and sometimes profoundly moving, story of the men and women who are the warriors.
2 ||| It's all merely unbelievable.
2 ||| The chemistry between the three soldiers is strong, but their journey rings hollow.
2 ||| The story (by director Burger and Dirk Wittenborn) contains too many coincidences and convergences to wholly ring true.
3 ||| What gives these episodes cumulative impact is the group portrait that emerges of a well-meaning country in a state of drift.
2 ||| With a smooth, light touch, The Lucky Ones focuses on the idea that the present and the people who factor into it are all we really have.
1 ||| Three Army soldiers on the road in America bond together through a series of preposterous happenings that come across as silly.
3 ||| Of its genre, it's uncommonly good, and it's also the cheeriest movie about Iraq war vets I've yet seen.
2 ||| After running through some pretty contrived paces for much of its running time, The Lucky Ones has some surprises in the last act that ultimately make it more satisfying than it might have been.
2 ||| The biggest disappointment is in this script, written by Dirk Wittenborn and Neil Burger who gave us the delightful Illusionistin 2006.
3 ||| ... reductive and unfunny ... think Coming Home crossed with Vegas Vacation - Cousin Eddie ...
2 ||| ...benefits substantially from the strength and charisma of its three leads...
2 ||| War/road trip dramedy is cliched but affecting.
3 ||| The direction is functional, workmanlike; Burger never steals the spotlight from his characters.
3 ||| Ultimately I was left without any clear notion as to what was being said through the film and why.
2 ||| In this interview, The Lucky Ones director Neil Burger speaks about understanding the modern soldier, his surprising casting choice of anti-war activist Tim Robbins as a veteran and why he relates the story while the Iraq conflict continues.
2 ||| It feels like the writers were trying for dialogue that sounded natural and improvisational. Instead, it feels scripted and rehearsed. It's all phony balony!
2 ||| If not for the warmth and likability of its characters and those playing them, The Lucky Ones would be a tiresome formula picture.
3 ||| Enjoyable, sharply written and frequently hilarious comedy with strong comic performances from its cast. This should strike a chord with slightly overweight men everywhere.
2 ||| An enjoyable if patchy and predictable ride, but Simon Pegg shows he's more than capable of going the distance.
2 ||| Schwimmer often resists an easy laugh in favour of a poignant moment and thereby heightens the sense of urgency during Dennis' last dash for glory.
2 ||| Pegg proves agreeable company in a lightweight Britcom whose biggest laughs emanate from its supporting cast.
2 ||| What should be dreadfully synthetic actually plays as a pleasant time-passer, thanks to a goodly supply of one-liners, and Pegg and Newton's facility for investing a string of hokey plot devices with genuine warmth. Formulaic, yet disarmingly enjoyable.
2 ||| Pegg pitched Shaun of the Dead as "Richard Curtis shot through the head." Run, Fat Boy, Run comes on more like "Richard Curtis kicked in the nuts" - a refreshingly honest Britcom that never really threatens the ribs but which is amiable company throughout
2 ||| ...excessive product-placement has turned the film into one enormous ad for Nike, with all the chilling humourlessness that this implies.
2 ||| ...a mess of sentimental cliches...
2 ||| Seems to lack the aspirations necessary to overcome its failings.
2 ||| Formulaic and thoroughly conventional.
2 ||| It's not hysterically funny, but this British comedy is sharp enough to keep us chuckling right to the predictably sappy conclusion.
3 ||| Schwimmer and Pegg have scored a win--largely due to tasteful choices in the subplotting and providing such a rich ensemble to tickle the shenanigans to a higher level.
3 ||| Pacing and suspension of disbelief aside, I had fun with the heart-felt moments and the sheer comedy. Plus, itâ(TM)s great to see Pegg jump out of his Edgar Wright-zone for a bit and try making a movie with a different group for a change.
2 ||| Credit Pegg for inserting his smart brand of character-driven humor everywhere the script needed him (he polished up an old script by Michael Ian Black), and credit Schwimmer for keeping things moving quickly and efficiently.
3 ||| An unapologetic throwback to the days when comedies didn't have to be all that original -- just as long as they were funny.
2 ||| Using conventional slapstick gags and inventive crosscutting, David Schwimmer scores as a creditable, if not memorable, director...but the innocuous script is totally predictable.
3 ||| This is an amiable film that will provoke some chuckles.
2 ||| Run, Fat Boy, Run stays out of sitcom quicksand long enough to make you think that Schwimmer has a knack for this comedy-directing thing.
4 ||| Well enough crafted to keep you in stitches while on the edge of your seat for the duration, even if this laff-a-minute escape is more mindless than cerebral.
3 ||| Pegg is brilliant, pratfalling his way through heartbreak and indignity
2 ||| This is yet another parody that falls victim to the desire to become what it's intending to satirize.
1 ||| A thin premise undermined by rampant stupidity at every turn.
2 ||| Predictable losers-are-people-too jesting raised a notch by the quality work of consummate professionals.
2 ||| Brit romcom mixes laughs with swearing, smoking.
2 ||| It has meaning and sentiment and a nice pay-off for its finale. But without more laughs, Run Fatboy Run is awfully winded by the time it crosses the finish line.
3 ||| The presence of Simon Pegg and Dylan Moran elevates what might have been merely a pleasant, harmless but ultimately forgettable romantic comedy.
2 ||| Run Fat Boy Run wouldn't make it to the finish line without Simon Pegg's winning performance.
2 ||| It runs out of steam - and you'll likely run out of interest - long before the finish line.
2 ||| Don't get me wrong. The film is seldom boring and I certainly never hated sitting in my seat taking it all in.
2 ||| Outside of a couple of moments of self-conscious shock humor, the most surprising thing about the film is how square it really is.
4 ||| Simon Pegg is almost brilliant with his slapstick comedy and dedication to goofiness.
2 ||| This brand of unfailing comic timing and expressive physicality is rare, and it's why Pegg, in particular, is a star. [Blu-ray]
1 ||| ends up feeling like a boring limerick told over and over again.
2 ||| Fatboy may be more welcome than the latest Matthew McConaughey-Kate Hudson vehicle, but only by a nose.
2 ||| While [Pegg] gets some mileage out of this sketchy material, he's undermined by story and character problems, as well as the limp, uninspired direction of actor-turned-filmmaker David Schwimmer.
2 ||| The project represents an uncertain Britification of a script by Chicago native Michael Ian Black, and the result finds itself stranded somewhere out in the Atlantic, mid-crossing.
2 ||| So pathetically average that you can barely muster the energy to have an opinion about it.
2 ||| Snarkiness and sentiment are in constant battle for supremacy throughout Run Fat Boy Run with no chance of a comfortable draw.
2 ||| [Director] David Schwimmer takes the sow's ear of a script given him by [Simon] Pegg and Michael Ian Black and deep-fries it into a burnt pork rind of a movie.
2 ||| There are so many scenes of him running, it's surprising Pegg didn't just take off and never come back to the set after he saw how things were going.
2 ||| Anyone hoping for the lean meat of the fast, furious, and riotously funny Shaun of the Dead or even the popcorn fancy of the lesser Hot Fuzz will do best to look elsewhere.
3 ||| It may be the kind of film that will make you smile more than laugh, but you'll smile a lot. And although it practically forces you to root for its hero, you won't mind a bit because the hero is played by Simon Pegg.
2 ||| Pegg's Dennis is lazy, insensitive and unhygienic. Yet his most defining quality is blandness. I could barely rouse myself to dislike him.
2 ||| I wish the script credited to Michael Ian Black (The Pleasure of Your Company) and (Simon) Pegg had a little more intrigue along the way to its predictable finish.
2 ||| A hackneyed slacker scenario reduces this film from an entertainment marathon to a plot treading water. The feel-good message comes around, but there is too much packaging for the product.
3 ||| [The movie] may not [provide] an onslaught of gut-busting laughs, but the humor that does come forth is heartier and more authentic.
2 ||| For his debut directing role, Schwimmers steers a safe "PG-13" date movie that roots for the underdog and has a good overall message.
2 ||| It would have been funnier if, instead of Pegg, his frequent collaborator, Nick Frost had taken the role. Then we would have a film worthy of its name. And maybe even a few more genuine guffaws.
2 ||| One thing Schwimmer does do right is keep the story moving swiftly. You're in, you're out, no harm done -- unless you want that hour and a half back.
3 ||| Amiable, consistently amusing and surprisingly affecting, it has the flavor of a Nick Hornby novel, with its focus on an overgrown boy struggling to grow up and be a man.
2 ||| Run, Fat Boy, Run is the directorial debut of actor David Schwimmer, who is much better behind the camera than in front of it. Here, he's taken material best suited to sketch comedy and turned it into a feature of no small heart and humour.
2 ||| Run Fatboy Run is largely content to follow the formula, guide us on a sunny tour of downtown London's tourist hot spots and transform Pegg from paunchy schlub to Runderella with a few decent laughs along the way.
2 ||| Tere's nothing edgy or new about Run, Fat Boy, Run.
3 ||| This is a romantic comedy light on romance but heavy on comedy, and it's well cast to skew in that direction.
2 ||| Enough already. I mean, I don't have anything against comedies about dopey guys who win the love of a good woman by competing in ridiculous Olympian contests. But if I wanted to see a really funny one, I'd rent a Rocky movie.
3 ||| The kind of movie that's apt to be dismissed a goofy lark. It is that. But it's also a rare comedy that believes in its own message, and that could inspire the depressed and the demoralized to grit their teeth and keep running.
2 ||| Thanks to a jaunty Brit-rock score and likable characters all around, the movie's easy to watch and occasionally pumps up the emotions.
2 ||| There's much too much of everything in Run, Fatboy, Run. Every ounce of comedy is so forced and full-on ridiculous that when characters express even a smidgen of sentiment, it feels like a parody.
2 ||| Pleasant but unfocused, a romantic farce, trying very hard to be sweet when it needs to be a bit more cheeky.
2 ||| The material isn't any more inspired than the protagonist is inspiring. Run, Fat Boy, Run should have been whipped into better shape before the starting gun sounded.
2 ||| While this movie lacks the screaming energy and consistency of Shaun of the Dead and his hysterical Hot Fuzz, Pegg is able to keep things interesting.
2 ||| A movie that is smartly written, boasts plenty of funny lines and rides hard on Pegg's ability to look and act like the most stoically put-upon person on the planet.
3 ||| This is not a film with blazingly original ideas or a groundbreaking script - I guessed the ending before the movie even started - but it has a sweet nature, an abundance of laughs and plenty of Pegg to spare.
2 ||| From storyline to characterization to style of comedy, everything about the directorial debut of former Friends star David Schwimmer is a nod to accommodation, compromise and consensus.
2 ||| Run, Fatboy, Run isn't going to win any prizes for fresh questions. But it's just fleet enough to hold its own in the middle of the pack.
1 ||| Run Fat Boy Run might as well have been written by a rushed piece of software. The program calls for a surprise engagement, a street fight complete with crotch punches, an apartment eviction, and a runaway child -- all in about five minutes.
2 ||| For all its faults however, this is a romantic comedy that works - if just barely.
2 ||| Amiable. Bland. Cute. Formulaic. Inconsequential. Run Fatboy Run goes down with ease, but it's awfully slight.
3 ||| Seldom laugh-out-loud funny and the script doesn't have the witty insight of Pegg's last few films, but Pegg's bumbling charm is just enough to make this movie run.
3 ||| It's clear in the scene where they try to scam the marathon officials that Dylan Moran would be a good candidate to play the grown Harry Potter in the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows film. Somebody take note!
3 ||| Simon Pegg is a wonderful physical comedian. And he's able to take off with his talent in "Run Fatboy Run," a comedy that's not up to par of his other starring roles but one that nonetheless provides quite a few laughs.
3 ||| While some moments rely solely on Pegg's natural on-screen goofiness, he & M. I. Black have simply written a very funny script that spreads the fun evenly throughout.
2 ||| When all is said and done, you're better off renting the Friends Season Four finale...That was brilliant. This is like a bad Farrelly Brothers movie.
3 ||| Overcomes its occasional stumbles, thanks almost entirely to the charm of its cast...
2 ||| A fine work of craftspeople both in front of the camera and behind...whose chief mistake is that every one of them appears to have forgotten that it was in fact a comedy.
3 ||| Neither original nor packed with surprises. It is, however, entertaining and thoroughly likable.
2 ||| Simon Pegg gives it the old college try, but his character isn't worthy our cheers. Maybe Pegg should resurrect his most famous character, the resourceful, much funnier Shaun, and do battle with the zombies of London rather than the marathon runners of Lo
2 ||| ...a bit rude and uncouth, but sweetly affecting...
3 ||| Warm/funny film about a man trying to re-win his true love by running a race
3 ||| It is neither as funny nor as wickedly subversive as 'Shaun of the Dead,' but it respects its characters enough to make them thoughtful and surprisingly complex, unlike the sitcom stereotypes inhabiting lesser romantic comedies.
2 ||| It's a lazy effort that offers little encouragement for the future of Schwimmer's directorial career.
2 ||| Run Fatboy Run n'offre rien pour révolutionner le genre, mais présente assez de bonnes intentions pour justifier son existence, et nous faire passer un bon moment
2 ||| Run, Fatboy, Run winds up being as immature and exhausting as its protagonist.
1 ||| Em sua estréia na direção, Schwimmer atira para todos os lados: comédia física, escatologia, estereótipos, besteirol, e por aí afora, falhando consistentemente todas as vezes. E Pegg jamais esteve tão artificial, o que é uma surpresa desagradável.
2 ||| Turn and run, no matter what size you are.
2 ||| (Run, Fat Boy, Run) is your nice, fun, romantic film that is not necessarily worth spending your money to see in theatres.
2 ||| Schwimmer offers generic rom-com conventions in his feature directorial debut.
3 ||| It's a good formalic romantic comedy. Nothing more.
3 ||| It's a Generation X movie in a way very few movies are any more; it is unseemly to admit that our generation is about as slackery as we had promised to become. Go with your ex and smile.
2 ||| Schwimmer completely lacks what it takes to ever get this movie off the ground. The story is fairly formula and the actors are basically on mark, yet the jokes (most of which are so predictable they are telegraphed a mile in advance) land with a virtually
2 ||| ...cuter and sweeter than I expected, a mildly pleasant surprise.
3 ||| The picture manages to juggle both the silly and the sentimental without falling flat.
2 ||| Far from the gut-busting brilliance of Pegg's other, self-made starring vehicles.
2 ||| About as funny as Ross on "Friends." David Schwimmer (Ross on "Friends") directs.
2 ||| An enjoyable, even heartwarming little movie that embraces its clichés and never lets them get in the way
3 ||| Amid the laughs, the one thing Closing Escrow proves is this: It's a lot more fun watching other people trying to buy or sell a house than going through it yourself, particularly if Realtors like the ones here are involved.
2 ||| While far from the cream of the mockumentary crop, it's still a pleasant diversion.
2 ||| The film would have worked better if it had stuck more closely to real estate as both the source and target of the satire.
3 ||| If you can watch it without weeping over your own predicament, you'll see some serious talent bursting out.
1 ||| Closing Escrow is one of those self-aware mockumentaries of the sort Christopher Guest likes to make -- only it's not that funny.
3 ||| No matter how ridiculous the characters come off, they're more than just punch lines. In fact, despite their quirks, [they're] improbably endearing.
2 ||| A spoof, sometimes a funny one, and sometimes just plain overkill.
3 ||| Escrow isn't as polished or consistent as the best of its sub-genre -- but it's pretty dang funny for the most part.
1 ||| The funniest Antarctic thriller of 2009!!!
1 ||| Perhaps it would have been better if I'd blacked out for most of Whiteout.
1 ||| .Little more than an extended episode of "C.S.I. Antarctica," "Whiteout" is a film that couldn't be more boring and uninteresting if it tried and if there is one thing that it most certainly doesn't do, it is try.
2 ||| When serious moments are accompanied again and again by collective widespread laughter from an otherwise well-behaved audience, it is a tell-tale sign that something has gone very wrong in translation from page to screen.
2 ||| We do wish you the best in your future endeavors and that you do manage to find a warmer climate.
1 ||| ...feels like one of those movies that never progressed much beyond the concept stage - yet ended up getting released anyway.
2 ||| Beckinsale gives a standout performance as the smart and tough female protagonist. You root for her to prevail over the bad guys.
2 ||| It's a wonder Whiteout isn't in 3D, what with its initial onslaught of in-your-face flying propellers, crashing planes, and a lingering close-up of Kate Beckinsale stripping to her skivvies.
2 ||| The screenplay by Jon and Erich Hoeber and Chad and Carey Hayes (too many cooks?) is confusing and leaps huge gaps in logic.
2 ||| Sadly, Whiteout wimps out, starting out like The Thing and winding up like CSI: South Pole, wasting whatever it has going for it.
1 ||| One must assume that Rucka's original [graphic novel] is better than this, but only because most things are.
2 ||| The mystery is not mysterious, the action is not exciting, and the suspense is more like boredom.
2 ||| It'll take all day to list all the things that are wrong with Whiteout.
2 ||| If you want the real Whiteout experience, just read the book. Or ask the manager of your local 7-Eleven if you can play Clue in the beer cooler.
3 ||| All we're given is a lukewarm mystery where frustrating plot holes give way to lackulster conclusions, and even the most furious CGI snowstorms can't obscure the film's telegraphed "twist."
1 ||| Dull and draining, Whiteout should have been offered under one of these preferable alternate titles -- Washout, or even better, Wornout.
1 ||| The only thing to care about is what lotion Beckinsale uses to make her skin hold up so well in sub-zero temps.
2 ||| An adequate thriller - complete with scares, red herrings and a nonsensical twist-ending %u2013 which exploits its Antarctic surroundings for all their worth.
2 ||| The mystery grows thick while the ice on which the story elements struggle to survive melts away.
2 ||| It has a great cast, an original thriller setting, and a compelling concept, and yet the central mystery is surprisingly limp.
2 ||| But the screenplay is a massive jumble of nonsensical moments and ideas, while director Dominic Sena mishandles things so thoroughly finding the bits where things run smoothly is like finding a needle in a gigantic mountain of powdery snow.
2 ||| A lifeless whodunit, it wastes the mystical setting and the always game Kate Beckinsale on a pedestrian plot that could be set anywhere.
2 ||| A tolerably entertaining film starring the weather.
2 ||| ...an easy enough way to pass time if you're not too demanding or if the cast or unusual setting piques your interest.
1 ||| It's as bad as "I Know What You Did Last Summer", except on ICE!
1 ||| Ice-schlocky - an idiotic wipeout.
2 ||| For all its frozen blood, assaults with ice axes and killer weather, Whiteout turns out to be only a pale imitation of the thriller it might have been.
0 ||| The severely nonthrilling thriller Whiteout moves like winter in Antarctica. Who the flake greenlit this blobby blur?
2 ||| While the setting can be mesmerizing, little else about this movie is captivating. It's a standard-issue thriller, with a twist you see coming a continent away.
1 ||| No event occurs without a character telling us what we're seeing. This unwelcome commentary is so overdone that it becomes, by the end, an invitation for audience participation. All together now: It's a body! Looks like it's been shot in the head!
2 ||| Whiteout conditions don't translate well to the action genre, either. Unless you don't mind watching unidentifiable snow-suited folks grapple in -50C conditions with an also-unidentifiable icepick-wielding murderer as CG ice violently pelts down on them.
1 ||| The film is all panicky zooms and badly staged action dotted with random forensic gross-outs. And, just for the fun of it, an amputation scene.
2 ||| Depicts how a woman U.S. marshal at a frigid station in Antarctica is tested on many levels by a murder case.
2 ||| A ham-handed murder mystery.
0 ||| Those worried this means Beckinsale will be wearing parkas and snowsuits the entire time will be pleased they still figure a way to showcase her in her underwear within the first 5 minutes
2 ||| Has a perfunctory, by-the-numbers approach to its story and its characters.
1 ||| We get an irritated Nancy Drew with a flashlight, stomping about in mukluks through a plot with as much clarity as an ice storm at midnight.
1 ||| ...the whole cast delivers numb, almost affect-less performances; the cold must have got to them.
2 ||| Even in a whiteout, you can see the plot twists coming.
2 ||| A predictable whodunnit set in a cinematographer's paradise.
1 ||| John Frizzel's over-worked soundtrack keeps telling us how exciting everything is, but it feels as if we're frozen in time. Not so much a white-out as wipe-out.
0 ||| A frozen hellhole.
2 ||| At least 10% more exciting than correction fluid.
1 ||| There's wonderful potential for permanently bleached out vistas to embody a metaphorical emptiness. Here it's just a great big blank.
2 ||| A whodunnit set on a scientific research base in Antarctica that slowly becomes a "Who cares?"
2 ||| Despite Beckinsale's impeccable features appearing to be rendered in porcelain, her performance is far from lifeless...she does the best with the material. It's just a shame the same can't be said for the film-makers.
1 ||| The sub-standard work from everyone involved means that Whiteout is very much a missed opportunity that undoubtedly would have been better left on the comic book page.
1 ||| Devoid of personality and full of characters so one-dimensional that they aren't even worth mentioning in this review, Whiteout is a movie that sees no-one emerge with any credit.
2 ||| By eliminating so many suspects before the obligatory drawing-room denouement and final deadly confrontation, it's a given that the audience will feel cheated when the real bad guy turns out to be the only possible contender.
2 ||| With plotholes you could drive a snowplough through and as eventful as an Antarctic winter, Whiteout is less a whodunit than a getonwithit.
1 ||| Hobbled by a ruinously slow start, an utter lack of excitement and a twist ending that everyone will see coming, we're left with one of the year's worst.
2 ||| The first sight the audience gets of the Brit star is her stripping to her undies, pointing her perfectly-shaped rear to the camera then stepping into the shower. It's one of Whiteout's three highlights.
2 ||| Apart from a lascivious shot of his scantily clad star, director Dominic Sena keeps the action fairly swift under blizzard-like conditions: at times we seem to be watching people fight inside a snow globe.
2 ||| The story could be involving but it's clumsily told, veering between simplistic and confusing.
2 ||| Whiteout has a good premise and a likeable lead, but it goes rapidly downhill and is ultimately disappointing.
2 ||| This generic snowbound thriller desperately wants to remind you of Insomnia, but it's not worth losing much sleep over.
1 ||| Lacks sufficient thrills, chills and intrigue as it grows into an increasingly ludicrous and inane mess, even if you're willing to suspend your disbelief for 101 minutes.
1 ||| Characters flail their way through the snow and we squint to see what's going on only to discover that what's going on is pretty much nothing.
1 ||| The characters based on the [graphic] novel never get beyond one dimension and the film moves at the pace of an Antarctic glacier. On second thought, the glacier moves faster.
2 ||| Setting Whiteout in Antarctica salvages the movie from the cinematic scrap heap.
2 ||| What a stiff.
1 ||| You'd think that a movie that opens with a gratuitous Kate Beckinsale shower scene couldn't be all bad. But you'd be wrong.
2 ||| Whiteout is not awful, but it is maddeningly mediocre.
2 ||| I'd watch Kate Beckinsale in anything but even she can't make this movie anything better than average.
2 ||| Starting from a graphic novel, Sena has turned out your standard TV crime show bloated with a monstrous FX budget.
1 ||| It takes slightly longer than three minutes for diminished mental capacity to set in during this Antarctic murder mystery with a fatally low body temperature. Kate Beckinsale is unrepentantly lazy, dialogue is awful and its misdirection is obvious.
2 ||| The misleading trailer suggests 'Nancy Drew vs. the Thing,' but this graphic-novel adaptation is more 'CSI: Antractica' -- a straight if occasionally gruesome murder mystery, boosted by the novelty of its sub-zero South Pole setting.
2 ||| a relatively mediocre, by-the-numbers mystery thriller that melts from your mind as soon as you step into the sunlight
1 ||| I wasn't entertained, I just wanted out of the supposed cold.
1 ||| Whiteout is a colorless wasteland. There's only one thing that could have helped cover this film up: A flashback that changed the script's name to Wite-Out.
2 ||| ...it's painless. Brainless, too, but not so much so that you want to throw a shoe at the screen.
2 ||| South Pole-set whodunnit is bloody but bland.
0 ||| If you'd forgotten that this title ever existed, well, so have I.
2 ||| Dominic Sena, whose credits include 1993's 'Kalifornia' (good) and 1996's 'Swordfish' (not so good), can't seem to find anything new under the perpetually obscured sun.
3 ||| Whiteout isn't particularly bad but it does follow the thriller playbook step-by-step with only a little tweaking. A lack of originality isn't the end of the world but it could have been so much better.
2 ||| When the snow starts blowing, it's impossible to tell who's who and what's what. Maybe parkas should be color-coded.
2 ||| It's a shame to see Beckinsale reduced to this, with the camera leering over her body as she showers in a sleazily transparent (and altogether useless) exploitation of her sexuality.
1 ||| Whiteout looks stunning but underneath that icy sheen it's an utter damp squib of a film.
1 ||| Beckinsale tries to make something happen here.
3 ||| Slow-cooked to perfection
3 ||| The influences of a strange outside world rub up against -- and sometimes abrade -- Southern tradition and a good ol' boy's increasingly fragile sense of self in this dry, gentle, sometimes silly and sometimes very funny comedy.
4 ||| ...the sort of movie that, if the dice fall right, could find a considerable audience. It is a lot smarter and truer to life than a lot of little independent movies that could and did.
1 ||| It's just that the comedy and the drama never quite crystalize into anything remotely affecting, with the end result feeling more like some extended Southern in-joke than an honest movie.
2 ||| Arch in a way that his previous feature was honest, it's a clumsy attempt to lay an overcoat of forced cornpone whimsy on a drab storyline involving mobsters.
2 ||| Not a very good movie, on the whole, but there are laugh-out-loud moments and there's promise in the unusual world it depicts.
2 ||| The blarney isn't the only thing that's thick in writer-director Brad Gann's Black Irish.
2 ||| Writer-director-producer Brad Gann's tale of growing up in blue-collar South Boston features a strong central performance, but it doesn't miss a cliche of hardscrabble adolescence.
2 ||| The difficulties of coming-of-age in an Irish-American family with a violent older brother and a self-destructive father.
2 ||| A drismal drama rather reminiscent of Angela's Ashes, especially in terms of maintaining a relentlessly pessimistic and morose tone.
2 ||| It'll be worth watching to see if [director Brad Gann] plays to his strengths on future projects.
2 ||| Black Irish boasts many memorable scenes and fine characterizations but ultimately plays more like a series of snapshots come to life than as an organically satisfying story.
2 ||| A small-bore Southie coming-of-age drama whose heart is just a bit bigger than its cliches.
2 ||| The movie falls apart when it tries to explain why Poppy's been sent to this school. And the Spartacus moment at her school "trial" for misconduct is so cringe-worthy you want to die.
3 ||| Bright and silly, with just enough wit and intelligence to make it watchable, this British-American teen comedy doesn't break much new ground, but is pretty entertaining while it lasts.
2 ||| Despite a shaky start, Wild Child is actually a surprisingly entertaining teen flick, thanks to likeable performances and a script that highlights the importance of friendship. Worth seeing.
2 ||| It may be manna for teen girls but any kind of critical eye will find it about as convincingly made as the last St Trinian's movie. It is played, though, with lively abandon.
2 ||| Alex Pettyfer is even more wooden than he was in Stormbreaker - for heaven's sake, he's not even that good-looking. And the story's utter tosh.
1 ||| On balance, gouging one's eyeballs with a chopstick would be more fun than watching this crummy tween comedy about a Californian princess.
2 ||| WILD? More like mild, unless you think short skirts and "horse face" put-downs are outrageous.
2 ||| Shame on Iggy Pop for letting them (ab)use his anarchy-anthem 'Real Wild Child' in a girls'-own flick that is so paltry it makes the recent St Trinians addition look like Picnic At Hanging Rock.
2 ||| Unless you're fourteen and female, look away now. There's absolutely nothing for you here.
2 ||| All amiable enough, but still a bit tame compared to, say, Clueless, or Lindsay Lohan's Freaky Friday remake.
2 ||| It's Mean Girls meets Malory Towers and as such it's strictly for a tween girl audience.
1 ||| The sort of film that real too-cool-for-school teens wouldn't be seen dead watching, Wild Child is aimed at those younger than its protagonists. Loud and obnoxious, like its lead character, it deserves to be expelled.
1 ||| This celebration of mid-Atlantic compromise is one for the youngest and most forgiving of teenage girls.
2 ||| Clumsy direction means most jokes fall flatter than the paper-thin plot.
2 ||| The screenplay by Lucy Dahl (daughter of Roald) dwells unpleasantly on cruelty and humiliation, and finally Poppy does little more than exchange one form of snobbery for another.
2 ||| It's an unoriginal story but one with potential, and the actors who play Poppy's school chums are lively company.
2 ||| Mildly entertaining and utterly innocuous...
2 ||| Holding up well, cute -- "peak" Emma Roberts.
1 ||| Few will remember Powder Blue as a desperate copy job of Paul Thomas Anderson's brilliant Magnolia but rather as the film where Jessica Biel finally took it all off.
2 ||| It's not likely [Biel] is comfortable with her nude scenes (which are neither lengthy nor discreet) being used as a selling point, but Bui fails to provide much else worth discussing.
1 ||| an embarrassing display of directorial exploitation and a waste of acting goodwill.
2 ||| A serendipitous erotic thriller reminiscent of Crash in the way that lots of Angelenos' lives intersect serendipitously, except that here the characters have a seedy strip club in common instead of car accidents.
3 ||| An entertaining look at the flagship of American empty calories, King Corn is a few bushels short of being the next Super-Size Me, but brings a legitimate message.
3 ||| Well, it's certainly one of the less blatantly compelling subjects on the non-fiction circuit, and the doc has a lower-octane approach than most, but King Corn is surprisingly absorbing and amusing viewing.
3 ||| King Corn insists that we recognize the Corn Belt's beauty and intelligence along with its somewhat self-induced plight.
3 ||| King Corn is entertaining enough, but it's also a moral, crucially skeptical road trip down the food chain.
3 ||| King Corn becomes an indispensable supplement to Spurlock's Super Size Me.
3 ||| While there's no startling news here -- most people know that high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a staple in food processing and isn't particularly good for us -- this documentary neatly, and often humorously, summarizes a very unhealthy situation.
4 ||| entertaining and even a little mischievous, it finds perverse outcomes, but no villains. It is informative, without creating partisanship, respectful without being patronizing, entertaining without being dumbed-down
4 ||| A breezy diary from a pair of first-time farmers, as well as a wry rebuke to a nation devoted to eating cheaply but not necessarily well, King Corn makes its points without much finger-wagging.
4 ||| Engaging and illuminating.
3 ||| Simultaneously nostalgic and sinister, King Corn mixes full-blown Americana with fast-food follies in the Iowa heartland.
2 ||| There is an interesting story here. It's just that the movie doesn't tell it very well.
3 ||| Someone pass the Fritos!
2 ||| Scarcely an expos, Terror's Advocate is more plainly a portrait of a man as a timeline.
3 ||| This fascinating documentary is sort of like a radical left-wing "Where's Waldo?"
4 ||| Jacques Vergs had defended a lot of people, and it's his Zelig-like journey through the politics of the postwar 20th century that is the contentious subject of Barbet Schroeder's unwieldy, unforgettable film.
3 ||| That [director] Schroeder doesn't offer simple explanations gives his tale honesty and fascination.
2 ||| Despite extensive interview footage with Vergs himself, Terror's Advocate fails to crack its enigmatic subject matter.
3 ||| A brilliantly shrewd and maddeningly elusive figure, controversial lawyer Jacques Vergs alternately fascinates and repulses in Barbet Schroeder's gripping documentary.
2 ||| Talk about a hard sell.
4 ||| Jacques Vergs is such a compelling, complex and contradictory character that if he didn't exist someone would be obliged to invent him. It is the gift of Terror's Advocate to simply present Vergs as is.
4 ||| Packed with courtroom drama, mystery and international intrigue.
3 ||| Terror's Advocate is one of the most engaging, morally unsettling political thrillers in quite some time, with the extra advantage of being true.
2 ||| It's a movie that cries out for a good editor.
3 ||| Jacques Vergs makes for compelling documentary film fodder: He is arrogant, cosmopolitan, politically unpredictable and enmeshed in the roots of modern international terrorism.
3 ||| Schroeder's film, which combines interviews with many of the key figures in Vergs' career with grainy historical footage, lets its subject speak for itself but leaves little doubt of where the filmmaker stands.
4 ||| For just a moment, ignore politics. Consider Jacques Vergs simply as star. The radical French lawyer is an absolutely compelling figure onscreen: exotic, resolute, beguilingly smug.
3 ||| The movie functions crackingly well as a non-fiction international thriller.
3 ||| Barbet Schroeder's astonishing documentary is a glimpse into another world, and not one you would necessarily want to visit for too long.
4 ||| The lawyer's intense isolation, his solitary, perverse rage against the world, against France, against conventional opinion, is felt most deeply.
2 ||| If you want to see a who's who in terror, just take a peek at this guy's client list.
2 ||| Schroeder's approach to this controversial figure is more plodding than it should be.
3 ||| Ainda que falhe em decifrar seu complexo protagonista, o documentrio estabelece um intrigante retrato de um homem cujos princpios morais e ideolgicos eventualmente se tornam to flexveis quanto o espectro alcanado por sua clientela.
3 ||| Terror's Advocate is a history lesson in modern insurgency and terrorism paranoia without ever being lecturing at any point. The conceited Vergès is always entertaining and clearly loves his own notoriety in this engrossing film.
2 ||| Its 99 minutes could have easily been about 65 if you removed all of the celebrity do-gooder filler.
2 ||| Frankly, there's a way to get a message across and this sort of talking heads doc by numbers isn't it.
3 ||| In a way that news reports so often fail to do, Darfur Now puts a deeply human face on a global crisis.
2 ||| For all the good intentions on show here, Darfur Now is not much of a film.
2 ||| Will more than support the feelings of those already involved and make others think twice before walking past volunteers asking for a minute of their time.
4 ||| 'Inspiring' is a word often used to describe human-rights-oriented documentaries, but Theodore Braun's film about efforts to ease the ongoing genocide in Sudan's Darfur region really earns that epithet.
2 ||| Darfur Now is a worthy if inconsistent attempt at collaring a concerned audience and saying, You, too, can make a difference.
3 ||| The best material is the result of the rare opportunity to shoot inside those refugee camps: hearing firsthand testimony from victims about the catastrophic horrors inflicted on their villages is forceful and persuasive.
2 ||| Much of the film plays like a static lecture, and a repetitive one as well.
4 ||| Hopefully, well-crafted and moving films such as Darfur Now will inspire more people to take that small but significant first step toward ending these atrocities.
2 ||| Almost conclusively portrays the Darfur problem as no longer a problem. But even if so, Darfur Now is not really a film about the Darfur problem, anyway.
3 ||| A quiet, methodical call to action.
2 ||| The documentary Darfur Now proves that -- no matter how important the subject matter -- following various people around with a camera doesn't necessarily make a film.
4 ||| This is the kind of film that doesn't end after the credits roll, and it's a gold-star example for what a documentary should do: inspire.
3 ||| By showing the struggles and efforts of about half a dozen people, it puts a human face on the tragedy.
2 ||| In movie making, as in life, it's not enough to mean well. The real challenge is in being meaningful.
4 ||| Both important and engrossing, devastating yet inspiring.
3 ||| At 99 minutes, the documentary presents a quick but thorough lesson.
2 ||| In the end, Darfur Now is a movie whose hopeful message is undermined by its seemingly hopeless reality.
2 ||| A documentary exploring the roots and reason of African political corruptness and its history of a tribal violence that shows no signs of abating might have done more to raise real outrage.
2 ||| An inspiring documentary about six very different courageous and creative activists who are doing what they can to help the suffering people of Darfur.
3 ||| If it accomplishes nothing else, Darfur Now locates Sudan on the map -- More than that, the film provides faces for the people of Darfur.
2 ||| Darfur Now is effective pamphleteering, but only an occasionally compelling documentary film.
2 ||| Though well-intentioned, Braun's documentary never captures the emotional heart of this enormous tragedy and fails to ignite the passion he so obviously wants us to feel.
3 ||| Darfur Now does one thing other documentaries on the region in western Sudan haven't done so far: It offers hope that something substantive may be done about the Darfur genocide.
3 ||| Admirable work.
3 ||| A rallying call to aid Darfur and an uplifting case study in the power of individuals to effect change.
2 ||| This is a feel-good film for activists, which barely scratches the surface.
2 ||| A disquieting, and somewhat disjointed, call to arms.
3 ||| Informative and effortlessly gripping.
3 ||| Slick, impassioned, and guardedly upbeat.
3 ||| The title says Darfur Now -- not Darfur Then, not Darfur Sometime. But the question it asks emphatically is, Darfur Now What?
2 ||| Braun is, in a sense, preaching to the choir...
2 ||| A powerful testimony to the changes that may come when people make an effort to let their voices be heard.
2 ||| While it's commendable that Cheadle and Clooney travel the world to promote awareness of the Darfur conflict, it doesn't necessarily make for a good 10 minutes of film.
2 ||| One can't help but sense an edgier, braver film fighting to break free.
1 ||| With Bunty Aur Babli, Yashraj had stuck a chord with small town India. I doubt if they would be able to repeat it with Lagaa.
2 ||| No amount of clunky train metaphors can cover up the movie's routine dramatic trajectory.
2 ||| As lovely as some of the footage looks and as committed as are the three lead performances, they serve only to make Rails & Ties play like an exceptionally well-acted and well-made Lifetime movie.
2 ||| Scripts [don't] come any sudsier than Micky Levy's awesomely bathetic Rails & Ties.
2 ||| It's closer to a small kind of affecting and simply human story we rarely get to see in mainstream movies anymore.
2 ||| While it features three strong performance and the debut of a promising filmmaker, the story line is obvious and rather melodramatic.
1 ||| Alison Eastwood makes her directing debut with this ludicrous melodrama, in which a troubled couple and a newly orphaned boy heal each others' emotional wounds against a backdrop of blunt metaphors.
2 ||| [Director Alison] Eastwood has the advantage of two very fine actors, Kevin Bacon and Marcia Gay Harden, who have the ability to lift the most mediocre of material into another realm.
2 ||| A movie that should have had some more work done to it, and could have been better if it had, arrives with all its flaws carefully preserved.
1 ||| The only conceivable reason for Warner Bros. to (barely) release this mush is as a favor to Clint Eastwood, whose daughter Alison directed.
3 ||| A modest but emotionally affecting drama.
2 ||| Rails & Ties essentially remains a TV movie weepie, but it's a high-end one.
2 ||| An hour and a half of emotional overload that you can either buy into and feel depressed, or reject and feel cheated.
2 ||| Fortunately for first-time director Alison Eastwood, Rails & Ties is populated by three sensitive actors who tread carefully through Micky Levy's anachronistic script.
3 ||| Heartfelt, compelling family drama, particularly for an adult, female audience.
2 ||| Rails & Ties is so self-consciously unadorned that it feels as if its director didn't want us to think that she was trying to make a cinematic statement. She hasn't.
2 ||| ...ultimately redeemed by Kevin Bacon's expectedly engrossing performance.
2 ||| It's not all bad.
2 ||| The younger Eastwood tells her story with sledgehammer blows.
2 ||| Either an unsuccessfully manipulative, sappy melodrama or the most deranged concept for a family sitcom anyone has ever developed.
2 ||| All the astute acting in the world can't bring such a preposterous story into the station on time and intact.
1 ||| One highly unlikely circumstance after another become laughable, preventing you from being moved by the family tragedies depicted. They beg for tears, but a script this chock-full of holes is unlikely to elicit the desired effect.
2 ||| I think somehow the filmmakers lost the way, lost sight of the people inside the plot.
2 ||| Alison Eastwood has created a film of quiet delicacy, something fragile yet resolute, and shot through with a life affirming thread that is brave enough to suggest that sometimes life does indeed blossom from tragedy.
2 ||| DVD is the perfect place for a movie like Rails & Ties. Somehow it's easier to block out the often forced nature of the plot and just enjoy the rich performances and the humane themes.
2 ||| Marc Levin may avoid outright idol-worship, but any restraint exhibited by his film is disingenuous.
3 ||| Marc Levin's biggest coup was actually finding Barnes and having him tell his story in his own words, which is ultimately the most interesting part of the movie
3 ||| Nonjudgmental without being morally dense, the film makes human sense out of an inhuman example of addiction capitalism, '70s style.
2 ||| Marc Levin, whose last documentary, Protocols of Zion, was a gutsy examination of post-9/11 anti-Semitism, has an even tougher job on his hands with Leroy 'Nicky' Barnes: making the man interesting.
2 ||| Isn't an inside look at the men who ruled a city but just an excuse to collect 'Superfly,' 'Sexual Healing' and 'Let's Stay Together' on a soundtrack.
3 ||| What emerges is a portrait of a complex man.
2 ||| Levin was clearly captivated by the sheer spectacle of Barnes' career.
3 ||| It's not a pretty picture, but it sure is a compelling one.
3 ||| Mr. Untouchable is never dull.
2 ||| Less a dispassionate examination than a celebratory infomercial on its central character.
3 ||| [Director] Levin skillfully mixes the Barnes interviews with news clippings, 1970s street scenes and the recollections of Mr. Untouchable's former associates.
2 ||| A lackluster documentary that lionizes this creep while ignoring the damage that his distribution of drugs did to society and the many brutal murders he ordered.
3 ||| Does the movie glorify Barnes and his nefarious profession? Probably, but show me a movie about the drug trade that doesn't hook us first with guts and glamour before the moralizing fall.
2 ||| Like much of the story of Harlem in the '70s, the truth is the least important part.
1 ||| The only spiritual enlightenment I achieved was thinking "Thank God that's over" when the closing credits began to roll.
1 ||| Completing Roadside Attractions' HOUSE was physically draining, which is something a viewer should never have to endure when in theaters. The adaptation of the novel by Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker is preachy, whiney and painfully cliché.
2 ||| The film doesn't achieve the horror or creep factor it could have%u2014or that the trailer seems to promise%u2014mainly because of strange stylistic choices.
1 ||| To say that mush-minded incompetence runs wild here would be to insult mush-minded incompetence everywhere.
2 ||| I walked into the movie expecting to give it one star, or lower. Instead, it was just mediocre.
2 ||| Like most movies where belief makes up a good percentage of the narrative rationale and resolution, House has a very hard time with its dogma.
1 ||| The cluttered, unconvincing dialogue -- not to mention Moseley's ongoing penchant for crazed overacting -- make it more of a genre curiousity than anything the Fangoria gang would likely want to sit through.
1 ||| Christian-themed horror film too intense for kids.
2 ||| Overall, the pacing and characters are where House suffers. The film works as a direct-to-DVD horror movie, but it definitely has its rocky moments.
2 ||| Writer-director Joseph Greco's refusal to explain the roots of Mary's madness gives John's desperate desire to summon happier days a bewitching poignancy.
2 ||| Despite its admirable qualities, Canvas fizzles and falls into cliche.
2 ||| An absence of detail means that Canvas teaches little about what it's like to be mentally ill or to know someone who is.
2 ||| Greco succeeds where many others have failed in giving a real sense of what it is to grow up with a parent who's hobbled by mental illness.
3 ||| Greco takes his biggest risk, perhaps, when he puts that boat in water with father and son manning the sails. It could be a mawkish scene that sinks everything that came before it, but like the watercraft that symbolizes so much, the movie remains afloat.
3 ||| I can see why it was a hit at film festivals. I only hope it now gets its due in theaters.
3 ||| First-time filmmaker Joseph Greco draws on personal experience for this devastating yet honest portrait of an ordinary Florida family.
2 ||| Though Harden has the showier role, a subdued Pantoliano is the movie's real star. Sometimes, the quietest performances are the most powerful.
3 ||| Canvas is a serious film about mental illness and a sentimental heartwarmer, and succeeds in both ways.
3 ||| Canvas is a movie that rings emotionally true, despite structural contrivances and dim, washed-out color.
2 ||| Canvas is worth seeing for the acting, but the disease-of-the-week conventions and hackneyed visuals pretty well knock the wind out of its sails.
2 ||| Canvas just doesn't sketch a sufficiently vivid portrait.
2 ||| It's like a public service announcement with dialogue.
4 ||| Movies don't come more personal than Canvas, writer/director/co-producer Joseph Greco's serious-minded exploration of the devastating effects unleashed by mental illness upon an otherwise tightly knit American family.
2 ||| Though Canvas may not deviate much from the formula followed by so many other movies about families imperiled by health crises, it's unusually perceptive about the ways that loved ones process (or fail to process) the resulting stress.
2 ||| There is something to be said for a filmmaker like Greco who takes the truth -- no matter how tough it is -- and turns it into a compelling drama about people we might know in life.
3 ||| It's worth hanging on for where Greco goes with this.
2 ||| ...Skid Row too often comes to feel like a vanity project, with the focus of the film frequently shifting away from Skid Row's history and people to Pras's sketchy immersion in homelessness...
3 ||| An eye-opening and necessary look at a large, plain-view problem that most people would simply rather ignore.
4 ||| Pras, one of the founding members of the hip-hop group The Fugees, goes undercover to shed light on the plight of the homeless.
2 ||| When the most intriguing thing about a film is the production design, you know you're in trouble.
2 ||| The songs are undistinguished, and while newcomers Sonam Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor (who aren't related) both have impeccable Bollywood pedigrees, her performance is wildly uneven -- and his strenuously madcap antics are grating rather than endearing.
1 ||| How can it be that a movie as beautiful to look at as Saawariya is so...boring?
2 ||| A breezy and passably entertaining major Indian musical, the first to be released by a major Hollywood studio.
3 ||| Saawariya is 2 hours 11 minutes of wide-screen close-ups, fanciful sets, colorful costumes, bellybuttons, almost-kisses and 10 pumped-up, achingly sweet songs.
3 ||| May not be the artistic milestone many have been hoping for, but as the first product of Bollywood's marriage with Hollywood, there should be pride from all corners for producing a solidly crafted entertainment.
2 ||| Disappointingly, neither India's most artistic director nor his new discoveries can prevent this song-packed extravaganza from being a beautifully crafted bore.
3 ||| Aaja is genteel and winsome and directed with restraint. Some of the best dialogue in recent times, resting on a core of quietude.
3 ||| Cleverly written and brilliantly made ... the type of classy and tasteful British crime-drama that Caine has long been associated with.
3 ||| As far as what the filmmakers constructed, the spirit of the title term is close enough to forgive blemishes that don't really spoil the fun.
3 ||| a classy, smart, and fiendishly sly piece of filmmaking that keeps the audience on the edge of its seat
2 ||| It may not be as insensitive as Blood Diamond's inane examination of the diamond industry and its accompanying slave trade, but Flawless's utilization of the issue as a mere diversionary plot point is nonetheless plenty distasteful.
1 ||| A mediocre heist film with a preposterous finale.
3 ||| It's good disposable entertainment that offers the right mix of character identification, plot unpredictability, and suspense to keep viewers interested throughout.
4 ||| Revealing when it needs to be and unpredictable when you least expect it.
4 ||| As complex a mindbending crime caper as you could hope to wrap your head around.
2 ||| The film is slight, sure, but it is also a lot of fun, and no amount of misplaced moralistic sermonizing at the end can steal those well-earned good vibes away from me.
3 ||| It is kind of a shame that it isn't getting a wider distribution because it is precisely the kind of intelligent adult entertainment that people are always complaining isn't being made anymore.
2 ||| a flat, boring film where director Michael Radford fails to find the rhythm, danger and excitement of a caper movie.
4 ||| The filmmaking and acting are so good it tingled my spine.
2 ||| For all its stodginess, however, Flawless is a reasonably good time, for one reason. The reason's name is Maurice Micklewhite, better known as Michael Caine.
2 ||| For the most part Radford turns in a hushed, marble-polished heist film with a genuine sense of tension and mystery
2 ||| Priority numero uno in a heist movie should be making the robbery giddily dangerous, but Flawless has all the sizzle of a bank teller on Monday morning.
2 ||| How can an actress with Moore's carnal screen presence be so underused by carnally minded Hollywood?
2 ||| For a movie about a diamond heist, Michael Radford's talky, 1960s-set Flawless lacks sparkle--despite strong period detail, earnest messages, and committed performances.
3 ||| A weak plot still makes a viable vehicle for a couple of great performances with some unbeatable screen chemistry and a good old fashioned plot twist at the end.
2 ||| Polished but oddly lifeless heist thriller.
2 ||| Caine alone is worth the price of admission.
2 ||| Those of us who'll happily watch Caine in pretty much anything will find enough pleasures here.
2 ||| This is supposed to be a caper movie. Shouldn't it have a heroine who looks as if she could, you know, conceivably, caper?
2 ||| The plot contortions that very slowly unfold under Michael Radford's arthritic direction in Flawless are not much...entertaining.
3 ||| There is a nice sense of style, and appreciation for tense face-to-face confrontations among characters trying to ignore the temptations around them. It's sort of the opposite of the current robbery flick The Bank Job - all substance and no flash.
2 ||| Though the central mystery does hold one's interest, tin-eared dialogue, unlikely staging and dramatic conveniences all work against our being swept up in the chicanery.
3 ||| Flawless is a gimcrack, a genre exercise, yet it's a confidence game in the best sense of the phrase. [Director] Radford knows the rules - when to bend them, when to break them, and when to play by them. That's an increasingly rare skill.
3 ||| Flawless, directed with a fine eye by Michael Radford, is a diamond-heist thriller that will make you nostalgic for the smart, classy caper films of a certain era.
3 ||| Flawless is a fictional tale, but something in director Michael Radford's conscientious, methodical presentation gives it the feeling of true history. Watching it is like watching a historical dramatization of something that never really happened.
2 ||| Despite a finale that fails to live up to the promise of its premise, Flawless still manages to be a polished throwback to the great British crime thrillers of the '60s, and a welcome return to form for director Michael Radford.
2 ||| Flawless is a mildly diverting period heist movie in which an odd couple conspire to loot an evil London diamond company, for which they both work.
3 ||| An enthralling bauble of many facets: part feminist thriller, part "howdunnit" mystery, and all good old-fashioned story.
2 ||| Michael Caine's performance in Flawless is just that. As for his co-star, Demi Moore ...
3 ||| This is an old-fashioned escapade that respects everyone's intelligence and allows you to cheer for the underdog. Moore actually plays an age-appropriate character who handles the heavy burden that represents women at the time with depth and aplomb.
2 ||| Where are the truth in titular advertising police when you need them?
2 ||| The inspired pairing of Demi Moore and Michael Caine as a pair of thieves in the diamond-heist semi-caper movie Flawless goes a long way toward overcoming the film's slack, leisurely pacing.
3 ||| This is a first rate caper piece elevated by Caine's effortlessly elegant portrayal.
2 ||| Retro London heist caper may not interest kids.
3 ||| If not worth its weight in gold (or diamonds), at least worth the price of a movie ticket.
3 ||| Flawless isn't impossibly joyless, but it's a lot less fun than it ought to be...
2 ||| Like the diamonds that motivate its characters, Flawless" has a pretty surface but not much else.
3 ||| It's a work of brilliant cut, color and clarity that delivers on almost all of its ambitious promises.
3 ||| There are better heist films, but none of them are showing at your local movie theater this month
2 ||| It seems irresponsible, if not downright stupid, for the makers of any movie to call their feature Flawless. But the most current film to sport that risky title has a number of serious storytelling flaws.
2 ||| The answers to its most intriguing puzzles disappoint, and the final motive provided for this near-perfect scheme can only be described as flawed.
4 ||| May not quite live up to the daunting implication of its title, but as a solid piece of beautifully acted and precisely written filmmaking, you'll find nothing better.
2 ||| I think if the script had some tweaking, this could have been a great heist film. Instead, it's just another mediocre one.
2 ||| For about 100 of its 108 minutes, this film treats the viewer to a stylish, suspenseful roller coaster peppered with all manner of ugly, money-grubbing corporate types.
3 ||| What a cast - Michael Caine, Demi Moore, Joss Ackland. Yet here it is, released at the fag end of the year just in case anyone notices. It makes you despair.
2 ||| There's little by way of thrills. Still, as a caper with a great cast and clever premise, Flawless works, despite its, um, flaws.
1 ||| The problem is that as heist movies go this is about as captivating as watching someone dodge a bus fare. Almost everything about the film is second-rate: the direction, the plotting, the intrusive modernist production design.
2 ||| Ignore the dull framing device and this is a watchable period crime drama. Pity about the dull, oft-used title though.
2 ||| Fatuous and soulless.
2 ||| You will need a very sweet tooth for this kind of thing, and, to be quite frank, the heist itself is not dramatised all that excitingly or clearly. But I quite like thrillers featuring enormous circular vault doors.
2 ||| "Hang on lads, I've got a great idea..." said Michael Caine at the end of The Italian Job. Presumably he didn't mean waiting 40 years before pulling off a caper that wouldn't blow the bloody doors off a rabbit hutch.
2 ||| Diamonds aren't forever in this sluggish heist caper from Michael Radford that partners Michael Caine and Demi Moore for the first time since 1984's Blame It On Rio.
1 ||| They don't make thrillers like this any more, and for good reason.
2 ||| Like many Christmases, the whole thing leaves you stressed, exasperated and longing to leave for home.
2 ||| If ever a film title begged to be abused, this is it.
2 ||| If only the plot was as sleek.
2 ||| A creaky, below-par Brit heist caper that belongs in a dusty vault itself.
2 ||| Yet for all the imperfections, Flawless is a film you find yourself rooting for. Heists involving a keen sense of history are pleasant to stumble across.
2 ||| Enjoyable heist thriller with strong performances from Moore and Caine, though the ending is slightly disappointing.
3 ||| Terrific performances elevate this extremely low-key heist thriller into something thoroughly intriguing. It may never crank up much excitement, but the 1960s vibe it generates is very cool.
2 ||| While Diaz and Kutcher work through their stock repertoire of winsomeness, the second bananas steal the show.
2 ||| Raunchy romantic comedy has a softer side, too.
2 ||| This breezy confection should work well corralling it's target demo to come up triple 7s for Fox if the marketplace can handle yet another rom com.
2 ||| Sadly, about the nicest thing I can say about What Happens in Vegas is that I didn't hate it -- although I suppose that's something.
2 ||| Like Mr. and Mrs. Smith without the action or The Break-Up with less depth--if that's even possible...
0 ||| A distinctly awful cover version of 'I Want A New Drug' plays on the soundtrack and is a direct thought to the audience who is going to need something a lot stronger to make it through this unrelentless excuse for a romantic comedy.
2 ||| The good news is that the movie itself is nowhere near as disastrous as that trailer made it appear. The bad news is that the darn thing still isn't all that great.
2 ||| As tepid romantic comedies go, they forgot to pack the fun. This one should have stayed in Vegas.
1 ||| The battle for the human heart has official morphed from witty, sophisticated banter between star-crossed lovers to something akin to mixed martial arts.
2 ||| 'What Happens in Vegas' has a similar structure to 'Knocked Up,' only it has neither the unplanned pregnancy, nor the laughs.
2 ||| So moronic it almost makes the recent mediocre Made of Honor seem sophisticated by comparison.
1 ||| Despite the presence of some likable, funny people, it's a painfully unfunny romantic comedy that makes you dislike those same people intensely.
2 ||| The film gives a transparent spin to the saying that whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but Diaz and Kutcher bring a surprising sweetness to their generic roles and the story's contrived situations.
1 ||| What Happens in Vegas, one of those junky time-wasters that routinely pop up in movie theaters, won't make you laugh much or at all.
2 ||| The overall sour tone and worn-out feel of the movie overwhelm any positive aspects.
2 ||| So many things, small and large, erode any sense of fun here. The movie looks like crud -- like it, too, stayed up and drank all night.
2 ||| Though a notch above Made of Honor on the tolerability scale, Vegas takes a shot at love with all the romantic know-how of Tila Tequila.
1 ||| You can take what happens in Vegas, keep it in Vegas, and keep the rest of the us out of it.
2 ||| What Happens in Vegas . . . should have stayed in Vegas. Or in New York, where most of this predictable, uninspired film takes place. Or in Hollywood, where such lamebrained ideas are hatched.
2 ||| While watching insipid romantic comedies, I often cling to the comic supporting characters as my life preserver.
2 ||| With a script that only barely hangs together by the skin of its teeth, this romantic comedy survives on the considerable charm of its terrific cast.
2 ||| The plot is both feeble and ridiculous, but this still delivers more than its fair share of laughs, thanks to terrific comic performances from Kutcher, Diaz and supporting players Rob Corddry and Lake Bell.
3 ||| With likeable actors like Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz who aren't afraid to go over the top for comedy, What Happens in Vegas turned into a pretty good film.
1 ||| Scream, scream, scream. When did writers get the idea that what audiences find really funny in comedies is screaming? A full-out assault on your senses, the film isn't just bad. It's painful.
2 ||| What Happens in Vegas contains enough unbridled silliness to salvage its lowbrow high concept.
2 ||| What Happens in Vegas refuses to take a gamble. Like a bleary-eyed gambler repeatedly tossing a pair of dice, it tiredly goes through the motions.
2 ||| When a movie depends on supporting characters to tell the audience just how good the romantic leads are together, you know you're in trouble deep.
3 ||| Here's a romantic comedy that is goofy, highly implausible, sometimes over the top, often in bad taste, and resolutely empty-headed. In short, it's the best example of its genre to appear on the screen this year.
1 ||| What happens in Vegas is nobody has much fun.
2 ||| We all know what happens in Vegas -- and we know, without having to watch it, what happens in this movie.
1 ||| Considering that the title of the movie was conceived by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, it's not a huge surprise that What Happens in Vegas is stocked with product placement.
2 ||| Directed by Tom Vaughan and written by Dana Fox, who also wrote the excruciating The Wedding Date, this film often seems improvised, and not in a good way. Some setups go nowhere, and some jokes never get set up at all.
2 ||| Screenwriter Dana Fox (the dreadful Wedding Date was hers) and director Tom Vaughan can't find much fun or romance in this. What Happens in Vegas ... offers none of the surprises that screen comedy so desperately needs.
2 ||| It's called What Happens in Vegas, but it should have been called What Happens in Hollywood as it pretty much defines contrived studio comedy.
2 ||| For an idea of the level of wit, several gags are built around the name 'Dick Banger'.
2 ||| While Diaz and Kutcher make their clichéd characters as likable as possible, you can bet on this: Any movie named after an already-stale ad campaign isn't likely to gamble on the unexpected.
2 ||| What Happens in Vegas is about as bubbly as flat champagne. While aiming for an intoxicating blend of high-energy comedy, the romantic comedy's predictable story, and the lack of chemistry between stars Diaz and Kutcher, don't leave it withmuch of a kick.
2 ||| The latest uptight chick/slacker dude romantic comedy is so formulaic, you could win big if you placed bets on what's going to happen next.
2 ||| What Happens in Vegas feels oddly stilted yet desperate, as though its principals felt the need to overcompensate for the too-neat symmetry of opening scenes with over-the-top violence and bright orange tans.
2 ||| It's a testament to how good casting can help a film and bad writing can hurt it even more.
2 ||| None of this is anything we haven't seen countless times before in rom-com land, of course, and it would be giving the filmmakers way too much credit to say they have entertainingly tweaked a winning but cob-webbed formula.
3 ||| The outcome of What Happens In Vegas is obvious, but the journey there is fun.
1 ||| Who knew the title wasn't simply clever (inviting the rejoiner 'stays in Vegas') but a dire warning of a bad movie ahead?
2 ||| Though likely not a film you'll remember a month after seeing it, it does hit most of the right notes for a good date flick.
1 ||| When it was over I felt vaguely embarrassed. I wasn't just leaving a movie theater. I was taking a walk of shame.
2 ||| The supporting players save What Happens in Vegas from rom-com infamy.
2 ||| ...one can't help but wonder if there's anything of interest left to say within this increasingly stale genre.
2 ||| I like to learn something every day. In this case I discovered a harsh truth. You can have slapstick without the comedy.
2 ||| What Happens in Vegas is a clever concept lamely executed.
2 ||| What Happens in Vegas . . . boasts the not inconsiderable appeal of good-looking people having a good time -- even while having a bad time.
2 ||| What Happens in Vegas should damn well have stayed in Vegas. Instead, the thing has leaked out as a movie that, one grey morning this week, swiped 100 minutes from my life.
2 ||| Bland enough to make millions as culture edges closer to oblivion.
1 ||| Amid the bright lights, Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher fail to generate even the faintest of erotic sparks.
1 ||| not a complete lost cause, but no one tries to emerge from the icky goo known as mediocrity
1 ||| The end result is easily the worst romantic comedy that you will find in theaters this weekend (or possibly this year) and yes, I am fully aware that "Made of Honor" is still playing.
1 ||| Are you laughing yet? Are you moved by these incredible insights? Are you, most likely, looking for the exits?
1 ||| I just don't know what to make of a scene in which a judge sentences two selfish jerks to "six months hard ... marriage," but I'm simply too old and too smart for material this insipid.
2 ||| Wants to be liked so badly it's afraid to do anything that might actually make you respect it in the morning. In that sense, it works. It's a 99-minute PG-13 airplane movie good for a few chuckles and another notch on Rob Corddry's widening comedy belt.
2 ||| Kutcher and Diaz both make good with what they have, but they deserve better.
2 ||| Kutcher has talent and potential. It has been his misfortune to attach his star to people who aren't up to the quality of his talent. He has time to correct this, but the clock is ticking.
3 ||| I can't recommend it as a must-see date night getaway, neither will I discourage audiences looking for a little bit of mindless rom-com fun. And given the likable nature of the film's two stars, this trip to "Vegas" coasts by on just enough charm to make
2 ||| The colorful second bananas' bawdy badinage turns out to be a lot funnier than that of the co-stars who have little more to offer than their looks and sexual chemistry going for them.
3 ||| Two fresh stars elevate the material into solid entertainment
1 ||| What Happens in Vegas is a sorrow attempt at a romantic comedy. So let the saying stand What happens in Vegas, should stay in Vegas.
2 ||| Ultimately, What Happens in Vegas resembles a drunken night in Sin City; when it's over, you don't really remember what happened except that it wasn't good.
2 ||| Hardly a massive gamble, Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher play a safe romcom hand you can tolerate.
1 ||| What happens in this seriously flawed would-be romantic comedy is Nothing Much.
2 ||| It's less obnoxious than Fool's Gold, less forced than Made of Honor and less formulaic (well, by a sliver, anyway) than 27 Dresses.
2 ||| Pleasantly forgettable.
2 ||| It's a sure bet you'll realize "What Happens in Vegas" is a by-the-numbers romantice comedy within the first 15 minutes.
1 ||| Like many Vegas weddings, this mean-spirited "romantic comedy" only makes sense if you're drunk.
2 ||| ena Tzak Pot sta klise poy paradoksos leitoyrgei anapanteha apotelesmatika, kyrios hari stin yperballoysa karikatoyristiki apeikonisi ton haraktiron poy se stigmes ftanei to anegkefala ksekardistiko kai sti himeia toy zeygoys ton ermineyton
2 ||| ...one of those bird-brained contrivances that would be over in no time if any of the characters had a lick of sense...
2 ||| (Vegas) isn't a horrible film but it is not worth spending your money on to see in theatres.
2 ||| attempts nothing novel in its retelling of the couple who don't realize that they are perfect for each other, aside from positing an unsavory new popcorn topping
2 ||| Both Kutcher and Diaz are in full-on desperation mode, straining in each scene to prove they can still be relevant, showing flashes of the charm that made them famous in the first place.
1 ||| During the screening, I tried to come up with as many synonyms for the word "excruciating" as I could.
0 ||| Should have stayed, not in Vegas, but elsewhere in the state of Nevada. How about those mountains where they are supposed to store the radioactive waste?
1 ||| From seeing this movie and talking to several moviegoers, I discovered that there are two kinds of people: people who like Ashton Kutcher, and people who don't.
2 ||| I only wish they'd have spent more time drunk and in Vegas in the whole movie. Alas...
2 ||| The combined verve Diaz and Kutcher bring to the table saves a routine time-killer from being entirely forgettable.
2 ||| Another predictable romantic comedy, one that insists that spending time locked into an unhappy marriage doesn't breed contempt, but sows love. [Blu-ray]
2 ||| What Happens in Vegas has mediocre direction and a strained screenplay, so how can it be any good? What carries the film is its two stars. If Ashton Kutcher bothers you, you'll probably hate What Happens in Vegas. If Cameron Diaz leaves you
3 ||| a funny movie about the sexes that doesn't diminish either gender in its execution--a tougher task, obviously, than one would presume.
2 ||| Standard-format rom-com, with a mismatched Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz doing the quick-to-bicker, slow-to-bond thing.
2 ||| What happens in Vegas? The same stuff you've seen in every B-grade romantic comedy for the last 50 years.
3 ||| It is the romance that sets Appaloosa apart.
2 ||| When you're lookin for an Olde Time, pistol-wieldin', rootin', tootin' varmint, hire somebody other than Jeremy Irons. What is this--Bonanza Revisited?
2 ||| While he thankfully avoids the actor-filmmaker avenger fantasies of The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, Harris doesn't have the genre chops to fill Appaloosa's empty spaces.
3 ||| The bullets may not be comparable to the Yuma remake or Kevin Costner's underrated Open Range, but the men holding the guns are still the same. So what if they're just a little bit different?
2 ||| too authentic to be populist, yet too familiar to transcend the genre and hang with the bona fide classics.
4 ||| Appaloosa is gripping entertainment that keeps springing surprises.
3 ||| A satisfying journey that doesn't require too much examination, just an appreciation of the scenery and what it took to get by during this period of American history.
2 ||| If you're someone who orders the usual and is just happy when it comes out warm and fresh, I reckon Appaloosa will sit with you just fine.
3 ||| Appaloosa satisfies all its requirements but never breaks a sweat.
2 ||| Appaloosa has a solid enough opening, and it should be fun just to watch things play out, what with the shootouts, the trains, the swagger at gunpoint. But the script (co-written by Harris) is alternately dumb and lifeless.
2 ||| Appaloosa will probably just ride off into the sunset without much of an impact, but it will sate your fix for horses, guns and slapping leather. You know, if you're into that sort of thing.
2 ||| It's a pleasure to watch such gifted actors interact in a classic genre.
1 ||| It's both dull and preposterous, which neither Dean Semler's somberly handsome score nor Jeff Beals' pushy, cornball score does anything to ameliorate.
4 ||| Harris follows his strong helming debut Pollock with a contribution to the western movie revival that looks and sounds like a classic.
3 ||| Ed Harris has the kind of head that would look great on a coin, but it looks even better on a movie screen, as he turns his chiseled features this way and that.
3 ||| Beautifully photographed by Dean Semler, Appaloosa is the best Western since Open Range and shows there's still life in this most unfashionable of genres.
2 ||| Though the leads do fine work, their efforts often feel slightly futile.
2 ||| It's unfortunate for everyone concerned, and for the film, that the train chugs into town one day.
2 ||| Throughout, the repartee between Harris and Mortensen never feels less than broken-in and believable.
2 ||| Luscious enough photography and fun to watch, "Appaloosa" brings nothing new to the table. As a collection of things that have been done before who will watch it over the originals?
3 ||| Appaloosa shows a square jaw and a steely gaze, but also a smile and a wink.
2 ||| The top-heavy plot takes over, and the picture makes a beeline back to tepid convention.
3 ||| A smart and funny script, highly entertaining from the first draw, Appaloosa is a taut, captivating tale of the old West with enough bite and modern edge to draw in both fans and non-devotees of the cowboy genre.
3 ||| Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen have mastered the art of subtle communication, amplifying the believability of their relationship in this ruggedly male bonding tale.
2 ||| Harris and Mortensen are out to get Irons, and their plan appears to be to talk him to death. It took a lot of stretching to get this to last for two hours.
2 ||| Where the film lets you down is in the boundaries of the dramatic map which needs a more dynamic (and cinematic) driving force.
2 ||| Appaloosa is entertaining, certainly, but it feels rather slight and feeble next to some of its more superior recent cohorts in the western genre.
3 ||| While there's nothing particularly original about the plot, the characters and the way they interact with each other are strikingly played
3 ||| Enjoyable, frequently offbeat western with an intriguing script and terrific performances from Harris and Mortensen.
3 ||| This, though, is not so much a comedy as a western with the ironic undertones that someone like Hawks would appreciate while telling a story such as Rio Bravo.
3 ||| Too much romance makes the movie sag near the end and the plot could have gone in a more interesting direction. But if you are wild about Westerns, saddle up for Appaloosa.
4 ||| In all, it's a magnificent ride and certainly one of the finest films of the year.
2 ||| If a western is going to be this slow, it needs to have a lot more tension, and deeper meaning, than this one.
2 ||| A classics-steeped western that rams home tradition over reinvention, Appaloosa kicks it hard as a buddy pic on horseback. Harris and Mortensen's study in laid-back companionship is the principal pleasure, leaving Zellweger mired in role that does her and
3 ||| As comfortable as an old saddle and as sharp as an Apache arrow, this a Western for the modern era.
2 ||| Photographed handsomely with wide-angled majesty, the film does precious little myth-making, though Harris subtly twists some of the genre's conventions.
3 ||| This is no revisionist western designed to shock life into an unfashionable genre, rather a film that respects the conventions of the traditional western.
2 ||| A western that moseys along in amiable style, largely thanks to the chemistry between Harris and Mortensen.
2 ||| These are horse-opera fundamentals; having given them short shrift, the film just shuffles down its lonesome trail into the horizon and out of your memory.
2 ||| These days, westerns are a dying breed, uncommonly found in multiplexes. Appaloosa is the latest reason why.
3 ||| Ed Harris, working from a Robert Parker novel, has crafted a meticulously detailed, newfangled old-fashioned morality tale of hard men who go soft when a woman comes between them.
3 ||| This is an honest tale of the camaraderie between a pair of lawmen simply trying to do a job.
3 ||| Actor turned filmmaker Ed Harris wants to go back to the days of simple sagebrush storytelling, and with one major exception, everything he does...is nothing short of brilliant.
3 ||| Harris proves that there is still some life yet in a genre that has essentially been left for dead for nearly four decades at this point.
3 ||| "Appaloosa" doesnt re-invent the Western, and thank goodness for that.
4 ||| ...one heck of a western, one that will join the ranks of "Unforgiven" and "3:10 to Yuma" as modern classics.
2 ||| There is plenty of plot but not enough story. And the film unfolds in short scenes strung together that beg to be expanded into more detailed examinations of behavior.
3 ||| [Harris's] performance as the usually quiet but quick-to-action gunman is terrific, and he's smart enough to leave much of the narration duties and such to the soft-spoken Mortensen.
3 ||| Appaloosa is an archetypal western with touches of the modern buddy comedy. Though it falls short of these classics, it is a little bit Destry Rides Again and a little bit more Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
3 ||| What is seductive about Appaloosa is its easygoing rhythm.
3 ||| Ambition is a great quality in a filmmaker, especially when it's realized. Yet there is something to be said for just telling a story, and with Appaloosa, Harris does a fine job of it.
3 ||| With Wayne's gruff arrogance, Eastwood's squinting revenge eyes and Stewart's ambling cool, Harris carves a daunting figure.
2 ||| Appaloosa is firmly grounded in genre orthodoxy even as it teases at the edges of nonconformity. The results are decidedly mixed.
4 ||| It's deliberately paced, but this non-Western-fan loved it.
3 ||| Harris displays a quiet, unshowy confidence and a genuine fondness for the genre, capturing the horses and guns and saloon glasses in a soft, almost-sundown light.
4 ||| Harris co-wrote, directed and stars in the film, which is filled with humor, action and clever turns.
3 ||| Appaloosa carries a whiff of feminism. Or at least an awareness of what life was like for women on the frontier.
3 ||| There's a refreshing vein of understated humor running throughout the production. It's neither forced nor unnatural and it keeps things from becoming too somber, even when the bullets start flying.
2 ||| It lacks the substantial story that would make it memorable.
3 ||| From its first, mournful brass theme, Ed Harris's Appaloosa nails the look and feel of a classic Western. This is an old-style, laconically macho, six-shooting horse opera made with an obvious and unapologetic love of the genre.
3 ||| Harris directs with a steady hand and sharp eye for the best in his fellow actors.
2 ||| Mortensen should certainly do another western, soon. Preferably he should do one with a real sense of danger to go along with all the neat, tidy, highfalutin' honor and decency.
3 ||| A warmly made, slightly offbeat movie about friendly devotion. It also happens to be a western, and every man in it is grizzled or wizened or both.
4 ||| The movie brings back the danger and the humane humor of strong, silent men of action.
2 ||| A suitable slow burn punctuated by sudden acts of violence; it fairly oozes off the screen like bloodied molasses, and then, heated, bubbles up and over, all smoke and fire and endless clouds of New Mexico dust.
3 ||| 'Appaloosa' might be described as a routine Western, except that in the moviegoing culture of 2008, there's nothing routine about the pleasures of a well-made and entertaining Western.
3 ||| ...a classy entry that's as much about the moral choices facing the characters as the horses and six guns.
2 ||| Standard western finds comfort in its familiarity.
3 ||| ... a classical Western that invites us to savor no-nonsense camaraderie between two shootists for hire.
3 ||| Quiet, contemplative and with an astonishing climax that spins the film on its head and gives it meaning and nuance I almost didn't see coming, this is a story of male friendship that's both stirring and powerful.
1 ||| With a cast and director like this, you would expect greatness. What you really should expect is a cup of coffee so you can stay awake.
2 ||| I love a good western, so I am not very enamored with Appaloosa. I guess you can say I just want to be friends with it.
2 ||| Hardly a fresh perspective on genre traditions, it's still got the performances and glorious landscapes to win you over.
2 ||| Clearly not worried about modern action conventions, Harris' movie is a traditional Western in every sense of the word, and it seems weird to call it 'new' at all.
3 ||| Harris' easy byplay with Mortensen, his economical dialogue and his stately camerawork of the New Mexico landscape combine for a smart, dynamic Western.
4 ||| If it feels a bit like an old Howard Hawks western (no slacker with the subtext himself) -- that's not a bad thing.
3 ||| Plays on conventions so smoothly that we're never distracted from the ride.
2 ||| ...so old-fashioned it even carries a troubling dose of old-fashioned sexism.
2 ||| Zellweger's Allison zaps Virgil of his almost superhuman qualities and the film eventually becomes ordinary when the love of a woman interferes with the law.
4 ||| It's a rousing, efficient western that is about the friendship of two men, just as much as it is about getting the bad guys.
3 ||| Harris and Mortensen radiate a rugged integrity...
3 ||| Appaloosa takes the traditional notion of a lone lawman fighting injustice and turns it successfully on its head.
2 ||| Sometimes Appaloosa seems bent on exploiting the standard cliches of the western genre ...while at others it seems striving to be a modernist update full of ambiguity ...
4 ||| For those of you who yearn for Westerns like "3:10 to Yuma" and "Tombstone," here's another one you should reach for.
4 ||| A welcome return to the roots of the western genre.
2 ||| The film is more trenchant character study than thrilling showdown, and it confounds as many generic expectations as it fulfills.
2 ||| Viggo Mortensen's brilliantly cool performance engenders enough good will to see "Appaloosa" through its pokey meandering to an intriguingly philosophical conclusion: a look at modern outsourcing, capitalism and progress through a Western prism.
2 ||| A fine cast produces a surprisingly low-key outing. It sports a plot like a Western from 45 years ago, but pacing familiar from LONESOME DOVE.
1 ||| Ed Harris' howler of a vanity piece.
3 ||| A better than average western in the Clint Eastwood tradition
3 ||| A western bromance.
2 ||| Uma produção correta e que prende a atenção especialmente graças à dinâmica entre Harris e Mortensen, mas que, no fim das contas, não exibe nada que a torne diferente do convencional.
3 ||| ...provides enough variety to keep the heart, mind, and adrenaline on alert.
3 ||| Nothing new or groundbreaking here, just a lot of talented people coming together for a well-made and entertaining Western.
2 ||| I give thanks for westerns. Every time they seem to be about to gasp their last, dusty breath, one comes along to give them a bit of renewed life. Bless it, the western genre will not die. Last year it was the excellent remake 3:10 to Yuma. This ye
3 ||| Harris has made himself a reputation as a mark of quality...Like Pollack, Appaloosa has the best of both worlds, with Harris both in front of and behind the camera. [Blu-ray]
2 ||| Brush away the dust and you'll find a sense of nostalgia and romanticism about lost American values and altered social hierarchies.
3 ||| True, the film is a little long, and it loses momentum at one stage, but generally speaking this is a most enjoyable return to what was once the cinema's most popular genre.
3 ||| There's considerable pleasure in Appaloosa's respect for the undramatic. It doesn't go where you'd expect...
3 ||| A dusty, old-fashioned Western with a dusty, old-fashioned vibe. You can all but smell the saddle soap as the story unfolds.
2 ||| old-fashioned but simple and effective entertainment
3 ||| Old-fashioned Western features great performances.
2 ||| A droll Western with an odd romantic triangle.
4 ||| The requisite standoffs and shootouts make this one tense film, but the mood is frequently lightened with a generous dose of surprising humor.
3 ||| The film neatly blends short, brutal violence with a surprisingly traditional visual take on the classic western.
2 ||| The story is just not strong enough to carry the entire movie.
3 ||| It's more Harris's attention to dialogue, character and the film's overall production design that makes the film so memorable.
2 ||| For Amorim, who only claims his second feature with Good, it's best to see the film as a next step towards honing the quality storytelling skills needed for making successful movies.
2 ||| One's ability to wholeheartedly embrace the story is consistently hampered by the distinct atmosphere of staginess and artificiality...
2 ||| Good feels more self-important than satisfying.
2 ||| Mortensen evidently thought that a stuttering and maddeningly tentative delivery renders the man, as written, understandable, or creditable, or sympathetically good.
2 ||| A character study of a Nazi quisling that's frequently too muddled to reach even the level of banality.
1 ||| Despite its rather highbrow pedigree, Good's journey along its predetermined path from book burnings to concentration camps reeks of middlebrow button-pushing, which the cast's clipped British accents do nothing to dispel.
1 ||| An ambitious move about a Nazi professor played by Viggo Mortensen that never really grabs hold of us because it's difficult to identify with the main character.
3 ||| Good is pretty schematic — betraying its theatrical roots, perhaps. It's also a little drawn out. But it demonstrates the surprising power of character flaws in drama.
2 ||| Though the film opens with an intriguing burnished look, it bogs down about halfway through with talkiness and uneven pacing. When reality finally dawns on Halder, it is not only too late for him to redeem himself, but too late for the audience to care.
2 ||| To those who wonder if we really need Hollywood to give us more Holocaust stories, I would argue yes, just better ones than we get with Good.
1 ||| Good is an anemic screen adaptation of C. P. Taylor's play about a respectable 'good German' who passively acquiesces to Hitler's agenda.
2 ||| There are some striking locations and certainly the era continues to fascinate audiences (and, particularly this year, filmmakers). Too bad, then, that this is such a disappointment -- awkwardly directed and flatly scripted.
2 ||| We know just what each character will do, and exactly where each path will lead. And we're never wrong.
2 ||| The banality of evil has met its match in the banality of Good, a Holocaust parable that barely registers a pulse.
2 ||| Viggo Mortensen looks the part but never brings it home with great conviction or passion. I never believed in the character and that greatly diminished the film's ability to argue its ethical case.
2 ||| The banality of evil is a rich subject; the cluelessness of same, not so much.
2 ||| A worthy attempt to give the banality of bureaucratic evil both an individualized credibility and a somber universal warning
2 ||| Fails to convince that this man could remain so removed from the horrifying events unfolding around him.
3 ||| It's a powerful film on its own merits, but it also points out how tame and impotent The Reader is in examining similar issues.
2 ||| "Good" is good news for Viggo Mortensen in that he gets to flex his acting chops in a new direction. But thin directing and screenwriting fail to provide the power needed to bring his performance to life.
2 ||| Good has solid performances, but it has a hollow emotional core and, ultimately, lacks any enough insights and suspense to keep you truly intrigued.
4 ||| Amorim and screenwriter John Wrathall have produced a compelling intellectual exercise, a movie that openly wrangles with complex ethical territory
2 ||| Despite its limitations it is about an important issue, how easy it is to compromise yourself, your ideals, your friendships in times of stress.
3 ||| Mortensen ably carries most of the weight, with a minimalist performance.
3 ||| This isn't gritty realism; it's a morality tale, and it's made with quiet passion and real power
2 ||| Viggo Mortensen stars as Prof John Halder - far too handsome for such a part: in life, the bookish are usually ugly as sin, let's face facts.
2 ||| Ultimately Good, like its central figure, seems to lack the courage of its convictions.
2 ||| A strong cast and good starting material doesn't manage to save this unsuccessful adaptation.
2 ||| By all accounts, Taylor's play was a more experimental piece than this film, in which the production values, like the acting, veer between the acceptable and the stodgy.
2 ||| Not for the first time, great theatre makes for a merely adequate film.
2 ||| It's a thought-provoking theme, which is rather let down by a thoroughly unconvincingly turn from Mortensen.
2 ||| To its credit, Good is at least a piece with something serious to say, with little of the meretricious responsibility-deflecting that The Reader dealt in.
2 ||| We're gearing up for a clunker of a climax involving musically gifted interns at the world's sprucest concentration camp. Mortensen wears it well, but this feels like very old hat.
2 ||| Good's attempts to diagnose the cancerous spread of Nazi influence through Germany's population in the mid-'30s is laudable, but despite Mortensen's stoic talents Halder is just too hollow a character for this to be anything other than a vapid parable.
2 ||| The point is how does a "good" man get seduced by evil? Thing is, the movie's so muted and keeps viewers at such arm's length, you cease to wonder.
2 ||| It is a fine piece of acting from Mortensen, who portrays his character's weakness superbly. But Good sometimes lacks pace and direction. On balance this is an intelligent and sensitive approach to a very dark era of history.
1 ||| It may have been a good stage play: people say it was. But its author, the late C.P. Taylor, was not around to stop it becoming a lousy film.
1 ||| Mortensen isn't bad, though he looks merely absent-minded rather than anguished.
2 ||| There are gripping moments of tough, muscular moral tension, mainly when Isaacs steps in, but these are dissipated by occasionally cringeworthy dialogue and a limply executed bourgeois subtext.
2 ||| The original play, once dubbed one of the 100 best of the century, is fleshed out with skill by Amorim but somehow his film never comes fully to life. Even its melodramatic ending falls flat.
2 ||| Despite strong performances and decent production design, Good lacks the emotional weight it needs to deliver the requisite punch. Disappointing.
2 ||| Set in that weird film version of Nazi Germany full of RADA-trained Home Counties poshos, Good is, in a sense, an amazing achievement- it makes the Holocaust boring.
2 ||| There's probably a great film to be made about the way ordinary Germans succumbed to the allure of Nazism - but this weakly directed film, adapted from CP Taylor's acclaimed 1981 stage play, isn't it.
2 ||| A tale illustrating the banality of evil is as timely as ever but the execution is heavy-handed and even with location filming and elaborate sets it still feels very theatrical.
2 ||| Good isn't great. The film has a quality cast who turn in fine performances in a movie that aims to be profound but isn't.
2 ||| ... unfortunately in the end and the adjective "good" does not sit well with this film. [Full review in Spanish]
3 ||| ...rife with compelling figures that ultimately sustain the viewer's interest even through a few less-than-subtle moments.
3 ||| Much more interested in its interpersonal relationships than it is in climbing a soapbox and preaching to the choir.
3 ||| Focused entirely on these people and how the unplanned relationships affect their lives.
2 ||| The Visitor's allusions to our f----up state-of-affairs feel like gratuitous background noise.
3 ||| This is a simple story of human drama that provides an incentive to spend a couple of hours in a movie theater during a spring that has not provided many such reasons.
3 ||| The curious thing about The Visitor is that even as it goes more or less where you think it will, it still manages to surprise you along the way.
4 ||| The Visitor, featuring an award-caliber performance by Richard Jenkins as the prof, is a heartfelt human drama that sneaks up and floors you.
2 ||| Dull and depressing, The Visitor is leaden, lethargic and full of heavy-handed symbolism. The Statue of Liberty keeps popping up in the movie, which uses it like a cheap stage prop.
3 ||| Far too much of a mixed bag to be completely effective, but allows for some fun and unexpected moments and solid performances.
4 ||| All the main characters are inherently decent, and the humanity of their saga, which centers on illegal immigration, makes for a deeply moving film.
4 ||| [Director Thomas McCarthy] demonstrates a delicate, irresistible touch when it comes to lonely, eccentric characters, but he widens his canvas with a small, resonant story that could be ripped from today's headlines.
4 ||| Best movie I've seen so far this year? Hands down, it's Tom McCarthy's superb The Visitor, which turns Richard Jenkins, one of the best character actors in the business, into a full-fledged star.
3 ||| Both director and cast exhibit the dedication of those who truly believe in the message at hand.
3 ||| Actor/director Tom McCarthy's follow up to his award-winning debut, The Station Agent, avoids any notion of a sophomore curse by being an even more polished effort than his debut.
4 ||| Depicts the way a professor's closed-off heart is opened by music, friendship, and love; one of the most touching and impressive films of the year.
4 ||| While elements of this are sad, at times even downright devastating, the film is ultimately a beating drum signaling the arrival of hope and inspiration.
4 ||| Scores by expanding its scope beyond the hot-button issue of illegal immigration to encompass themes of friendship and breaking free of a stifling routine.
3 ||| Not a polemic, but a character-driven work, made all the more riveting by sensitive performances not only by Jenkins in his first leading role, but the entire cast.
3 ||| Insightful drama shatters post-9/11 stereotypes.
4 ||| Richard Jenkins and "The Visitor" make lovely music together. It's a case of a veteran character actor slipping on a leading role like the most comfortable pair of pants in the world.
4 ||| Thoroughly, refreshingly unique, a film that weaves a tight, timely tale that is equal parts heart-warming and wrenching.
3 ||| not really a film you enjoy, per se. It's more like a feeling you get used to before finally accepting.
4 ||| This gifted writer/director knows how to illuminate those moments in which people realize they have become essential to each other -- that each person's life has been gently changed by the other's presence.
4 ||| McCarthy puts a mark on each film, identifying it as distinctly his own. A couple more like them, and he'll be knighted an auteur.
4 ||| This is a film of our times -- paranoid, heartbroken, disillusioned -- and the rare recent American movie whose characters react the way actual people might.
4 ||| The film addresses the timely issues of post-9/11 immigration and incarceration, but avoids polemics by keeping the focus solely on the human cost of our government's policies.
4 ||| A wonderful human story, a beautifully directed and acted film of rare grace that just might renew your faith in life- and movies.
4 ||| The Visitor is America working out the demons of Sept. 11, 2001. Director Thomas McCarthy brilliantly focuses on characters who love life despite the less savory circumstances surrounding them.
4 ||| The film works foremost as the experience of watching Richard Jenkins inhabit his role.
3 ||| The Visitor is a small movie, but its emotions could not be writ any larger.
4 ||| Awards season may still be many months away, but it's not too early to declare both the filmmaker and Jenkins Oscar-worthy.
3 ||| A smart, beautifully acted character drama.
2 ||| The film becomes less about the suffering of immigrants who have never enjoyed the embrace of Ellis Island than the righteous indignation of a liberal intelligentsia raging against its own powerlessness.
4 ||| The story of Vale's revitalization and his grief is compelling but simple, free of any sentimentality, and marked by powerful performances from Jenkins and Hiam Abbass, who plays Mouna Khalil, Tarek's mother.
2 ||| Definitely a film that marches to its own drumbeat.
3 ||| Poignant, intelligent, thematically nuanced and character-driven, The Visitor is a drama about illegal aliens in which the native son is the brother from another planet.
2 ||| [Director] McCarthy has an undeniable way with actors, and it sustains our interest in this overt Good Samaritan tale.
4 ||| (Richard) Jenkins doesn't waste a motion or a word while bestowing on us an introspective acting clinic. They don't call them character actors for nothing.
3 ||| At first glance Walter isn't a guy you want to spend two hours with. But by the end of the film, you don't want to see him go. Jenkins is like that: He sneaks up on you and steals your heart with light-fingered skill.
3 ||| The Visitor is a tiny treasure of a movie. This is a wistful comedy that quickly finds its rhythm, but never lets that groove become a rut.
4 ||| The real subject here isn't post-9/11 xenophobia but rather friendship, how it changes us, heals us and how the arbitrary intrusion of outside forces both threatens and strengthens us.
4 ||| As close to a perfect movie as we're likely to see this year.
4 ||| The Visitor may not have any big names in its cast, but it certainly makes up for that by having a lot of character.
3 ||| Jenkins, a veteran character actor perhaps best known as the dead father on Six Feet Under, gets the role of a career here...
3 ||| It's almost funny how often and how closely The Visitor teeters toward cliché, only to deliver one gently genuine moment after another.
3 ||| The Visitor might unite both sides of the illegal immigration debate - at least for two hours.
4 ||| Sophisticated, timely and compelling, it's a quintessential post-9/11 drama.
3 ||| Beautifully acted and staged, but at odds with itself: the emphasis is not on the 'visitors' but on the uptight professor, who experiences a spiritual rebirth thanks to the life-affirming presence of his new Third World friends...
3 ||| Cuts across one of the West's most contentious political issues without ever getting political. And it features a terrific lead performance from Jenkins.
4 ||| ...a literate and low-key character study of an ordinary man in depressingly average straits.
4 ||| The charms and wonders of the film lie in the performances of the leads, all of whom are better than perfect -- they feel real.
4 ||| For those who want to see slowly evolving character studies that are very rewarding, THE VISITOR is a bullseye.
3 ||| Surefire material to pluck the heartstrings and for thesentimentally inclined, but...
4 ||| The Visitor presents a rich, complex world where people connect in unexpected ways. It is a fitting follow up to the themes McCarthy covered in The Station Agent.
3 ||| ...extremely well-written and well-acted, but it was far too politically biased...it reminded me of a Soviet or Chinese Communist propaganda film.
3 ||| ...a celebration of multiculturalism as an American virtue.
3 ||| The tension dips occasionally but stick with it and you'll be richly rewarded.
4 ||| A beautiful, quiet, measured movie about the death of some American values since September 11, 2001.
4 ||| Uplifting and undeniably winning in its perceptive landscape, The Visitor is no stranger to compelling filmmaking rooted in gentleness and inspirational fortitude
3 ||| Exactly the type of movie the GOP would rather Americans not see, as it individualizes (rather than demonizes) its foreign characters and provides them with a collective voice that demands to be heard.
3 ||| A showcase role for otherwise supporting actor Richard Jenkins, and he makes the most of it without ever being showy.
3 ||| Jenkins, as always has a quiet, almost apologetic hesitation to his performance that serves him well as Walter....a very sweet and gentle film.
2 ||| The not-so subliminal message about life being fair versus breaking the law isn't enough to carry a film purporting to be a character-driven drama.
3 ||| The best movies are those that understand the human condition and have a personal vision. The Visitor is one of those rare creations. The Visitor is a parable of decency.
2 ||| Its mushy humanism is...insidious.
3 ||| The astonishing sensitivity with which Richard Jenkins approaches his role is nicely complimented by the performances of other cast members.
3 ||| Tasting the bitter fruits of globalization
3 ||| An interesting examination of the unusual relationship between a bored college professor and an illegal immigrant. There are some thought-provoking discussions in the film patched periodically with rough spots.
1 ||| Our patience with the characters' apathy and uninteresting demeanor is not rewarded enough.

2 ||| Un retrato sutil y sensible sobre la inesperada conexión que se produce entre cuatro personas de diferentes culturas y orígenes, y también una postal algo desencantada y agridulce de la Nueva York posterior al 11/9. Destacable actuación protagónica de Ric
3 ||| First with "The Station Agent" and now with "The Visitor" (aka "Muukalainen"), actor-turned-director Tom McCarthy has quickly proven himself a master of the delicately-observed social drama.
4 ||| A haunting, gentle film about humanity post-9/11; lonely, confused, and searching for meaning and connection in an increasingly confusing and chaotic world.
4 ||| He's a professor of music, the young man is a skilled drummer; the emotional ebb and flow between the two is nuanced, and self-revelatory for those who drink it in.
2 ||| ...basically entertaining yet entirely forgettable.
1 ||| Clunky and smug, Meet Bill isn't convincing for one moment.
2 ||| Takes scattershot aim at all manner of appropriate targets-the vapid nature of local television news, the perceived stigma of standing out from the pack in America, the dilemma of dreams deferred and abandoned-but rarely hits the comic bull's-eye.
1 ||| Male midlife crisis presents as pathological self-loathing in Meet Bill, an imperative to which the only sane response is: No thanks.
3 ||| As the movie goes on, you actually end up rooting for this schmuck to take charge of his life, and in a way, the movie is sort of inspiring.
1 ||| The story of a man (Aaron Eckhart) grappling with middle-age ennui at work and at home feels done to death, as does the distracting addition of a spunky rich-kid high schooler.
2 ||| Not even a solid performance can keep the script's problems at bay.
1 ||| You know you're in trouble if the wallpaper is more exciting than anything that happens in front of it.
2 ||| ...a small, low-key drama that's agreeable enough and ultimately elevated by the uniformly superb performances.
1 ||| When the characters in Married Life cry out for help, the entire mise-en-scène stifles them with irony.
2 ||| All over the place in tone, never knowing if it wants to be a relationship comedy, a serious drama or a Hitchcock murder thriller.
3 ||| [Pierce] Brosnan, by the way, should be happy to have left the bonds of being Bond if he continues picking roles this wisely.
2 ||| a cleverly scripted film featuring fine actors doing solid work -- nothing more, nothing less.
3 ||| Sachs avoids the casual misogyny that other filmmakers have brought to similar material.
3 ||| [The] four principal actors are such worthy vehicles for sustaining the throbbing pace and shifting moods of this chamber piece that it's difficult to single anyone out.
3 ||| From the very start, with Doris Day singing "I Can't Give You Anything But Love," this is a captivating, atmospheric thriller with superb performances.
2 ||| Stuck somewhere between a dark comedy and a thriller, director Ira Sachs' Married Life doesn't really work as either, leaving its strong cast adrift.
3 ||| Married Life, a period comedy of manners merged with a suspenseful psychological thriller, aspires to be a hybrid of the sort that Alfred Hitchcock polished to perfection.
2 ||| It's an imitation of life, all right, but without much to say about it.
3 ||| Rather than real emotion, the movie stops at irony...It's an entertaining approach, all right, but it does the material no real service.
2 ||| Just when things should be boiling over, the script goes lukewarm.
3 ||| This subtle dance around morality is as seductive as the elegantly designed rooms it takes place in, where even the shadows are cozy.
2 ||| Maybe it is about compromise, after all, because though Married Life has its moments, it's bewildering as a whole.
2 ||| While I respect what Sachs is attempting to do, and while fleeting moments here and there kept me thoroughly enraptured, by the time it was over I found myself frustratingly disappointed almost beyond words.
2 ||| Married Life suffers from its indecision as to whether to be a sophisticated comedy or a heavy dramatic piece and ends up excelling at neither. It's a regrettable collection of bad choices, missed opportunities and a waste of a great cast.
3 ||| Director Ira Sachs plays it wistful not wayward, sticking to essential melodrama and tidy infidelities while dropping narrative cherry bombs for calculated effect.
2 ||| The multiple endings suggest that the filmmakers themselves never really knew what their movie was about.
4 ||| Both romantic and subtly surprising ... you can think of it as a comedy-of-errors murder mystery as Hitchcock might have adapted Thackeray.
3 ||| Quality actors can inflate standard material like a collagen injection, and great performances help "Married Life" expand beyond the typical double-crossing.
3 ||| It's strange. It's different. It's arresting, and it's definitely intentional. Ira Sachs knew what he wanted to do, and he's a talent worth watching.
2 ||| Sirk or Billy Wilder could have done something with it. Sachs still has a ways to go.
1 ||| Married Life is structured like a Douglas Sirk melodrama or a Hitchcock thriller rather than a mystery, but it's a mystery nonetheless, because it's rarely clear what Sachs intends the movie to be.
3 ||| You may not like it if you insist on counting the deck after the game and coming up with 52. But if you get 51 and are amused by how the missing card was made to vanish, this may be a movie to your liking.
3 ||| There is a lightness and whimsy from the animated opening credits to the bright and explicit glamour of its 1949 world. While the narrative doesn't exactly wink at the camera, it certainly doesn't wallow in what could have been very dark material.
3 ||| Step back to the guilt and self recrimination of the 1940s film noir in a cozy nest of plotting, cyanide and the best friend's lover. Those subject to nostalgia will love this pot boiler every step of the way.
2 ||| Asks the audience to spend a lot of time waiting for not much to happen.
3 ||| Married Life has enough plot twists and moments of high tension to keep the viewer engaged, but the main points of interest are the characters.
3 ||| [Director] Sachs has assembled a stellar ensemble cast, and much of the pleasure of Married Life is watching the subtle detail the actors bring to their roles.
2 ||| Married Life is a sumptuously shot homage to the spirit of noir. It is enjoyably sour for its own sake and not dependent on a gruesome payoff (in fact, it sets up a few that pointedly don't come to pass).
2 ||| A curious, provocative if unsatisfying little movie.
2 ||| It's strange how a movie with this many different things happening could be so dull.
2 ||| This quiet, closed-in picture with its unsurprising twists and turns, lacks the steamy passion of its pulp roots.
2 ||| It is a nicely executed, skillfully acted and atmospheric exercise in genre stage craft, but so dry and low-key that it is never really involving.
2 ||| It oscillates between stale period piece and unengaging melodrama, coyly seducing viewers with the potential it fails to fulfill.
2 ||| Married Life is genteel, well-mannered -- and boring.
4 ||| Offers audiences movie pleasures, as well as emotionally authentic challenges.
4 ||| [Brosnan] provides an odd but appropriate balance of laid-back irony and old-fashioned sentimentality that makes Married Life as interesting as married life itself.
3 ||| The acting is well-done and well-balanced, and Peter Deming's cinematography -- part golden, part somber -- suggests the dark side of postwar prosperity, which Americans had begun to contemplate by 1949.
2 ||| Married Life reveals that playing pretend is not a game for children alone, but rather an artifice that finds its fullest expression in adulthood.
2 ||| In many ways, Married Life is a Coen Brothers knock-off without a bit of the boys' accomplishment or bravado.
4 ||| Married Life gives new meaning to the phrase, "'til death do us part."
2 ||| It's best to ignore these scenes from a marriage; stick with Ingmar Bergman instead.
3 ||| A sly, pitch-black domestic manifesto that's scabrous enough to suggest that if you design your own cage, you'll forget that you're trapped.
2 ||| It's as dry as the martinis these well-dressed stiffs keep ordering at that perfectly preserved oak, leather and velvet bar before hopping into their vintage convertibles.
4 ||| Dramatizes the notion that a person's 'burden of conscience' is not an innate reality but a malleable construct, motivated by narcissism.
3 ||| Agreeable, nicely adult entertainment that's satisfying without ever being exciting.
3 ||| I suspect Hitchcock would enjoy watching this slow-churning thriller, which pilfers a few of the master's storytelling tricks as it revels in its own dark heart.
2 ||| One of the dullest, most thoroughly pointless motion pictures ever made.
2 ||| It's elegant, unhurried, and, if you meet it half way, softly satisfying ... like the muffled clap of a velvet-covered ring box snapping shut.
3 ||| All in all, this was a fun little, old fashioned pot boiler.
2 ||| It swings from Far From Heaven-alike lush melodrama to Double Indemnity-like noir to something approaching black comedy, and the transitions never quite work. Accomplished then, but no classic.
2 ||| A mannered comedy of manners that, in its eagerness to be all things to all people, ends up being nothing much of anything.
2 ||| It looks beautiful, and the convoluted plotting is initially the right side of Hitchcock pastiche, but the central conundrum is teased out over so many twists and false climaxes that ultimately it's a shrug, not a shock, which greets the denouement.
3 ||| Superbly directed, thought-provoking blend of Hitchcock movies, 1940s pastiche and Bette Davis-style melodrama, featuring terrific performances from Cooper and Clarkson.
3 ||| Thought-provoking themes swirl around in this drama, brought to life by a skilled cast and a director who plays with Hitchcockian themes and imagery. In the end, it feels a bit undercooked, but the actors keep us glued to the screen.
2 ||| It's a good cast, with Cooper outstanding, but Sachs's direction is stodgy and the screenplay is grindingly self-conscious.
2 ||| The acting is as classy and well-realised as the lush 1940s period detail, yet this entertainingly entangled, ersatz noir is frustrating because it never fully gels.
2 ||| The tangled web which slowly causes the film's relationships to disintegrate is brilliantly woven. However, you can't help wishing the climax packs a bit more of a dramatic punch.
2 ||| A classy cast and production design to die for are the only features of note in an underpowered tale of adultery and intrigue in '50s America.
2 ||| Married Life may fall short of the best Hollywood melodrama, but its nicely observed situations and old-fashioned storytelling ironically lend this a freshness more on-the-nose infidelity tales are missing.
2 ||| A well-acted but lugubrious noir, which is somehow not quite thrilling enough to be a thriller, and not quite profound enough to be a character study.
2 ||| The layers of deception are as meticulously constructed as the impeccable 1940s production and costume design. Unfortunately, the film doesn't maintain that distinctive noir cruelty, as hard as red lacquered finger nails.
3 ||| Once he gets out from under his influences and trusts his own gut, Sachs might become a major director.
2 ||| One of the more ethically dubious films to come out of Hollywood in years.
3 ||| This darkly comic dramatic thriller, which is set just after World War II, is more than merely watchable. It's very smart and is old-fashioned in several respects.
2 ||| It is as though filmmaker Ira Sachs fears that just making a film about infidelity is too straight, too pedestrian, so, he's got to introduce the possibility that murder is on the horizon.
2 ||| The United States' well-off middle class of the 1950s, its taboos, stereotypes and lifestyles, are reflected in this interesting and harsh film. [Full review in Spanish]
2 ||| Clocking in at just under three hours, writer-director Francesco Lucente's earnest attempt at making an Iraq War-era Coming Home says many things at once without much perspective or clarity.
2 ||| The mawkish yet weirdly mesmerizing film Badland is independent in scale but aggressively Hollywood in storytelling.
0 ||| The year's dullest movie has arrived: the deeply silly Badland, which is as dead as winter and twice as long.
2 ||| Possibly the worst idea for a movie this century.
4 ||| Expertly constructed and beautifully photographed, Badland easily sustains its 160-minute running time, and the portrayals of Draven, a British actor, and 9-year-old Fulton can stand alongside the year's best.
2 ||| Until the mess in the Middle East has found its way to a resolution, we can continue to expect films like Badland as part of the collateral damage in the War on Terror.
2 ||| Some good performances. But, the overall disturbing atmosphere of the film is more than I prefer. That said, I appreciate the effort to raise awareness of PTSD.
2 ||| Exploiting what it is supposed to renounce, Badland combines a dreadfully long and dull screenplay and extremely plain surroundings to make a well-meaning anti-war film you'll want to miss.
1 ||| An unrelentingly bleak and depressing drama about an Iraqi war veteran who is unable to deal with his rage.
2 ||| Badland is a good 30-45 minutes too long.
2 ||| Not so terrible that you can understand why it's been practically buried by its distributors, but you can get better ridiculous whodunits on TV.
2 ||| The murders are simply chalk marks on a blackboard with no build-up and little fallout.
1 ||| Disappointing, badly plotted thriller, let down by some dodgy acting, poor direction and a script that makes The Da Vinci Code look like a masterpiece.
2 ||| A math- and symbology-tinged thriller adapted by director Álex de la Iglesia, and pitched at a breakneck, didactic clip, absent any sensible, modulated emotional investment in the characters or material.
2 ||| A poorly formulated story that's nearly impossible to understand and accept.
2 ||| Hurt sells the silliness almost convincingly, but even from such a skillful pitchman it comes out sounding, finally, like junk.
1 ||| This purported whodunit thriller never solves its main mystery: How and why did this film get made in the first place?
1 ||| The villain may be Untraceable, but it's easy to pin down the influences of Gregory Hoblit's serial killer snoozer.
2 ||| Untraceable engenders a reaction that is one part fascination, one part disappointment, and two parts frustration.
1 ||| This tepid, borderline offensive cyber-serial killer thriller takes what feels like ages to rehash both better and worse examples of the current, vapid clamor for so-called 'torture porn.'
0 ||| Talk about your pious frauds. I've got a better way to show your disgust for Internet scum: Don't see Untraceable.
1 ||| It's a tame version of Saw, aimed at middle-aged America, with the same lack of brains and appeal.
1 ||| Seriously, I don't have time for this. In point of fact, neither should audiences. This movie is a piece of recycled garbage and is a waste Lane's, and pretty much everyone else's in the cast, talents.
2 ||| Even director Gregory Hoblit couldn't transform Untraceable from a mediocre horror movie into a compelling thriller.
2 ||| In a genre that's already died a thousand mediocre movie deaths, Untraceable is not the last stab into its heart of darkness. Instead, it's the cinematic equivalent of a blueprint...
1 ||| 'Untraceable' is a thriller about computers that was probably written by one.
2 ||| More concerned about coming up with graphic death scenes than anything else.
2 ||| While certain aspects are comparable to great suspense films like Seven and The Vanishing, the underlying ethical lessons in the film pluck the thrill out of the thriller. What's left is a preachy and predictable paradox.
1 ||| It appears to have been designed to appeal only to those who will sit through even the most ploddingly paced and gruesomely icky police procedurals,have an unyielding fondness for Diane Lane and who have never once touched a computer in their lives
1 ||| a well-worn piece of formula produced with just enough professionalism to make it clear that those who made it should have known better
2 ||| A great idea for a horror movie, Untraceable taps directly into the consciousness of America today... yet its execution is rushed.
2 ||| Just as you are starting to think, 'Hey, this isn't so bad,' Untraceable takes a dive off the cliff even the Russian judge will give a perfect score to
2 ||| With no suspense, no surprises and no rush, it's just soft core torture porn.
2 ||| Sets the tone with an opening suite of scenes that put a kitty in danger.
2 ||| Too bad the movie is put together by the numbers instead of being character-driven.
2 ||| A run-of-the-mill thriller that lacks the substance to be anything more than forgettable.
2 ||| In addition to being dull, Untraceable is a monster hypocrite, wagging its finger at the mass audience's appetite for strictly regimented, 'creative' torture scenarios. This film is not really in a position to point a finger.
2 ||| Assumes that the country is full of perverted, bloodthirsty sketchballs without actually wondering who these people are.
2 ||| Untraceable wants us to deplore the amoral voyeurism of the cyberspace mobs, yet feeds off it at the same time.
1 ||| Torture porn for housewives.
1 ||| There's a good movie to be made about the power of the virtual mob, the ethical consequences of participating in it, the costs of free will. But Untraceable isn't it, not by a long shot.
2 ||| Life is too short for long-term exposure to relentless agony and distress, even in the guise of entertainment.
2 ||| Wow, can that Diane Lane work a wireless mouse. And she typed that Control ALT Delete with such authority! Oh, my -- what was that? -- she minimized a window and activated a program with a hot key!
0 ||| When Lane isn't preaching about the heinous violence, she's babbling on in tech speak. It's like having a Dell rep describe the plot of Saw.
2 ||| A blatantly derivative serial killer thriller that proceeds to tick off every single cliché of the genre ... has nothing to offer beyond what we've already seen before.
3 ||| Untraceable may not rank as one of the best serial-killer thrillers of all time, but it packs enough punch to hold your attention way past the whodunit point.
2 ||| Morally duplicitous torture porn: how else to describe Untraceable, a bleak, rain-washed horror thriller.
2 ||| Untraceable feels sleazy and gratuitous.
2 ||| In case you didn't catch it, the moral is that each time we indulge our inner voyeur by visiting macabre websites or tuning into salacious tabloid news, we're implicated in the larger cultural crime.
2 ||| Untraceable demonstrates, once again, how unnecessary it is for audiences actually to understand technical jargon.
0 ||| As plain awful as Untraceable is, possibly the worst thing about it is that it pretends to mean something.
1 ||| It can't have been easy for hundreds of actors, technicians and stunt people to show up for work every day to make a movie whose message is, essentially: Don't go see this movie.
1 ||| Untraceable isn't unwatchable, but it's a pretty miserable experience, from a director who knows better.
2 ||| Untraceable often seems to go out of its way to tip off what's coming, so that it's hard to tell whether the film's writers are lazy, clumsy or just painfully obvious.
1 ||| Hateful, brutalizing, inexcusable.
2 ||| Technology is the film's only hook. Otherwise, it's a standard B-movie thriller featuring basement torture chambers and an FBI agent-single mom who tracks a killer before becoming a target herself.
2 ||| From its obvious foreshadowing to Marsh's big PowerPoint presentation of the killer's cause-and-effect, Untraceable is a mite too traceable to get under the skin.
1 ||| The movie chides us for being a sick voyeuristic society, hungry for the sight of violence. The purity of this moral stance is somewhat clouded by the movie's habit of staging sick violent acts.
2 ||| Untraceable essentially forces its audience to identify with those who would be willing accomplices to torture and murder.
2 ||| A diverting police procedural.
2 ||| The agony of Untraceable is as predictable as a computer program, and about as inhuman.
2 ||| Untraceable mostly delivers the chills, despite its conventionalities.
2 ||| A competent but unremarkable crime thriller.
2 ||| This serial killer mystery has a good cast and a reasonable story and it could have been solid, but the plot thickens via acts of such abject stupidity that the movie is eventually ruined.
2 ||| The film teases and unnerves for 100 minutes with scenes of cold brutality. Then in a rush to the end, it tries to make it all better, or at least make it more complicated.
2 ||| Hoblit and veteran cinematographer Anastas Michos try to darken the proceedings by giving us nocturnal characters and Portland at its grayest. But it's window dressing, just like the layers of computer geek-speak that can't disguise an analog-age plot.
2 ||| An abhorrent cyberthriller starring a compelling Diane Lane, the film exploits the inhumanity of torture as it cynically condemns Internet rubberneckers (and by extension, moviegoers) for watching it online.
2 ||| The makers of Untraceable don't have that high an opinion of you.
3 ||| Untraceable is a horrifying thriller, smart and tightly told, and merciless.
2 ||| What amounts to being a solid thriller collapses into an absurd potboiler as though the scriptwriters ran out of ideas.
2 ||| If I can forgive Lane for dating uber-douchebag Jon Bon Jovi, marrying Christopher Highlander 2 Lambert, and making Must Love Dogs, I can forgive her this.
2 ||| While Untraceable is an amiable enough way to kill two hours, it never gels into the kind of movie that would make me run out and start endorsing it to others.
1 ||| Is it really ethical for a film to warn of the irresistible appeal of online snuff films while it simultaneously indulges, practically pornographically, in graphic displays of the same sort of kinky perversion?
2 ||| Just a bland crime movie that puts too much faith in an overbaked concept.
1 ||| Geeky, gruesome and repugnant.
2 ||| Imagine Hostel with a CSI twist and done for the Oxygen network crowd, and you'll have an idea of what Untraceable is like.
2 ||| Untraceable is a movie whose potential was tossed aside for the conventional trappings of the serial-killer genre.
1 ||| Untraceable? You'll only wish it was.
2 ||| "Untraceable" certainly isn't unwatchable, but it is a bit unbelievable, rather predictable and more than a little bit gruesome (-able?)
2 ||| Untraceable? Unappetizing is more like it - or perhaps unrealistic, unconvincing and/or unexciting.
2 ||| The movie flirts with snuff-film torture porn, then has the cast-iron nerve to segue into preachy tut-tutting about what a society of voyeurs we are.
2 ||| Here's an interesting concept that could have been so much more. And its de-volution isn't "Untraceable" %u2013 you can watch it dissolve after the solid setup.
1 ||| Exploits the very trend it condemns.
2 ||| Feels as if it's been patched together using 'auto-fill' screenwriting software.
2 ||| "It's a jungle in there!" sighs Hanks as he counts the millions visiting the movie's kill-view website. But for all its scaremongering, Untraceable is best viewed as an above-average thriller with a tech-savvy hook.
1 ||| You know something ain't kosher when a movie purporting to offer a critique of sadistic voyeurism opens with a hand-rubbing scene of kitten abuse.
1 ||| Untraceable is nothing more than a paint-by-numbers suspense thriller undeserving of your mental bandwidth.
2 ||| A competent suspenser, helped by the always-dependable Diane Lane, but it suffers by following the modern thriller playbook to the letter.
2 ||| Even though this film strains to be another Silence of the Lambs (tormented heroine chases nasty killer), it's still oddly involving.
2 ||| Enjoyable thriller, enlivened by a decent script, impressive direction and strong performances from Diane Lane and Colin Hanks.
2 ||| Lane is an imaginative actress, every bit as good as Jodie Foster, and the film is clothed in a dark and chilly atmosphere that Hoblit constructs with some skill.
2 ||| Some viewers might find the Hostel-style splatter hard to stomach while, for a smart cop, Lane sure does some dumb things.
2 ||| The problem with Hollywood films condemning the public appetite for torture is that they frequently pander to it, and this is a very lurid and unsavoury example.
2 ||| This new variation on the theme isn't bad, in a gruesome and horrible way, and features a strong performance from Diane Lane as an FBI agent.
2 ||| On the surface the film is a solid thriller, but there's more thought here than in the average serial killer flick.
2 ||| Very enjoyable as a 'race against time' thriller and Lane is great as the weary but determined lead. It's just a shame that Untraceable's message is delivered in such a ham-fisted, hypocritical way.
2 ||| In keeping with the title, this Silence Of The Lambs wannabe contains not a trace of originality, but should appeal to those who like their thrillers with a side order of gore.
1 ||| [T]he honkingly stupid script is the kind that inspires Mystery Science Theater call-and-response.
2 ||| Part of the problem with "Untraceable" is the identity of the killer behind the Web site is revealed way too early, thus taking most of the mystery out of the movie.
3 ||| Neither terrible nor memorable, Untraceable is the sort of movie that lives up to its name %u2013 within an hour of seeing it, memories of it will vanish without a trace.
2 ||| ...a generic, garden-variety thriller that's almost entirely lacking in genuine thrills or surprises...
2 ||| Untraceable will have steam for a little while and then it is just going to die down and become the $5.99 movie at Walmart.
2 ||| Bah! What a lame-o thriller.
2 ||| Previsível e desinteressante, tenta contornar a trama clichê com cenas que investem na violência gráfica, mas sem sucesso.
3 ||| If you aren't a fan of scary thrillers, you're going to want to give this one a wide berth. But if you're aching for your next dose of suspense drama adrenaline, Untraceable may just do the trick.
2 ||| While certainly compelling in terms of drawing you into the story, Untraceable has a number of nagging narrative flaws.
2 ||| Cookie cutter police procedural with a Hostel tinge.
2 ||| Untraceable is prototype Internet conspiracy drivel, with a hackneyed plot years too late and a simple premise of good cops and innocents against sickos.
1 ||| Untraceable boasts a respected director (Gregory Hoblit of Fracture and Primal Fear), and a popular movie star (Diane Lane) but it's still about people getting tortured to death.
2 ||| Untraceable is a thriller with a heavy moral compass which shines a bright light on internet ethics.
2 ||| For all the would-be with-it cyber/techno-speak, strip that all away, and Gregory Hoblit's film is completely stale and cliched thriller nonsense.
1 ||| An ugly, blank slate of a film, one that feels like a rough outline for one of the better Ellis adaptations.
0 ||| Perhaps the only use this film has is to give philosophers who sit through it some way of experiencing what eternity truly means.
2 ||| [Features] a ludicrously concocted, thoroughly unconvincing narrative and the pervading sense of style supplanting substance.
2 ||| The Informers is the kind of movie that, upon leaving the theater, provokes the urge to take a shower.
2 ||| Occasionally, some fool gets the idea that his literary wretched excess would make for a good film.
2 ||| I don't find The Informers to be without interest -- unlike most critics -- but neither do I find it successful enough to recommend it.
2 ||| The Informers delivers a muddled message.
0 ||| Do some blow. Curse humanity. Convert to nilhilism. Reread American Psycho. But don't for the love of God and cinema see The Informers.
1 ||| It's a movie with Altmanesque pretensions, but under Gregor Jordan's flat-line direction amounts to flipping through an out-of-date fashion magazine, one that barely spurs the energy to point and laugh.
1 ||| This sprawling, wanna-be Short Cuts tale is so over-the-top and so insufferably unpleasant that it makes even his infamous "American Psycho" seem tame by comparison.
3 ||| Ellis, director Gregor Jordan and a cast that's hollow but only occasionally empty, manage to anticipate excess' hangover, a headache we've become intimately familiar with -- all over again.
1 ||| Ellis' book, though a grim read, had a satirical edge to it that made it darkly enjoyable; the movie is simply dark and dull. And vampireless, more's the pity.
1 ||| The piece had better have something fresh to say. The Informers doesn't, nor does it seem to want to.
1 ||| There's no real structure to Jordan's film, so stories haphazardly begin and disappear without ending
1 ||| The dialogue is laughable. Lines are spoken so languidly that the actors seem bored. Shattering revelations are delivered in the same monotone as casual patter.
3 ||| Excels in the mysterious tension found when someone who doesn't care talks to someone who does.
2 ||| The result turns the novel's cynical satire into a facile morality play, in which these privileged children want to be told the difference between right and wrong.
1 ||| Perhaps the film's biggest mistake is that after more than an hour of proving how pointless and vapid these characters are, it leaves us with a parting shot indicating we should care about what happens to them. We don't.
2 ||| An outbreak of '80s nostalgia is the best explanation for The Informers, a worse movie based on a worse Bret Easton Ellis book.
2 ||| If The Informers doesn't sound to you like a pleasant time at the movies, you are right.
4 ||| Aesthetically pretty, subjectively ugly, and emotionally incisive, the picture celebrates the passing of a not-so-innocent era and mourns the victims left in its wake.
0 ||| The Informers is a movie so seamy it makes you want to take a bath afterward. Rarely has so much sin seemed so boring.
1 ||| Ellis doesn't create a single authentic moment or sympathetic character in this lurid pastiche of disconnected vignettes.
1 ||| This one's a certifiable soul-sucker, dining out on its characters' venalities while wagging a finger at the horror, the horror.
1 ||| Gregor Jordan's pointless adaptation of a Bret Easton Ellis book is successful only in the sense that it accurately mimics the emptiness of its subject.
1 ||| It's almost a relief when one of the characters comes down with a deadly disease.
1 ||| The film is as flat as the Hollywood sign, with beautiful young people, all blonde, mostly naked, trying desperately to get up the energy to order something else from room service.
1 ||| There seems to be no point to this derivative Bret Easton Ellis retro-wallow. It's all sex, drugs, rock 'n roll and boredom - with the emphasis on boredom.
1 ||| The performances run the gamut from twitchy to catatonic, and the stoned stiffness of the actors seems to have less to do with the affectlessness of the characters than with their own confusion.
2 ||| Ellis's big notions are less insightful than they pretend to be.
1 ||| Though name actors and the involvement of a cult author may eventually get The Informers attention, there's nobody who loves the '80s enough to knowingly pay good money to suffer through all 98 minutes of this.
3 ||| Has an air of detachment and sadness, enhanced by the movie's being set a full quarter century ago. Like new cars in an old movie, these people may glow with youth, but we watch them in full awareness of the beaters and wrecks they'll become.
0 ||| The movie has more dead scenes than a Monday night in Magnitogorsk.
1 ||| An awful film about an awful time.
2 ||| Is there an easier target for satire than Hollywood? Or a duller one?
0 ||| Just because your characters are vacuous, less-than-zero types, it doesn't necessarily mean that the tone and structure of your movie has to adopt the same conditions.
2 ||| An aimless mess. But at least the mess is sexy and exciting.
1 ||| Remember the '80s? After sitting through The Informers you may wanna burn your Rubik's Cube and "Where's the Beef" T-shirt.
2 ||| The Informers is grimy, nasty and graphic in its depictions of excess, and those are its good points.
2 ||| This is nothing more than Short Cuts with shortcuts
3 ||| I wish they'd kept the vampire. I wish they'd given him a rocket launcher.
1 ||| Despite a terrific ensemble cast, The Informers suffers from an uneven, chaotic screenplay with forgettable, poorly developed characters while none of the actors or actresses get a chance to shine. It never really gels into a sharp, compelling or e
1 ||| The Informers becomes that rare movie that is so tedious it dares you to keep watching.
1 ||| Filled with narcissistic twits who never say or do anything of consequence or interest.
2 ||| Life is a bitch and then you go to L.A.
2 ||| ...a dreary, loosely connected parade of drug-, drink- and sex-sodden lost souls.
1 ||| Imagine Absolutely Fabulous without Edina and Patsy, or Dynasty without Alexis, and what have you got? The Informers.
2 ||| We may not care about these cokeheads, but only rarely does Jordan fall into knee-jerk retribution.
3 ||| A lurid, soapy, moralistic melodrama so mucky you'll need a shower.
2 ||| Directed by Gregor Jordan, Ellis's aimlessly dissolute collection of stories just doesn't hang together as a coherent whole.
1 ||| There is a weird, almost comic absence of insight and perspective here. But it is a joke without humour and without a punchline.
2 ||| This self-penned adaptation of his 1994 short story collection - a period piece set in 1983 Los Angeles - has supposedly been cut to ribbons, and it shows.
2 ||| Jordan gives all this an entirely appropriate sheen and the cast play well through glazed eyes. The film will fascinate those who love to see the tormented lives of those who seem luckier than the rest of us.
2 ||| Failing to work on so many levels, The Informers operates as a time capsule of 1983 and a time when substance was negated in favour of style. Sadly, this movie is severely lacking in both of those departments.
2 ||| For diehard Ellis completists only.
2 ||| It's an empty shell entertaining a nasty streak of misogyny, a single note ensemble piece that's very much less than zero.
0 ||| This film is bad - really, really bad.
1 ||| A star-studded mess.
1 ||| Director Gregor Jordan seems to have gone into reverse since his 2001 Buffalo Soldiers, aiming for the LA rondeau of Altman's Short Cuts but missing all the vital ingredients - wit, humanity, charm, nuance and meaning.
2 ||| The Informers isn't dull but the characters are hollow and the dialogue stilted. In the hands of the film's less experienced actors, it verges on the embarrassing.
2 ||| None of the characters are particularly appealing and it ultimately fails to engage on an emotional level.
2 ||| Watching people live such vacuous, clone-like lives of privilege and decadence, it's impossible to feel anything for them.
2 ||| The Informers proves once again that Ellis's stories are difficult to realise for the big screen and perhaps best left for the printed page and the imagination.
2 ||| Much of it remains purposefully pointless, and Ellis and Jordan never attempt to reframe the dead-eyed hedonism and solipsism that makes these characters very hard to care about.
2 ||| It has a good cast and a terrific 1980s soundtrack (Devo, Simple Minds), but it also has the superficiality of a TV soap. The Informers is not so bad that you can't sit back and enjoy it, but nor is it good enough to go and see.
2 ||| While it's an occasionally unsettling piece - and comes with a big-name cast - the story never goes anywhere.
1 ||| ...a ninety-eight-minute snooze-fest.
1 ||| Imagine American Psycho with less violence but more nudity, transplanted from New York to California and stripped of all self-awareness. That's The Informers.
1 ||| Brad Renfro in his last movie role, playing a wannabe film actor who sprays out filthy perspiration like a collie emerging from a sewer. It's possible this role killed Renfro.
2 ||| As in Land Without Bread and The Bridge, Meeting Resistance raises all sorts of ethical questions about its making.
2 ||| Filmed during the first year of the U.S. occupation of Iraq, Meeting Resistance suffers from the same problem as the Iraq-set feature film The Situation %u2013 timeliness.
2 ||| An eye-opening documentary that reveals the diversity and zeal of the resistance movement in Iraq to the U.S. occupation of their homeland.
2 ||| A little resistance might have done the project some good.
3 ||| If nothing else, Meeting Resistance should dispel any lingering misconception that the Iraq insurgency is mainly the work of outside agitators.
2 ||| The problem with the film is that it makes for better journalism than cinema.
3 ||| Meeting Resistance is worth the effort. It tells a nuanced story of the Iraqi resistance that American media rarely has fleshed out.
2 ||| It offers no judgment, nor does it proffer a solution, but this slow-paced and vivid glimpse behind the veil is an achievement and an education.
4 ||| Of all the Iraq documentaries that have been released since the war began five years ago, this is the one that most seriously addresses the nature of the insurgency.
4 ||| Again and again Iraqis cite restoring their pride and dignity as their reasons for planting roadside bombs, firing RPGs and lobbing mortars into the Green Zone.Hell hath no fury like a Muslim humiliated!
4 ||| So consistently daffy and free-spirited, it simply defies audiences to dislike it.
4 ||| There have been a lot of movies where stars have repeated the triumphs of their parts - but has any star ever done it more triumphantly than Marlon Brando does in The Freshman?
3 ||| Forget Brando. Andrew Bergman is the star here.
3 ||| An amusing Brando and a komodo dragon - it doesn't get better in this story of a naif in the big city.
4 ||| brando's personal godfather sequel
3 ||| Clever comedy with Brando showing a good sense of humor about himself.
2 ||| Sort of amusing. Good turn by Brando.
3 ||| A perfectly-paced, winning comedy
3 ||| A witty and enchanted comedy.
4 ||| One of the most savagely underrated films of the 1990s.
3 ||| Broderick is his usual charming self, and there are occasional moments of inspired whimsy or absurdity.
3 ||| An underrated hidden treasure.
3 ||| Here's a chance to see a mellow Marlon Brando in his greatest comedy performance.
4 ||| Andrew Bergman's The Freshman is a charmed comedy, the kind of seemingly effortless movie in which everything falls neatly into place, as if ordained by nature.
3 ||| Brando does a wonderful sendup of Corleone that manages to play off the Don's entrenched place in pop culture. But The Freshman is no copycat comedy.
3 ||| The Freshman has dead spots, certainly, but makes up for them with its moments of inspired craziness.
2 ||| Though writer-director Andrew Bergman sets up potentially funny situations, the payoffs aren't nearly as clever as they need to be. Many situations don't pay off at all.
3 ||| Just when you've had it with the mistimed scenes and the clunky direction, writer-director Andrew Bergman comes through with an inspired piece of lunacy.
4 ||| It's the kind of material that could easily fly apart into silliness, yet Brando and Broderick help the director to keep it anchored in a certain emotional reality, which is always the source of the richest comedy.
4 ||| Marlon Brando returns to the movies with one of his funniest performances as, in essence, Don Corleone with a screw loose.
2 ||| Bruno Kirby provides an added shot as Brando's wiseguy right-hand man, and Paul Benedict practically steals the film as the over-opinionated film prof.
4 ||| Marlon Brando delivers six-minute sonatinas of send-up and sincerity. He keeps things light but also from tilting over into something ephemerally broad like, say, "Mickey Blue Eyes,"a perfectly enjoyable comedy but a piffle next to this perfection.
2 ||| The film isn't illuminating, just inflammatory.
2 ||| With so much pointless violence for the sake of violence and a terrible non-sensical ending, this film is a grueling and pointless exercise that never fully delivers on its premise.
3 ||| It may seem an odd thing to say about a film in which a baseball bat as an instrument of assault and rape is a recurring theme, but what makes A Bloody Aria a darkly delightful surprise is its restraint.
2 ||| For the most part A Bloody Aria has an adept way of muddying these themes for audiences expecting the usual gore-thirsty trip.
2 ||| will ultimately confound American audiences who don't appreciate the complexities of the Korean national psyche
2 ||| It would have been fine but the acting is pretty over the top, making scenes almost laughable.
3 ||| Still, Won pulls off a rare trick: to be funny and frightening while continuing to ratch the tension up and up. Performances, too, are top notch.
3 ||| A gripping, disconcerting and thought-provoking exercise that eschews graphic horror in favour of complex, darkly funny psychological drama.
1 ||| It's slow, bloody and pretty much devoid of merit.
2 ||| Despite the title, A Bloody Aria is unlikely to be music to the ears of extreme cinema fans.
1 ||| Sore disappointment is in store for anyone expecting Won Shin-yun's revenge/psycho thriller to emerge as the new Oldboy.
3 ||| Won's critique of the abuse of power in South Korean society lacks trenchancy, but he subverts convention with an incisiveness lacking in much transatlantic horror.
2 ||| I suspect it falls between two stools: not nearly grisly enough for the aficionado of extreme Asian cinema, rather too grisly for everyone else.
2 ||| It all looks like Michael Haneke-lite but, as a comment upon the fact that people tamed by violence tend to promote it when given half a chance, it has its grimly amusing merits.
3 ||| Korean filmmaker Won uses a startlingly in-your-face style for this outrageous examination of bullying at all kinds of levels. Both unsettling and entertaining, it also finds real terror and black humour in the least likely places.
3 ||| The perfect antidote to any disappointing summer blockbuster.
3 ||| The result is a minor masterpiece of tone in Kenny's portrayal of a character that is absurd, guileless and shrewd at the same time.
3 ||| Waste is a terrible thing to mind -- unless you are port-a-potty installer Kenny Smyth, the unlikely hero of a hilarious and fresh (figuratively speaking, of course) comedy from Down Under.
3 ||| I sense that the Jacobson brothers set out to make a simple little comedy. But how grand it must be for them to see the humanity of their fresh, inventive film rising to the level of its humor.
3 ||| A hit and prize winner in Australia, Kenny has the power to charm, no matter which way the water swirls.
3 ||| The film's real accomplishment, in this era of masked superheroes, is making a paladin of a regular guy whose ethics we can all emulate.
3 ||| Funny, accessible and ultimately a good time.
4 ||| Kenny is always there in an instant with a philosophical quip and a stoic resolution.
2 ||| Old-fashioned toilet humour gets a postmodern makeover in this laconic Australian mockumentary about a mobile toilet installer.
3 ||| Kenny is hilarious - toilet humour and all - and surprisingly touching. Just remember to wash your hands afterwards.
3 ||| Charming comedy with a strong script and a delightful central performance from Shane Jacobson.
3 ||| An unexpectedly charming and bitingly funny mock doc.
2 ||| Rainn Wilson has already been typecast as "that weird, crazy guy" in every role he plays, but he seems capable of more.
2 ||| It's exactly the kind of film that I'll forget having ever seen by the time Summer is over and that's too bad as I do love the premise of the film and I'm a fan of Rainn Wilson.
2 ||| This is pre-packaged entertainment, a product designed to give bored teenagers something to watch on a Friday or Saturday night when steamy summer nights are getting longer and Labor Day is just around the corner.
3 ||| A great cast, solid writing, some poppy head-bopping tunes and a story full of warmth and laughs often makes up for its sometimes predictable high concept plot.
2 ||| Lightweight but likable.
2 ||| I guess if you like Rainn Wilson alot, you might enjoy it. But I find his humor flat and tedious. I can't believe this is from the Oscar-nominated director who made THE FULL MONTY.
2 ||| may not rock your world, but it's a sweet little fable that doesn't trouble itself with reality
3 ||| A comedy in the vein of "School of Rock," "The Rocker" is a fine first starring vehicle for "The Office" star Wilson.
2 ||| Feels like another one of those movies Will Ferrell turned down, so the producers had to find the next best thing (and Jack Black was already under contract to do something else).
2 ||| Makes up for a lack of gut-busting moments simply by being genial and smartly written. The Rocker is a minor, feel-good entertainment. It's not rocket science, but its heart is in the right place.
1 ||| Certainly nothing this year will compete with the inexcusable The Love Guru for its sheer inability to create laughs, but The Rocker does its best to at least come close.
2 ||| Wilson is buoyed by a sporadically witty script, and while there are no surprises whatsoever in the story, his goofy, puppylike charm renders what could have been a disaster merely an unfortunate event.
2 ||| Jack Black's fearless, foolish ferocity is missing.
2 ||| Like its protagonist, the movie is sweet but slow and a little out of date.
2 ||| Audiences would be better served staying home and playing Rock Band than wasting their time on something as leaden and unfunny as The Rocker.
2 ||| The real problem, of course, is that Fish isn't all that interesting a protagonist.
2 ||| Rainn Wilson said in an interview on The Rocker: 'There is something about a drummer. They're not cerebral. I have a tendency to be more cerebral and reserved. But he's a big puppy dog. It was lot of fun to plunge into that character.'"
2 ||| A wealth of creative talent can't alter the fact that Rocker is merely a passable goof-off, and one less challenging or fun than a night spent playing Rock Band.
2 ||| Appeals to the part of you that dreams of stage diving, counting groupies and trashing hotel rooms.
3 ||| Breezily directed by The Full Monty's Peter Cattaneo, this amiable comedy features a solid supporting cast and the original songs, written by Chad Fischer of 'Superman' fame, are surprisingly good in a hooky, power-pop sort of way.
2 ||| I'm a drummer. Drummers aren't dorky. They are the heart and soul of a band, solid, dependable. Drummers aren't clueless or socially awkward. Guitarists on the other hand ...
2 ||| The film equivalent of an inoffensive throwaway track, what we used to call a B-side, back in the days of Vesuvius.
2 ||| A grubby little redemption comedy that in every way feels like a consignment-shop Jack Black vehicle.
2 ||| The Rocker is an amiable comedy, so efficiently constructed that you can practically see the computer software on how to write comedy screenplays at work. Nonetheless it is an enjoyable construction.
1 ||| It's too bad the unambitious Rocker didn't give those fine performers more to do. As it is, it's only half a screenplay, and theirs is the half that's missing.
2 ||| An innocuous late-summer entry that barely rises above the level of sitcom alternative to Olympic-coverage overload.
2 ||| The Rocker feels safe, a long way from the cutting edge, a PG guy in a PG-13 movie, a comedy with too much 'parental guidance' to be rock 'n' roll.
3 ||| If this isn't the laugh riot of the year, it's still a pleasant surprise, particularly for teen audiences. And in comedy seasons like this one, that's sometimes more than enough.
2 ||| The Rocker qualifies as a B-side, but it still makes for a passable summer single.
2 ||| Watching Rainn Wilson gyrate in The Rocker, you can't help wondering if Mr. Wilson is inhabiting a role that was originally turned down by Jack Black.
3 ||| Manages to be a notably funnier than average summer comedy despite being a fairly shameless rip-off of School of Rock.
2 ||| While nobody's expecting This Is Spinal Tap, both the audience and the cast -- which is strong all around -- deserve better than the generic script and bland direction here.
2 ||| The cinematic equivalent of elevator music: bland, occasionally entertaining and, once it's over, utterly forgettable.
2 ||| How much you ultimately like The Rocker will inevitably depend on how much you like Wilson. And a little goes a long way.
2 ||| The film gets credit for heart, and a certain amount of rock 'n' roll spirit, but that's about it.
2 ||| You want to like almost everyone in this film, but they're all undone by a weak script that really wasn't worth more than a Gilmore Girls subplot after all.
1 ||| Tuneless execution, with flat writing and inharmonious direction as noticeable as Motley Crue's eyeliner. Or Whitesnake's snakeskin pants.
2 ||| It can be hard to explain what makes a star, but it's fairly easy to identify a performer who doesn't have that mysterious star stuff.
3 ||| While The Rocker may be completely unoriginal and campy at times, the film still exceeds well with great laughs and a couple of one-liners I will be adding to my collection.
2 ||| Despite its breezy quality and occasional big laugh, The Rocker just never completely clicks as A-side material.
2 ||| No matter how much a movie tries to convince us, emo will never rock.
2 ||| Utterly predictable, formulaic, but not entirely unamusing.
3 ||| I don't want to oversell The Rocker, but in a summer of erratic, assaultive comedies all up and down the budget scale, this Rainn Wilson vehicle -- a kind of Home School of Rock -- stakes out its own corner of the market.
2 ||| Sadly, The Rocker is so rife with formula that a pre-school could wet nurse on it indefinitely and still never go hungry.
2 ||| Some laughs, but this is no School of Rock.
3 ||| "The Rocker" is a likeable but sometimes awkward comedy about a likeable, awkward musician.
2 ||| I felt nothing for the characters, and worse, I didn't care if Fish confronted his old band members and got even.
1 ||| Is it possible for a movie to actually kill rock n' roll?
3 ||| I had a really good time watching The Rocker. I laughed, I tapped my foot to the music, and I reveled in the extraordinary Rainn Wilson.
2 ||| Wilson's amiably wild-eyed performance hits all the scripted notes in a comedy that is mostly tone-deaf.
2 ||| The Rocker ends up doing more to whet appetites for School of Rock 2 than it does to actually entertain.
2 ||| I don't doubt you can find some sort of enjoyment in watching The Rocker, but it's just one of those movies you'll forget about in a couple days.
2 ||| As a satire of the music biz and in micro, long-haired heavy metal bands, the film's obviously no 'This is Spinal Tap,' and the new songs are forgettable, just like the overall film, even if (or because) Wilson does a good Jack Black impersonation.
1 ||| Memo to Rainn Wilson: A shot of a paunchy middle-aged man in jockey shorts is not automatically funny. Okay, it kind of is. But The Rocker is as formulaic as a Whitesnake song without the virtue of a four-minute running time.
2 ||| The melody of The Rocker feels predictable but the beat is refreshingly off-kilter.
3 ||| Predictable, but fun.
2 ||| The pratfalls and naked jokes don't eek out enough humor, and Wilson's Fish never becomes someone you can truly root for.
2 ||| There's nothing all that wrong with The Rocker. It's just that it's ordinary to a spectacular degree.
2 ||| The Rocker neither rocks nor rolls.
2 ||| To those moviegoers who've expressed some weariness of Will Ferrell and Jack Black always doing what they do: Well, OK, here's somebody else doing it.
2 ||| One of the problems of Peter Cattaneo's film is not knowing who it's aimed at. Kids won't identify with a bitter old rocker and the middle-aged will be hoping for more satirical Spinal Tap.
2 ||| Likeable, if predictable comedy, enlivened by strong comic performances from Rainn Wilson and a talented supporting cast.
2 ||| As a movie, it may not rock, but it rolls along nicely enough.
2 ||| Amiable enough yet unadventurous and uneven, this may coax the odd big smile from viewers but it never rocks the house.
2 ||| There are occasionally amusing moments, but the writing lacks the warmth that made School of Rock such a hit.
2 ||| It all looks good and there's a decent cast but nothing really takes off.
2 ||| Essentially covering the same playlist as Jack Black's School of Rock, The Rocker is a good-natured, live-the-dream lark in which the one-liners score hits but the slapstick continually misses.
3 ||| Just the feelgood movie that everyone needs at the moment.
2 ||| Director Peter Cattaneo will probably never repeat his Full Monty success, but even in its mediocre patches one senses a renewed eagerness to entertain.
2 ||| A decent US ensemble cast includes regulars from Curb Your Enthusiasm and, though the pacing is too slack, some silly one-liners help to make up for it.
2 ||| The Rocker is certainly not This Is Spinal Tap, but it is fair to moderate entertainment and Rainn Wilson holds it all together energetically.
2 ||| Essentially a Will Ferrell Lite movie, this toothless comedy has a likeable central performance from Rainn Wilson and several hilariously spiky side characters. But it never quite hits its comical stride.
2 ||| Uh, Mr. Projectionist? Could you stop the movie? I wanna get off now.
2 ||| This rock music comedy does has a few chuckles and belly laughs. And unlike a few other smug, self-satisfied comedies that have come along recently, this one at least seems to have a heart at its center.
2 ||| Just when you think the dog days of summer movies are upon us along comes a hilarious sleeper hit.
2 ||| All premise and no purpose.
2 ||| ...an agreeable, sporadically hilarious comedy that benefits substantially from the almost uniformly strong performances.
0 ||| Just because one is a scene stealer on TV does not mean he or she is big screen material, period, much less a movie star.
2 ||| The Rocker is more Keane than Keith Moon: slow, safe and about as edgy as a tangerine.
2 ||| Be grateful that Gabrielle Union and Morris Chestnut have the wherewithal to elevate a mediocre script.
2 ||| Stay for the nail-biting conclusion, but only if you can stomach the horror of Queen Latifah and Terrence Howard reaching career lows as manifestations of all that is cheerful and insufferable, respectively, about the holidays.
0 ||| About as appetizing as a candy cane laced with arsenic.
1 ||| In the annals of Noel films so wincingly, gratingly, insultingly bad that a lump of coal would be vastly preferable, The Perfect Holiday ranks alongside Surviving Christmas for sheer unwatchability.
1 ||| Not perfect. Not really about a holiday. At least 'The' is accurate!
2 ||| The cast is game, the script is watered nog, the kids push their charm hard, Murphy is often excruciating, Union is pleasant in a sitcom mommy way, and Lance Rivera is a zero stylist.
1 ||| Ostensibly a Christmastime comedy about romance, The Perfect Holiday manages to be none of the above.
2 ||| Despite the flabby direction and uninspired plot, The Perfect Holiday almost works because Chestnut and Union are an attractive couple and you want them to get together.
2 ||| The likable cast and the script's low-key humor help, as does Howard's soulful, if fleeting, presence.
2 ||| Jovial and junky as all get out, The Perfect Holiday is about what you'd expect from a holiday comedy daring to put 'perfect' in its title. As in anything but.
2 ||| The Perfect Holiday, as many a holiday movie before it, meticulously goes through the motions, but never quite finds the magic of the season.
1 ||| The Perfect Holiday, directed by Lance Rivera, is that most dispiriting product, a formulaic movie that doesn't believe in itself.
1 ||| The cold void of January can't come fast enough if it means an end to releases like The Perfect Holiday.
2 ||| It's a shame that Gabrielle Union can't get better scripts than this one.
1 ||| Queen Latifah often is the saving grace of many of the movies she's in. That can't be said of her latest, however.
2 ||| Dear Santa: Please leave better scripts under her Christmas tree.
2 ||| There's not much original about the film, but it's played with high spirits and good cheer, there are lots of musical interludes, and it's pitched straight at families.
0 ||| For fans of lousy seasonal cheer, Dec. 25 comes early.
2 ||| If you've seen every slushy, sentimental Christmas movie on the Hallmark Channel and are still able to keep your breakfast down, you might want to catch this.
2 ||| Queen Latifah and Terrence Howard act as commentators, nudging the contrivances this way and that.
1 ||| Belying its title, the film does little to inspire good cheer toward its various imperfections. Maybe I should find Santa and ask for better films. You'll certainly wish I had if you're unfortunate enough to sit through this 'gift.'
2 ||| Most people seeing this movie might wonder what Queen Latifah did to convince Terrence Howard to take on what will surely be his worst role of the year.
2 ||| Is The Perfect Holiday a good film? The answer is: not really, but it isn't terrible.
2 ||| In one scene, Terrence Howard kneels in a pair of shoes like Tim Conway in a 'Dorf on Golf' video, licks a lollipop and utters this line: 'I gotta go dookie.' I hope they paid him well.
2 ||| ...a clumsy mess of silly contrivances and musty sight gags...
2 ||| There's no rush to see this disappointing excuse for a holiday film.
2 ||| The movie's reach extends beyond it's grasp.
1 ||| It's deplorable that these two stars have been reduced to appearing in such garbage.
2 ||| Bad Santa! No cookie!
2 ||| "The Perfect Holiday" isn't perfect. But it does contain moments of merriment.
2 ||| Christmas fable is cute and tame, but unoriginal.
1 ||| Love eventually conquers all, as expected, but not before we're forced to sit through a nearly endless parade of clichs, unfunny jokes, and empty drama.
2 ||| Union, who's as impossibly beautiful as Chestnut is good looking, fares better here.
3 ||| The film works on a slow burn but by the end it has become utterly engrossing.
3 ||| Thriambos toy sfihtoy senarioy me stoho kai apopsi kai tis aplis kinimatografisis me emfasi stin oysia tis, to La Graine et le Mulet einai eykola ap' tis kalyteres tainies tis hronias. To mono hreiazetai, einai to tharros na mpeis stin aithoysa, ki as' to
3 ||| Aside from a slight flabbiness ... Kechiche is to be praised for exploring the nature of change on a personal and a community level -- and packing the result with some emotional wallop.
3 ||| Wonderfully directed, beautifully acted and thoroughly engaging drama that's so naturalistic that you often feel you're watching a documentary.
3 ||| This is both fascinating domestic melodrama and damning indictment of the intolerance that can exist across all sections of society.
2 ||| The film manages to be both an homage to women and a heartbreaking cultural commentary, and it's intense.
3 ||| Give some patience to The Secret of the Grain and the rewards are there for the reaping.
4 ||| [A] captivating film.
2 ||| After two and a half hours, The Secret of the Grain, ends, as arbitrarily as it began.
3 ||| The Secret of the Grain is crowd-pleasing in the sense that the story and characters are easy to identify with...belongs somewhere between the arthouse and the multiplex.
3 ||| The best scenes in Tunisian-French writer-director Abdellatif Kechiche's The Secret of the Grain resemble the unique protean bouillabaisses found in port cities.
3 ||| A robust drama about and old man with a dream who is helped by a smart teenager and his large Franco-Arab family.
3 ||| The cast is solid, with standout performances by first-timer Habib Boufares as Slimane.
4 ||| The richness of The Secret of the Grain lies in the close, tireless, enthusiastic attention it pays to the most mundane daily tasks.
4 ||| The Secret of the Grain is one of the most remarkable films of 2008, in part because it masterfully extends certain sequences not only to let them play out before our eyes but also to invite reflection even as the film is still running.
3 ||| Before you scoff at yet another benevolent look at a family straddling two cultures, Kechiche subtly subverts the genre.
4 ||| The Secret of the Grain never slows, always engages, may continue too long, but ends too soon. It is made of life itself.
4 ||| The wonderful thing about Hafsia Herzi in The Secret of the Grain...is the way she and the character tiptoe around the story's edges for a while, taking their time and easing onto the audience's radar.
4 ||| Rather than observing this family, we feel we are part of it, and that draws us in as nothing else can.
4 ||| The Secret of the Grain takes one man, his children, their spouses and babies, his ex-wife, his girlfriend, her daughter, and his friends and turns it all into a masterpiece about the strange power of food -- to heal, unite, exasperate.
3 ||| Writer-director Abdel Kechiche has wrought a definitive statement on how it feels to live in a subculture.
2 ||| Despite some strong performances from the mostly amateur cast, as well as some intriguing insights into family dysfunctions and racial prejudice, the movie still comes across as being self-indulgent and at least a little disappointing.
4 ||| A dark and hilarious parable of human absurdity.
4 ||| Never sagging, it unfolds over 2 1/2 hours. Nothing is overexplained. Indeed, it takes us time to suss out Slimane's various familial relationships.
3 ||| Secret of the Grain may be the most ambitious, complex, and suspenseful film about a feast ever to be served at the movies.
4 ||| When the film, as it must, comes to an end after two and a half hours, you won't be ready; the bond made to this family makes its sudden absence feel downright brutal. [Blu-ray]
3 ||| Many great suspense sequences have been built around props: a bomb under the table, explosives in the back of the truck, a nuclear launch code. And now couscous.
3 ||| This depiction of Arab family life with all its attendant problems shares with comparable drama La Haine an empathy for immigrants.
2 ||| Whatever it was these filmmakers were hoping to achieve, I very much doubt the reaction they were looking for was "weird".
2 ||| Director Silberberg should have known better than to go with this draft by TV writers Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas, an "SNL" shtick-meister.
2 ||| McBride and Ferrell, who seems content to spin his wheels in vehicles that indulge his passion for stripping and dumbing down, are gifted performers. Here, they are given little to work with, and deliver accordingly.
2 ||| Many of the bits are far too adult for children, yet no adult with a brain bigger than a walnut -- inside joke the filmmakers evidently thought was hilarious -- would find the story the least bit compelling.
2 ||| Stupid on an epic scale or epic on a stupid one, Land of the Lost is as close as Will Ferrell comes these days to a 'kid friendly' movie.
2 ||| Land of the Lost is halfway toward amusing, which means it's just as close to awful.
2 ||| Land of the Lost is only one hour and 36 minutes long, but it could easily be 15 minutes shorter without the scenes of Ferrell's meandering ad-libs.
3 ||| An amusing and incredibly strange experience that might have you laughing at the ballsiness of pulling something as crazy as this off.
2 ||| Land of the Lost becomes an endurance test -- one that's too borderline bawdy for families and too dull and rote for anyone over 15. Who, exactly, is the intended audience for this drivel?
2 ||| This only intermittently amusing film isn't going to win over any new fans of the divisive Will Ferrell.
2 ||| Genially terrible, Lost is lazy, sloppy multiplex filler, good for a few solid giggles and not much more.
1 ||| (T)he equivalent of a nonsexual succubus, slowly sucking out the audience's intellect with each succeeding scene.
1 ||| This Land exists at the bottom of the pop-cultural barrel.
4 ||| Audiences of a certain sort will be dumbstruck by how high the silliness gets piled; but whether or not you're puffin' stuff, you'll likely get lost in laughter.
1 ||| On the Ferrell scale, Land of the Lost ranks squarely below Anchorman and leagues above Semi-Pro, landing right in that murky middle-ground Talladega Nights territory. Let your tolerance level for the comedian be your guide. If
1 ||| Land of the Lost is, unfortunately, a perfect example of studio bloat: It's all noise and flash and chaos, but it lacks virtually everything that made the original television series so memorable.
3 ||| An aggressively weird, suitably uneven and decidedly un-kid-friendly keg-stand of nostalgia for those unable to scrub the fever-dream of a series from their memories.
3 ||| Confronted with such effects, the actors make not the slightest effort to appear terrified, amazed or sometimes even mildly concerned. Some might consider that a weakness. I suspect it is more of a deliberate choice, and I say I enjoyed it.
1 ||| Tonally inconsistent, incoherently plotted and almost never funny.
0 ||| The Will Ferrell Comedy Train might be out of steam.
3 ||| Maybe those lowered expectations played some part, but I was very, very surprised by the actual movie.
3 ||| a dumb, fun amusement park ride, and it touched a certain level of childlike excitement in myself. I'm a little embarrassed to admit it, but I had a blast watching it.
0 ||| Pity the unwitting parents who take their kids to see Land of the Lost, Will Ferrell's terminally stupid, sloppy, campy and cheesy -- and thoroughly unexciting and unfunny -- experiment in 'family entertainment.'
3 ||| Always weird, sometimes aimless but occasionally really funny.
1 ||| Land of the Lost seems more intent on being off-putting than being funny. Mission accomplished, I guess, but it's not entertaining. And whoever thought it would be must have been out of his gourd.
1 ||| As long as you enjoy the actors involved, Land of the Lost will mostly deliver. If you don't, you'll vanish into an entertainment void all your own.
1 ||| The only discernible intention in Land of the Lost, the latest comedy starring Will Ferrell acting like Will Ferrell, seems to have been to take a slight idea and make the least of it in a very expensive way.
1 ||| The biggest disappointment of the summer movie season.
3 ||| A mostly funny bowl of Dumb with the nutritional equivalent of all those giant bowls of Froot Loops you ate while watching cartoons back in the day.
0 ||| Land of the Lost isn't a movie, it's an endurance test.
1 ||| The only positive thing I can say about Land of the Lost is that it's so bad perhaps it will put an end to the classic-TV-to-film machine.
1 ||| Tiresome, repetitive and time-warped, the title says it all.
0 ||| Defying space and time, we will see one of the worse films of this year.
1 ||| Will Ferrell's latest movie fiasco is just one more nail in the coffin of his career
1 ||| Caught in an unfunny netherworld between kid-oriented mainstream summer entertainment and a cheap-looking green-screened sort of surreality, it might have been a watchable, no, bearable movie had it just embraced one or the other fully.
0 ||| The ideal viewer would be, I guess, a 5-year-old who still thinks dinosaurs and urine jokes are cool, but realizes they pale in comparison with breasts and gropings.
1 ||| Nothing at all besides two funnymen and one disposable, objectified woman running from place to place, screaming a bit, joking about bodily functions, and running around a bit more.
1 ||| The original was unbelievably cheesy in its special effects but more sophisticated in its concepts, employing real science-fiction writers to work up ideas. Will Ferrell and partners have succeeded in reversing those priorities in this spoof.
1 ||| Somewhere in a distant corner of the near infinite universe there must be a life form that finds Will Ferrell funny. Come and take him. Please.
3 ||| The great irony of the new big-screen Land of the Lost adaptation is that the filmmakers have spent a reported $100 million to make a movie that looks like it cost $1.95. And you know what? In a weird kind of way, I actually appreciate that ethic
1 ||| Lost is putting it mildly.
0 ||| There are countless mentions of feces and urine. A woman is fondled several times. The lead character mouths a two-word vulgarity to another character.
1 ||| If you hated the show, you'll hate this even more. If you loved it, prepare to find your precious childhood memories drenched (literally) in dinosaur pee.
3 ||| Land of the Lost the movie is upbeat, pretty silly, but funny in enough portion to render it pleasant, with heavy reliance on the tongue-in-cheek art of understatement.
1 ||| Be it dead serious, moronic racecar driver Ricky Bobby or idiotic, deadpan Ron Burgandy, Ferrell has managed to create quite the niche for himself as the honest, earnest moron.
1 ||| The humour is lame and more than a little smutty, while the plot barely hangs together.
0 ||| The funniest aspect of this turkey is that it cost more than $100 million to make, yet it still looks like something assembled by idiots. It's one of the most abject family films ever to have slithered out of Hollywood's nether regions.
1 ||| Will Ferrell capers earnestly through a Journey to the Center of the Earth-style comic romp witless of script, wan of invention and pasty of imagery.
1 ||| It's a kind of cut-price Jurassic Park, with a support cast of gabbling monkeys and lizardish humanoids, and if they don't seem far-fetched you might believe Anna Friel as a Cambridge- educated scientist.
3 ||| The insane comedy/action hybrid emerges as a nutty, funny, unashamedly weird action comedy hybrid that is more consistently laugh-grabbing than many of its contemporaries doing far better business at the box office.
1 ||| It's far too raunchy for family audiences, nowhere near funny enough to satisfy comedy fans, and asks us to get all nostalgic about a 70s TV show that nobody in the UK has heard about.
1 ||| A jumbled, incoherent mess of ad-libbed indulgences.
1 ||| In a summer of terrible blockbusters, Land of the Lost's ability to distinguish itself as the worst of the bunch (so far) is almost commendable, given that its awfulness appears to have been achieved so effortlessly.
1 ||| There's a docu-drama to be made about movies like this. About how no-one had the courage to tell the star: This ain't funny!
1 ||| By and large, it's knockabout kids' stuff (and has been advertised on that basis), but it has some quite risqué smut.
1 ||| ...the film boasts a pervasively puerile sensibility that's reflected in virtually all of its attributes...
1 ||| Ladies and gentlemen- this is it. This is the moment where Will Ferrell's shtick (already wearing thin after his last couple of films) officially got old.
3 ||| Land of the Lost is a terrible family film - let's just get that out there - but it is certain to live on as a staple of bleary-eyed uni students' movie nights; sandwiched in-between repeat viewings of The Wall.
1 ||| Who is this movie being made for in the first place?
3 ||| ...this experience feels like being trapped in a haunted maze and there are images here that are the stuff of nightmares.
3 ||| [Rec] is wonderfully paced and there are some genuine scares as bodies unexpectedly fall into frame or jump out of the darkness.
3 ||| Rec] is a great if you're after some scares, and it will definitely have you squirming in your seat.
4 ||| A shock-a-minute mini-masterpiece of sound design, tricky jolts, and wonderfully distressing tension.
4 ||| ...boasts a number of brutal and unexpectedly creepy interludes that instantly set it apart from its stylistically-similar yet thoroughly inferior brethren...
4 ||| While utterly nihilistic in its attempts to disorient the audience, the directors keep "[REC]" a consistently terrifying experience with some of the most gruesome deaths filmed...
3 ||| An unexceptional workout for the adrenaline glands nudged up several notches by a climax that will cause muchos trouser trauma to all but the recently deceased.
3 ||| The final reel is real eyes-behind-your-fingers type stuff with the filmmakers cranking up the audience's apprehension to I-really-would-rather-be-somewhere-else levels.
3 ||| A brilliantly staged early scare signals that the safety rails are off and, despite an unexpected, last-minute swerve into the supernatural realm, the edge-of-the-seat tension is sustained to the very last second.
4 ||| At its best, "[REC]" is a stress test, with genuinely frightening and surreal use of grainy, fidgety camerawork and eerie night-vision.
3 ||| i usually hate these movies, but i kinda liked this one
3 ||| einai akoma kalytero apo oso akoygetai, kai oti tha 'thelan na ginoyn otan megalosoyn oi shetikes prospatheies apo The Blair Witch Project (1999), mehri The Zombie Diaries (2006), Diary of the Dead (2007) i Cloverfield (2008)
4 ||| [REC] is ridiculously good. It's a show-stopping terror trip through something that really shouldn't work all that well.
3 ||| A well-made funhouse ride of pure terror and near-breathless dread.
3 ||| Impressiona pelo ritmo, pelas atuações, pela intensidade e pela excepcional edição de som, revelando-se sempre tenso e, nos melhores momentos, absolutamente assustador.
4 ||| Not since John Carpenter's one-shot intro to Halloween has POV horror been this good.
4 ||| Superbly acted, brilliantly directed and absolutely bloody terrifying, this is one of the best films of the year.
4 ||| If you're going to a horror movie, it's because you want to be scared senseless. In this regard, they don't come better than [REC].
4 ||| A sterling effort in the eventually overplayed "found footage" genre.
3 ||| Don't come looking for subtlety or subtext - this offers wall-to-wall thrills and intensity, period.
3 ||| Co-directors Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza unfold their story over a tight, tense 75 minutes, using the hand-held camera to create an atmosphere of immediacy, and never wasting an opportunity to ramp up the sense of panic, or provide a brutal scare.
4 ||| ...Rifkin's voyeuristic modus operandi ultimately transforms the film into an unexpectedly compelling piece of work.
3 ||| Like Short Cuts absent Altman's metaphysical heft, Look is an oddly compelling little film.
0 ||| Monumentally stupid on every level ... This movie sucks.
3 ||| Orwell would have loved it.
3 ||| Even if "Look" exploits reality TV by boosting a sub-marginal plot with very realistic security camera footage it is still a great perspective into our brave new world
3 ||| The effectiveness of it in capturing our attention attests to very fine writing and editing which serve the mockumentary framework with immediate gripping power.
3 ||| the role Brigette Bardot was born to play, and it is the role for which she will most likely be remembered
3 ||| It may fall short of Donnie Darko's clever storytelling, but for his third feature film, Kelly plays confidently with suspense and lays down the right hooks at the right time to keep you drawn into his creepy world.
3 ||| A moody antidote to the freakshow of Southland Tales, The Box feels like Richard Kelly's spiritual sequel to Donnie Darko -- foreboding and off-kilter, it's a late-night riff on '70s sci-fi that confirms the director as an original.
3 ||| The interesting thing about Richard Kelly's films is that in none of them do you know exactly what's happening, and it does not really matter, because there is such a wealth of imagination there. I found it very impressive.
3 ||| The Box lacks the poetry and elegance of Darko, and at times mistakes randomness for mystery, however a good cast and pace mean those who enjoy debating what they just saw will have plenty to work over.
4 ||| "Much weirder and more serious than it appears to be in the ads."
3 ||| The critical consensus is still out on Kelly, and The Box will do nothing to settle the ongoing argument regarding his ability to coalesce his wild conceits into digestible narratives.
1 ||| Have you ever actually tried watching paint dry? A sloth walk? Grass grow? You can have all the thrills with none of the chills courtesy of The Box, the painfully sluggish new sci-fi morality play from Donnie Darko creator Richard Kelly.
3 ||| The Box is a dreary and engaging brain trip into the world of Richard Kelly. This is where he's comfortable, this is where he succeeds and this is where he triumphs.
1 ||| Sci-fi lovers should find it risible, and those who devalue the genre will have their biases confirmed.
3 ||| It's not slick, standard sci-fi, sure -- and that's a good thing.
3 ||| as it was with Kelly's last film, the widely despised, decade-defining Southland Tales, The Box never allows you to get your hands completely around it
3 ||| Though his narrative's morality-play suspense and Bernard Herrmann-esque score recall Hitchcock, Kelly seems to have selected the '70s so that he can fully channel early-years Steven Spielberg.
3 ||| A sequence shot in the Boston Public Library (even though the film is set in Virginia) is creepier than anything in the splatterporn movies that pass for horror these days.
3 ||| The Box is an enigma in modern Hollywood. I am actually pretty surprised it was allowed to make it through the system, though I am very happy that it did.
1 ||| After a slightly promising start, this great-looking but ultimately deeply confusing and unscary sci-fi/horror opus turns into a quite boring rehash of M. Night Shyamalan's post-Signs films.
3 ||| If you make a preposterous movie that isn't boring, I count that as some kind of a triumph.
3 ||| A confounding sci-fi mystery on one level and a tortured existential treatise on the other, pondering the nature of man in relation to God.
0 ||| The audience is subject to a constant tone of foreboding danger, but The Box is more tease than delivery.
3 ||| The Box is a fantastically made thriller that brilliantly captures the tone of the 70's and makes you ponder in a negative way about humanity.
3 ||| The Box...breezes right past slick, pre-packed sci-fi to find a resting place somewhere in the outlandish and exceedingly eccentric world of artists so true to themselves that their work inspires and infuriates in equal measure.
1 ||| Some directors, it must be said, only have one really good movie in them. We're starting to worry that Richard Kelly may be among this select group.
3 ||| An ethically rich drama about the mystery of not knowing, greed, responsibility, free will, and altruism.
4 ||| What seems on the surface to be just another hacky sellout from a once-interesting filmmaker on the commercial skids is actually one of the most genuinely freaky and fascinating films of the year.
3 ||| This picture moved me and made me think, and while the items on the filmmaker's mind aren't exactly earth shattering to me they were deeply affecting all the same.
1 ||| Never has Richard Matheson's visionary work been so badly served! This is foolish, maudlin, confusing, pretentious poppycock.
0 ||| What The Box resembles most, in fact, is a distended episode of "The Simpsons"' annual Halloween special.
3 ||| ...phantasmagorical, dark, drear, and troubling, it kept me involved and thinking about it long after...that's a good definition of an entertaining movie.
1 ||| Creepy thriller too confusing for kids, awful for adults.
4 ||| The best thing about the movie is that, if Kelly was really aiming to please the average popcorn-munchers, he fails. He can't help it.
3 ||| The dude behind Donnie Darko and kid from Richmond's South Side has crafted the kind of movie that will have some diggin' its trippy cosmic karma, and others trashing its gimmick gone wild.
1 ||| An interesting subtext occurs with this particular "box." More than just rude slang for a woman's genitalia, the title points to the fact that in this story, it's only the ladies who misbehave. Issues, Mr. Kelly?
3 ||| As fresh and imaginative as a well made "Twilight Zone" episode.
3 ||| The first half is a brilliantly realized exercise in sustained tension; the suspense fades as the story becomes increasingly bizarre...
3 ||| Both its imagination and its ambition sprint far beyond anything offered in the creatively neutered likes of Disney's A Christmas Carol or Law Abiding Citizen.
3 ||| A cool, philosophical mindfreak.
1 ||| A box full of boredom.
3 ||| There's plenty to like in a film that proves Richard Kelly's touch hasn't deserted him after Southland Tales' critical and commercial battering.
3 ||| Movie Marmite. Many will be perplexed. Donnie Darko fans should lap it up.
1 ||| Think very carefully before you attempt to unlock the mysteries of The Box. There is no going back, you cannot undo your decision, you will never get back those 115 minutes, and by the horrifying end, those same 115 minutes will feel like a life sentence.
1 ||| The clueless and overreaching ambition which has started to characterise [Richard Kelly's] cinematic failures comes into play again.
1 ||| A certain faecal word certainly sums up the artistic merits of The Box, a tedious and often excruciating production from Donnie Darko director Richard Kelly.
0 ||| People start wandering about in a zomboid fashion but no one notices. The acting deteriorates into overwrought melodramatics. The plot gets sillier and sillier, and makes less and less sense. The Box should be taken away in one, and speedily buried.
1 ||| Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko made him famous, but to judge by this unhappy mess he's having trouble confirming his talent.
1 ||| The single question I wanted to ask was: how many more times will a studio allow Richard Kelly to commit career suicide?
3 ||| With excellent period detail, it's a high-concept premise deftly handled by the director and beautifully played by Diaz and Marsden who turns out to be a bit of an acting revelation.
1 ||| The acting is stiff, the special effects look cheap and the dialogue is unintentionally funny.
3 ||| For those willing to follow Kelly down all the rabbit holes his warped imagination contrives, there are small treasures to be found here and there.
3 ||| The consequence of free will is examined in Richard Kelly's mind bending morality tale, The Box.
3 ||| Richard Matheson probably wouldn't care for Kelly's adaptation too much because it certainly goes its own way. It's not perfect; it's a little slow and plodding and has a few characters that don't add much to the overall affect. But it's still quite good.
4 ||| Total head-scratch entertainment.
0 ||| A shallow and easily-forgettable thriller.
1 ||| What they end up deciding sets in slothlike motion a convoluted string of ludicrous events that will take writer-director Richard Kelly years to live down.
3 ||| Surprisingly moving proof that you can take a man out of the movies, but you can't take the movies out of the man.
3 ||| Once its machinery is humming, it settles into a soothing fable of a last hurrah.
3 ||| [An] elegant documentary.
1 ||| The movie works so hard at juggling its clichs that it fails to generate interest in its story.
3 ||| It's hard to imagine anyone other than Christopher Plummer taking on the role of Flash Madden.
3 ||| Plummer, a Hollywood legend who has never been nominated for an Oscar, offers one of his finer performances.
0 ||| UNDOING is a perfect example of how NOT to make an independent film.
3 ||| There's something to be said for a chomp-em-up tale that exhibits some class, intensity, and restraint.
3 ||| "Black Water" is the scariest film of its type since "Jaws" - you'll wanna strap in for this one ... otherwise you'll be continuously jumping out of your seat. One of the most genuinely scary films I've seen in a long time.
3 ||| Loosely adapted from Ben Mezrich's best-selling Bringing Down the House, the movie stretches facts like taffy but never shirks its responsibility to entertain.
3 ||| Loose moral messages and flaws in the plot don't add up to screenwriting and directing that draw an ace, but beating the house with intellect will always be a winning hand.
3 ||| Manages to make the act of counting cards seem as exciting as this past winter's Super Bowl -- and as perilous as climbing Mount Everest with both eyes closed.
3 ||| Jim Sturgess turns up the heat as an untapped genius who takes a walk on the wild side.
3 ||| has a flashy, exciting vibe early on to make the audience feel like they are in the middle of that blackjack table and casino (I almost went All In with my popcorn and peanut M&M's)
1 ||| You have a director so inept that he doesn't even understand what genre he's working within and he's helped destroy potentially one of the most riveting and important social statements about Las Vegas the movies could have seen.
1 ||| ...the film quickly devolves into an interminable mess of hoary cliches and stale conventions (a trying-on-clothes montage? Really?)
3 ||| 21 makes for some slick escapist fantasy. Even if, and because, the fantasy has its roots in something real.
1 ||| Greed is good and comes without a hint of conscience in 21, a feature-length bore about some smarty-pants who take Vegas for a ride.
3 ||| A pulse-poundingly high-spirited and extremely well-directed drama. If 21 is only one thing, it's intoxicating.
3 ||| You'll have fun at 21 but will walk out of the theater a little bit lighter in the pocket, wondering where the time went.
3 ||| 21 is not the deepest or most emotionally resonant of the casino films, and it doesn't completely get the psychology of gambling, but it's a lot of fun nonetheless.
3 ||| 21 blows the endgame when a jarring shift to a con-game finale turns an intriguing drama into just another popcorn movie - the movie equivalent of saying 'hit me' when you've got a 17 showing.
4 ||| This is really Spacey's picture, from the moment he fixes his gaze on Sturgess to the day when he finally, brutally cuts him loose. It's a fun performance, but a quiet one.
1 ||| A slick, soulless nightmare of a film with the moral center of a porno flick and a central character so shallow, loathsome and uninteresting that you keep hoping that the guys from "Funny Games" will show up and give him exactly what he deserves.
3 ||| Another average film that could have had so much more to offer if the screenplay followed more closely to the actual events.
3 ||| Here's the deal: this is sheer escapist entertainment - and, as such, it's a good gamble.
3 ||| While this isn't my idea of a movie that's really based on a true story, "21" still deals out an entertaining thriller.
3 ||| Some folks are calling 21 racist because Sturgess was cast as Ben Campbell, the main character, instead of someone - anyone - Asian. This is a fair battle to pick, but ...
1 ||| A film that makes Rounders seem like a work of great seriousness and import.
1 ||| The whizzo-conceit and slick visual bling do give it an undeniably diverting buzz, yet the movie's cautionary formula shows its hand way before the clunky final reel.
3 ||| It is the gilded embodiment of the American Dream.
3 ||| The movie introduces a world and sells it extremely well. It does a good job of explaining the rules of the card-counting scam, and the actual blackjack scenes are quite exciting
3 ||| It didn't blow me away, but it was an entertaining way to spend 2 hours.
3 ||| After all the dramatizing to protect the innocent is done, the story has a nice, comfy Hollywood ending (complete with baked goods), but it's fun to ride the myth for a while, especially with such comely partners.
3 ||| Regardless whether there are a number of clichés and plot incongruities, this entertaining and fast-paced flick will find an audience hoping to learn how to beat the dealer.
1 ||| When the movie 21 was announced with Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne, it sounded like a winner. When everybody else involved in 21 was mentioned, it was doomed to be a loser.
1 ||| Craps out leaving you wondering how it all went so wrong.
3 ||| No lavish costume drama, it's instead a theatrical dissection of the spiteful games lovers play.
3 ||| A rewarding and cleverly constructed experiment - but not one that is easy to enjoy or warm to. All will agree that it's a fine thing that Rivette should still be pushing the boundaries, few will actually want to watch him doing it.
3 ||| The whole thing is compelling from start to finish; 'cruel ironies' doesn't even begin to describe it.
3 ||| Demonstrando uma quase reverência às origens de seu projeto, Rivette cria um roteiro que retém a natureza literária da narrativa.
4 ||| The film is a piercing pas de deux that excoriates romance even as its doomed characters are consumed by it.
4 ||| The latest film from master French director Jacques Rivette is a masterful, multilayered, sometimes enigmatic work of dark irony, an assured tragicomedy of manners and more.
3 ||| so completely ousts love and romance as a mere act that you expect curtains to sweep in at the end.
3 ||| A scarred war hero and a delicately placed courtesan spar amongst the moldering walls of Restoration Paris. A graceful story of love's struggles amidst a brutal social climate of denial and despair.
3 ||| After more than 50 years of idiosyncratic filmmaking, Rivette, who turns 80 on Saturday, is as intense and rigorous an artist as ever.
3 ||| A study in 19th-century European extremes, The Duchess of Langeais may put you off at first, but its playful tone could just as easily leave you pleasantly exhausted.
4 ||| Without Rivette's usual daring or playfulness, but still a highly accomplished entry in the lazy, stagnant "costume movie" genre.
4 ||| The movie's satisfactions are subtle, but they run deep, and there are many.
4 ||| Based on a Balzac story, Rivette's Duchess manages to be both old-fashioned in its settings and circumstances, and coolly modern in its view of thwarted passion and despair.
4 ||| Jacques Rivette's Duchess of Langeais seems to me a nearly impeccable work of art -- beautiful, true, profound.
1 ||| Classy? Yes,
3 ||| The director guides the viewer through a sly consideration of near-sociopathic not-quite-lovers, one of whom finds refuge in religion, the other in romantic obsession.
4 ||| Stands with some of the best efforts of Rivette's long career.
4 ||| The everyday moviegoer will find it as impenetrable as its heroine. But if you vibrate to nuances of style, if you enjoy tension gathering strength beneath terrible restraint, if you admire great acting, then you will.
3 ||| Visually arresting period drama finds the core of the emotional life of its characters in the debate between the duchess and the general about love. Balzac fans will delight.
4 ||| Enriquecido ainda por uma direo de arte que ilustra a tristeza do universo de Ben, este  um projeto artisticamente ambicioso que revela sua sensibilidade particularmente atravs de seus belos dilogos.
3 ||| What leads off like a docudrama of the social ills accompanying a misunderstood condition merges into fantasy until, in very clever ways, director Nic Balthazar turns the medium into the message.
3 ||| [Director Balthazar] has made a vivid little film about bullying and cyber-bullying, and done a remarkable job of opening up the head of a silent witness.
3 ||| It's not the overarching naturalism of the performance that stands out but the conceptual breakdown of the portrayal into smaller, loosely connected segments.
3 ||| There's an especially important central theme to this striking teen drama that gives the film a potent urgency.
3 ||| In short, Ben X is a well made, superbly acted drama with an emotionally engaging script and an important message. Recommended.
1 ||| This "issue" movie from Belgian director Nic Balthazar throws a dramatic feint so improbable one can almost see a cartoon question mark floating above the audience's heads.
3 ||| It has its moments of triteness but by and large Ben X is provocative, moving and effective. It's a refreshingly different film that cleverly uses aspects of game culture to tell and intriguing story and confront difficult social problems.
1 ||| The film's moral, technological and psychological themes are glazed over, and the manner in which Ben finally conquers his personal demons is laughably overblown.
3 ||| A provocative, exultant stunner.
3 ||| What distinguishes the book with gripping realism may not be so apparent in the cinematic context. Still, for spy calculus, action, and character realization, I assign you to see it.
3 ||| If you're looking for a high-tech, old-fashioned racist B-western, you've come to the right place, pilgrim.
3 ||| For the most part, this is a pretty solid thriller that combines Government mumble jumble with some pretty exciting action sequences.
3 ||| Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe fire up Ridley Scott's terrific political thriller, which might finally drag audiences to a flick about the War On Terror.
3 ||| As disturbing as it is compelling, Ridley Scott has outdone himself with his first modern-day political thriller, delivering his strongest movie since Black Hawk Down.
3 ||| Body of Lies is most alive while relishing the surveillance and communications tools abused by Hoffman, tools that supply him military intelligence, but not the smarts or scruples to effectively use it.
3 ||| Oscar voters leery of voting for (gasp!) comic book movie, 'The Dark Knight,' for multiple accolades come award season finally have another option with the release of 'Body of Lies.'
3 ||| Body of Lies contains enough you can believe, or almost believe, that you wish so much of it weren't sensationally implausible.
3 ||| Makes the threats, the obstacles and the explosions seem shatteringly real.
3 ||| It's no surprise that Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe are so good in Body of Lies, Ridley Scott's thrilling film about the war on terror, its costs and its frustrations.
4 ||| A tight, first-rate espionage thriller that casts a bleak light on American involvement in the Middle East.
4 ||| 'Body of Lies' is a tense, deftly paced meditation on America's role in the Middle East, and if it's not quite a war movie, it offers somber insights into the Bush administration's campaign against terror that recent thrillers like 'The Kingdom' have not.
4 ||| A palpable tension grinds on you for a bit over two-hours and leaves you as drained as the film's characters.
3 ||| Scott, Crowe and DiCaprio construct a sophisticated, intelligent thriller.
3 ||| Where BODY OF LIES does succeed very well is in demonstrating the multitude of ways in which even very well-thought-out plans to make the world safer can become not only corrupted but can also be hopelessly compromised by other likewise world-safety-minde
4 ||| The result isn't a lecture about American foreign policy, but a smartly updated old-fashioned espionage thriller.
3 ||| Like Blade Runner, the film reminds us of the corrupting nature of power, and how those who look down on others often fail to understand the consequences of their actions.
3 ||| Though Body of Lies hews a bit too closely to convention, it still engages throughout thanks to DiCaprio and director Scott.
4 ||| For those who care about there being more to a thriller than pointless car chases and over-edited fight sequences, Body of Lies offers a satisfying dose of truth.
4 ||| "Body of Lies" is an intelligent geopolitical thriller that ... is really about the manipulation of people like chess pieces on a worldwide board.
3 ||| Say what you want about the guy's early films or performances, DiCaprio is quickly and quietly turning into one of the more fearlessly talented and gifted actors working today.
3 ||| An apocalyptic vision of cloak-and-dagger intelligence, Lies is like a suicide note written by Tom Clancy, but the movie's gloomy inaccessibility actually makes it all the more intriguing.
3 ||| Even if Body of Lies lacks a huge emotional wallop, it dishes plenty of food for thought.
3 ||| On this basic premise builds a complicated story plied with onion layers of perspective and cunning.
3 ||| [Ridley Scott] has few peers at keeping a complex script clear and tightly focused...
3 ||| The movie is an urgent current-events thriller that falls somewhere between Syriana and the Bourne movies.
3 ||| DiCaprio helps turn what could have been a dry-as-sand Middle Eastern thriller into a compelling suspense film that questions the ethics of espionage and counterterrorism without turning sanctimonious or screedlike.
3 ||| Both complicated and compelling, Body of Lies offers an audacious glimpse at the hypocrisy and religious furor fueling a struggle most Americans recognize only as a political catch phrase -- a 'war on terror.'
3 ||| The complex plot is rendered with clarity and precision, the action scenes are very well staged, the suspense is palpable, and the performances are first-rate.
1 ||| I'm not much of a mathematician, but you can say this one is Crowe Scott DiCaprio = Disappointment
4 ||| It's a film directed by one of the best directors in Hollywood, written by one of the best writers and has two of the best actors around. How could you go wrong?
3 ||| Despite a too-long running time, a silly Hollywood ending, and an unconvincing love interest, this is a well-made, high energy, fast-paced film loaded with tension.
4 ||| Body of Lies delivers excellent performances along with realistic action, suspense and drama.
3 ||| Body of Lies is the movie Syriana and The Kingdom wanted to be.
4 ||| Body of Lies may not tell us anything we didn't already know about the way the US does business in the Middle East, but it's compelling nonetheless.
3 ||| It works better as an action-adventure, thanks to Ridley Scott's knack for tightening the screws on the intensity.
3 ||| 'Body of Lies' is an adults-only story about espionage and the politics of war.
3 ||| Ridley Scott delivers an involving if sometimes meandering spy thriller and gets in some choice digs about the paralyzed state of American intelligence in the post-9/11 age.
3 ||| A timely game of cat and mouse that benefits from the performances by its two leads.
3 ||| Body Of Lies lacks the epic sweep of Gladiator and the emotional pull of Thelma And Louise. But it's enormously competent, with a couple of fine supporting performances from Crowe and Strong.
1 ||| But it's something of a penance to sit through, a token handwringing over American dirty tricks that's just another opportunity for Scott and co to blow stuff up.
3 ||| Better than the vast majority of the post-9/11 terrorist yarns, Body of Lies is both more ambiguous and ambitious than such heavy-handed duds as Rendition and Redacted.
3 ||| For those of us who want movies to be about something and not just empty action with minimal shallow 'moral of the story' tacked on, Body of Lies is a disappointment.
3 ||| Passable entertainment -- but definitely not on par with the usual DiCaprio, Crowe, or Ridley Scott output.
3 ||| Visually, the film is quite striking. Few modern filmmakers handle desert landscapes as well as Mr. Scott.
3 ||| ...[Ridley] Scott's most entertaining and involving effort since 2001's Black Hawk Down.
3 ||| Body of Lies is an extremely well paced, tightly wound, and intensely violent thriller. There is no damnation or congratulations here. As Russell Crowe muses as the end: "No one is innocent"
3 ||| A compelling, nail-biting spy thriller.
3 ||| Rises above the mediocrity of its storyline thanks largely to its ensemble cast.
1 ||| Solely predicated on its twist ending.
3 ||| With a storytelling sensibility more common in foreign films than mainstream ones, Passengers is a compact, thought-provoking tale that challenges the viewer while shedding light on one's own life, and how he or she has chosen to lead it.
1 ||| Passengers is a supernatural thriller so mechanically inept and lacking in suspense that it doesn't even pass muster as lowbrow Halloween-ready entertainment.

4 ||| If you're a fan of watching poker on television and inventive comedy than The Grand is an entertaining experience that delivers on its premise.
1 ||| This has lots of TV sitcom stars working very hard to be funny with ludicrous characters. If an actor looks like he's laboring to be funny, he isn't.
3 ||| Even if you know nothing at all about the game, you'd be hard-pressed to find better entertainment for such a modest entry fee.
3 ||| The 'card flick' has usually been a standard western, drama or crime deal -- that is, until a pack of mostly veteran comic actors tried their hand at improvising, Christopher Guest-style, in the highly amusing The Grand.
3 ||| If it never achieves the balance of broad laughs and barbed insights into human frailty of, say, A Mighty Wind, it delivers plenty of sharply funny moments.
1 ||| It's hard to believe that a lineup so stellar could generate so few laughs, but there it is.
1 ||| You eventually get the feeling that the actors are riffing mainly for each other. Their attitude is, 'We're talented, trust us, we know how to be funny,' but in the end, it's mostly just a bluff.
3 ||| There's nothing under the surface of the comedy, although it's rarely less than amusing and frequently hilarious.
1 ||| A collection of sketches does not add up to a drama in this case
3 ||| It's no classic, but, unlike recent attempts at sports comedy (we're looking at you, Semi-Pro), The Hammer comes through by not seeming to try too hard.
3 ||| The Hammer isn't going to sneak past Raging Bull in the boxing-movie pantheon (or even Rocky, for that matter). But like its star, it is an underdog you can root for.
1 ||| Remaking Rocky Balboa as a comedy isn't a half-bad idea; remaking it as a comedy starring Adam Carolla, the dreadfully unfunny former host of Loveline and The Man Show, most certainly is a terrible one.
3 ||| Working with utterly predictable material, screenwriter Kevin Hench finds plenty of offbeat humor, and Carolla knows how to make it sing.
3 ||| I never would have guessed that Adam Carolla, the politically incorrect radio and TV personality, could hold his own in a movie, but here's The Hammer to prove me wrong.
3 ||| Carolla is winning in The Hammer, which evokes Rocky and just about every other lovable-loser sports movie while showing enough comic originality to hold interest throughout.
3 ||| [Adam] Carolla's grumbly, monotoned, stoop-shouldered pessimism in The Hammer, the first feature he has penned, is actually funny.
3 ||| Adam Carrola makes for a pretty agreeable leading man in The Hammer, a movie tailor-made to the comic strengths of the radio/TV personality.
3 ||| It's genuinely funny, oddly romantic and surprisingly engaging for what could easily have been an obnoxious vanity project.
3 ||| Carolla has a tendency to riff when he should be acting, and the whole project is rambling and disorganized. At the same time, though, The Hammer also has dry wit and unforced working-class swagger, and hits some surprising emotional notes.
3 ||| To his credit, Carolla carries 'The Hammer' with self-assured ease, hoisting the film on his broad shoulders while making sure, as screenwriter, to leave some of its sharpest one-liners to his supporting cast.
3 ||| One of the films that should not fly under the radar of sports comedy fans, "The Hammer" is a surprising good time at the movies.
3 ||| It's not "Rocky" and it's not "Caddyshack", but "The Hammer" was a pleasant surprise and is a welcome addition to the all-too-small list of reliable sports comedies.
3 ||| The Hammer could have become a typically sappy sports flick, but [Adam Carolla] filled it with enough of his trademark humor to keep things fresh even with plotting that isn't groundbreaking."
1 ||| 'Shutter' is a movie that's a few years behind its time, maybe even a few decades.
0 ||| A flat, boring, lifeless movie pro-environmental groups ought to protest as a waste of natural resources. Perhaps 20th Century Fox could give some free popcorn to people who buy tickets to their next movie.
1 ||| Another reason not to get the 'Supernatural Package' at the one-hour photo.
1 ||| Its PG-13 rating and basic lack of gore seem designed to be uncontroversial, but of course the result of all this anti-controversy is a really dull film.
3 ||| It's fun to root for the one who says "Boo!" rather than the screaming ciphers for whom we are usually asked to cheer.
1 ||| Asian horror remakes are typically not screened for critics, and Shutter is no exception. The studios know what they have: watered-down, lifeless shells of motion pictures devoid of characters, drama, or anything remotely resembling horror.
3 ||| Ochiai directs with calm assurance -- no eyeball-rattling quick cuts here -- and Dawson's screenplay preserves most of the original script's strengths and fixes a couple of weaknesses.
0 ||| Shutter is a ghost story free of logic and spirit, representative of everything that's wrong with so much of current mainstream studio fare.
1 ||| The main problem is that they spelled the title wrong. The first vowel should be an I.
1 ||| What happens is the same as every other J-horror remake only less so, at least in part because it stars Rachael Taylor and Joshua Jackson instead of actual famous people.
1 ||| The latest in the downward spiral of remakes
1 ||| SHUTTER should have been the scariest horror film since THE RING, but instead it was infuriatingly bad. This joins ONE MISSED CALL in the ranks of worst horror remakes of all-time and I highly recommend skipping this one for the original...
3 ||| It's an effective scary story that depicts women with spirit - on both sides of the divide.
0 ||| Yeah, this movie is a must avoid.
1 ||| paramenei eksisoy, an ohi kai perissotero flyaro ap' tin pigi tis empneysis toy. Apo tin opoia krata episis to megethos ton logikon almaton, oksynontas ta opoy mporei gia na klepsei merikes eykoles fantezi tromares, eno kseperna to prototypo sto epipono t
1 ||| ... the film feels like a made-for-TV movie.
1 ||| Shutter, which attempts to do for cameras what The Ring did for videocassettes, what Pulse did for computers, and what The Grudge did for grudges.
1 ||| The very Thai-specific charms that made the original such an unforeseen, unpredictable delight when I first saw it are almost entirely absent here.
1 ||| The latest in a seemingly endless line of Japanese horror remakes.
1 ||| Drab, eye-rollingly stupid and with noisy effects designed to drown out audience snores, Priest is just about as bad as it gets.
1 ||| The over-optimistic promise of a sequel will hopefully be one premise which remains dead and buried. For ever and ever. Amen.
1 ||| The whole thing -- which in less than an hour-and-a-half manages to insult Catholics, Native Americans, John Wayne fans and anybody with two I.Q. points to spare -- all climaxes in a lot of fire and smoke and CGI explosions.
3 ||| I liked Priest, and I wouldn't much mind any of these characters returning.
1 ||| In the way it unimaginatively regurgitates familiar genre elements in service of preachy piousness, director Scott Charles Stewart's cinema is the equivalent of Christian rock.
1 ||| At $12.75 a movie ticket, you might be better off buying the comic book.
3 ||| It's admirable how a movie with so many obvious influences and references can offer an experience that still feels like its own thing.
1 ||| They could have called this one 'Something Borrowed' because everything feels lifted from other films.
1 ||| Bettany has little character and the 3D effects are appalling.
0 ||| An irritating, lifeless experience, so bad it sucks the fun right out of moviegoing.
1 ||| If you've watched any of the trailers, they make about as much sense as the full feature does.
1 ||| High production values and slick editing can't save this picture. Nor does its overbearing soundtrack music, which tries to strong-arm viewers into believing they're watching a pulse-pounding thriller.
0 ||| A mash-up of vampire horror and period westerns stewed with Blade Runner cityscapes and ridiculous religious images in a bubbling cauldron of dumb ideas and sinfully bad dialogue.
1 ||| In all of this utterly dispiriting, ill-written and spastically-directed tripe, there is one bright spot, and that is Karl Urban as the villain.
1 ||| So bad it's almost good...almost.
3 ||| It may not be great, but it's pure, and it deserved better.
1 ||| The po-faced filmmaking and acting only highlights how unoriginal it is, from production design to music to action sequences
1 ||| You sit in your theater seat imagining how much better it would be if it were rated R and garnished with tons more vampire violence and digital death.
1 ||| It's a lot of talky-talky and very little smashy-smashy.
1 ||| These vampires are bestial-looking, eyeless, fanged somethings that look like...Gollum on crystal meth.
1 ||| A poorly conceived, pointless exercise in genre filmmaking.
1 ||| Priest is the sort of movie you walk into knowing full well its IQ is significantly less than the bucket of popcorn balanced in your lap...
1 ||| ...as dull and intolerable an actioner as one can easily recall...
1 ||| Vampires, cowboys and warrior priests: an unholy mess.
1 ||| Some scenes on the train have a certain chill, but overall this is likely to short-change genre lovers.
1 ||| An ugly exercise in genre filmmaking and religion bashing, Priest marks a new low in the action/horror hybrid, and once again proves why Paul Bettany is the worst action star working today.
1 ||| 90 minutes of inconsequential action and clich recycling...painful to watch a semi-interesting setup get squandered and become stuffed into a familiar-as-hell framework where nothing ever seems at stake.
1 ||| Priest is a lousy action movie with boring characters, a convoluted plot, and, most unforgivable, very little compelling action.
1 ||| The good news is that Priest is not nearly as painful to sit through as Legion. But that's about it for the good news.
1 ||| Priest is one of those films you will forget about approximately five minutes after it's over. There is absolutely nothing memorable here.
3 ||| It's everything you've enjoyed in every genre film you've ever seen rolled into one package, although it seems to lose something when added into the sum of its parts.
3 ||| It's not a stalker flick or a ghost story, although it's sort of a combination of both.
1 ||| Why the evil-doers need to do what they do is never explained. All we get is an atmospheric soundtrack desperately seeking a horror movie.
1 ||| Fleeting pleasures are undermined by an inane, directionless narrative, barely-even-one-dimensional characters and an overall sense of superficiality.
1 ||| The tedium is almost as annoying as the sound effects.
1 ||| The Sneak was left wishing another film would break through the screen.
1 ||| This unbelievably ponderous British chiller keeps priming us for some shocking revelations - oodles of "scary" incidental music, ominous shots of the London skyline - and signally fails to deliver them.
1 ||| The Broken isn't a bad horror film. It's just not a film-it's scary footage that serves no purpose.
3 ||| This film looks good, is capably acted and builds excellent atmosphere. And then it gets lost, and so do we.
3 ||| While the film might not work for fans of today's faster-paced horror/thrillers, The Broken is a creepy little pot boiler that's likely to get under the skin of many horror fans.
3 ||| Those looking for an innovative new take on the prison genre should be pleased with the latest from this talented filmmaker.
4 ||| The Escapist is a film worth seeking out, for both its fresh re-invention of the prison film genre and the absolute clinic on acting put on by Brian Cox and the rest of the actors in the film (not a weak link among them).
3 ||| There's a strong sense of style to this prison-break thriller, + a few strongly sympathetic characters and some nifty twists
3 ||| At last, a British crime movie that's as good as its pitch sounds: Brian Cox trying to break out of prison. Do you need to know any more to want to see it?
3 ||| Director Rupert Wyatt and his co-writer Daniel Hardy have neatly trimmed the fat from this story -- there's almost no character, incident or visual cue that doesn't somehow enhance the plot or set up a surprise or key revelation later on.
3 ||| Cox is a master of understatement, of using his gloomy eyes, his lined face and the intensity of feeling in a simple gaze or gesture to suggest the full measure of a man.
4 ||| A rousing film packed with solid performances and relentless suspense that brilliantly reinvigorates the genre of prison escape thrillers.
3 ||| It's swifter, grittier, and louder than the typical escape movie, but it still falls firmly within the tradition of underground breakouts. Its contrapuntal timelines are twisted into a surprisingly elegant first feature.
3 ||| A fractured, stylish and tense affair built around a band of great performances.
4 ||| Prison drama breaks all the rules - and wins.
3 ||| Rich in texture and colour, music and aura.
3 ||| In a world where too many filmmakers are content to bunt their way onto second base, Sugar swings for the fences, and knocks one out of the park.
4 ||| A deeply felt, personal story, exposing in very specific microcosm the struggle experienced by thousands of immigrants each year.
3 ||| An immigrant's saga more than "a baseball movie," Sugar ultimately runs headlong away from the clichés that mar formula sports-related narrative films.
4 ||| As inspirational as it is heartbreaking, a moving story about pursuing one's dreams and how one can still find a life for oneself even if those dreams don't come to fruition.
4 ||| Boden and Fleck are exceptional talents who refuse to sweeten Sugar for mass consumption. The result is raw and riveting.
3 ||| a movie in search of the yearning for even the smallest American dream
4 ||| How many sports dramas dare to think beyond winning, losing and how you play the game? The narrative thrust of Sugar comes from somewhere less expected.
4 ||| Sugar is an inside-the-park homer.
3 ||| In this carefully observed and impressively minimalist movie, Sugar redefines and refines his art.
4 ||| In its unhurried fashion, Sugar can take its place with the best baseball movies. Where most focus on the grand slam, this one's about the life that surrounds the game and everything that comes after.
3 ||| Scenes that would usually be mere setup ... become engaging in their own right. ... game and practice sequences have an easy authenticity from the start.
4 ||| Some of the surprise of seeing a major new talent appear from thin air is lost in even a strong sophomore effort, but Boden and Fleck have set and met a high standard for their work. I found it sublime.
3 ||| Sugar is a gripping look at the immigrant experience, with small moments as important -- and visually arresting -- as any on the baseball diamond.
3 ||| ...an interesting tale of a young man devoted to his family back home, trying to come to grips with surviving in a completely different culture.
4 ||| They have instead chosen a low-key and realistic approach that is so effective that when I saw the film for the first time, I was convinced for the first 10 minutes or so that I was watching an actual documentary.
4 ||| Easily one of the year's best, Sugar is an intelligent and sublimely moving film that should not be missed.
4 ||| Algenis Perez Soto plays the character so openly, so naturally, that an interesting thing happens: Baseball is only the backdrop, not the subject. This is a wonderful film.
3 ||| An authentic, timely "immigrant experience" tale about trying to score.
3 ||| [A] terrifically human account of a young Dominican pitcher's discomfiting odyssey from his tiny village to a major league training camp to A-ball in the American Midwest.
3 ||| The film's strength is reportorial, sensitively exploring a theme that has grown ever more prominent with the globalization of sport.
3 ||| Sugar is a departure from movies of its kind in quietly observing that life is often a series of base hits rather than grand-slam homers. The film has few moments of high drama and the games played matter only in how they shape Soto's character.
4 ||| Please understand that I am not praising "Sugar" just because some scenes were filmed here in the Quad-Cities.
3 ||| A sports movie that transcends its genre.
4 ||| Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's film is a modest but masterful triumph.
3 ||| Fleck and Boden probably will get better at making movies, but for now, they can get by with this: They are curious about what makes people tick, and they have a talent for making us curious, too.
4 ||| the feeling of it when it's over is exhilaration at time spent with real characters placed in real situations.
4 ||| A terrific film that's not just for sports fans. Written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, it's as insightful as it is entertaining.
3 ||| A penetrating exploration of the hardships that Dominican baseball recruits face in making to the major leagues.
4 ||| Dominican natives pursue their diamond dreams in the U.S.
3 ||| It is a gently persuasive, bittersweet run around the base paths in the game of life.
3 ||| That the movie manages to avoid some of the customary cliches and formulaic machinations of the sports drama genre makes the film rewarding, as do the performances by its mostly fresh-faced cast.
3 ||| This sophomore effort from the writing and directing duo of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck ("Half Nelson") is not your typical sports movie, but rather focuses on the immigrant experience of a foreigner on a work visa to play minor league baseball.
4 ||| Sugar is a baseball movie in the way that Macbeth is a play about kilts. The description is accurate as far as it goes, but it doesn't go nearly far enough.
4 ||| It resists cliche at every turn and puts something solid in its place: raw yet controlled observation that gives the film the form of a flexing muscle.
3 ||| Naturalistic performances, even-handed characterisation and the utter eschewal of genre cliches ensure that this tale of a stranger in a strange land hits home.
4 ||| Sugar is a completely convincing character who inhabits what appears to be an utterly authentic world.
3 ||| Like a slow curve ball, its journey unexpectedly going off course, Boden and Fleck deliver their magnificent take on the American dream by skewing it sideways.
3 ||| What's this? An inspirational sports flick whose every step doesn't lead up to the climactic Big Game in which the underdog hero must score that touchdown/hit that home run/kick that goal/deck that opponent?
3 ||| In 'Sugar', the pair skilfully dismantle the timeworn themes, characters and story patterns of the conventional sports movie and then reassemble them as a rich, socially astute realist drama.
3 ||| As a sports movie the film perhaps lacks the pace and punch to capture the genre's traditional audience. But Sugar is much more than a sports movie. It is a picture of integrity, intelligence and empathy that studiously avoids cliché.
3 ||| Sugar is a revelation, not least in the way it ducks an onrush of cliche to expose the whole rags-to-riches mantra as a bright and shining lie.
3 ||| Sugar, winningly played by the complete newcomer Soto, isn't a cut-out ingenu but a testy, competitive, driven but fallible person. The road he follows is modest, but the film is beautiful and searching in letting him find it for himself.
3 ||| Poignant and beautifully written, directed and performed, Sugar confirms Boden and Fleck as eloquent chroniclers of the underbelly of the American dream.
3 ||| Sugar might look like a typical underdog sports movie on the surface, but over the running time it transforms into something much more interesting.
3 ||| Sugar is a human story told with immense skill, right down to the deft transitions and the soft fuzz of the electronic score.
3 ||| Great cinema can extend our own experience by making us understand how it must feel to be somebody else - and this is, in its gentle and unpretentious way, great cinema.
4 ||| A compelling and compassionate stranger-in-a-strange-land drama, it's a film brimming with insight, integrity and life. I reckon we're looking at one of the films of 2009.
3 ||| Sugar is dazzlingly free of message creep. We are perplexed, yet fully persuaded.
3 ||| This masterfully pitched exercise in sombre revelation may frustrate sports fans looking for an easy hit.
4 ||| Brilliantly directed, superbly written and thoroughly engaging drama that skilfully blends sports movies, immigration dramas and coming of age movies, while avoiding the usual cliches.
4 ||| A powerfully engaging coming-of-age immigration sports documentary-style drama. And this unpredictable genre mash-up is pure magic.
4 ||| ...an immigrant's song, a story about cultural dislocations and human connections that happens to be one of the year's best movies.
3 ||| We're so used to sports movies hitting certain dramatic beats that when "Sugar" completely avoids them, it forces us to sit up and pay attention.
3 ||| Pays such attention to detail ... that it's easy to forget you're watching a work of fiction and not a documentary about a real-life star on the rise.
3 ||| Sugar is a refined and appealing love letter to baseball, and a reminder of all that makes it matter.
3 ||| Full of life, even sexy and at times bouncy (and with a fine score), Sugar is a lovely, moving treat... full of rich supporting characters.
4 ||| Sugar showcases a lovely performance by Soto, a match for the modest, low-key filmmaking style of Boden and Fleck... [Blu-ray]
3 ||| Though a little long at two hours, Sugar is a treat for any serious student of baseball.
3 ||| Sugar makes my top ten list of baseball films. It's not your typical sports film, it's emotionally honest, and it's delightfully detailed, yet subtle.
3 ||| Not your usual film about chasing the American dream, Sugar gains mileage instead from a more sober brand of inspiration while imparting wisdom in the form of welcome reality checks.
4 ||| Steroids enter the equation, but "Sugar's" narrative turns feel more generous than obvious - emphasizing baseball's calming, community ideas over its cult of personality. The gravity of Miguel's plight stays with you, but so does his eventual peace.
4 ||| Follows its own path, defying stereotypes and avoiding just about every sports-movie cliché and fish-out-of-water convention, all the way to the end.
3 ||| Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, the makers of Half Nelson, return with another subtly observed drama about a character on the outskirts of mainstream America.
4 ||| Not only have director-writers Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck crafted a poignant immigrant tale, they've made a sports saga rife with rare truths.
4 ||| It is full of so much humor, grace, and unexpected detail, and arrives in such a truthful place, that in the end it's far more enthralling than the typical rags-to-riches tale one might have anticipated.
4 ||| A rich and moving reminder of the way professional sports aspirations can shape someone's destiny in the real world.
3 ||| Writer-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck could have created a cliché-ridden film...But the pair (who also made the teacher drama Half Nelson), are more concerned with humanism than proving that dreams do come true.
3 ||| Has some pretty insightful things to say about the nature of being "disabled," and it says them with a good deal of humor, style, and understanding.
3 ||| A finely observed, compelling drama with the creepy tinge of a thriller.
3 ||| This warped masochistic cousin to David Cronenberg's Crash - not to be confused with the Oscar winner of the same name -- is well worth seeing for Farmiga's stunning performance.
3 ||| This odd little fugue of a movie would be implausible, even laughable, if it weren't also marvelously played, visually composed and plotted with the utmost cunning.
3 ||| An obscure and terrifying mental disorder leads a reporter to the strangest and then the most terrifying story of his life. A neat film noir in a very modern setting amongst people who are not all there.
3 ||| An outsider adventure strictly for the very open-minded, presenting the numbness of paralysis, ironically, as a potential source of paroxysms of pleasure.
3 ||| By far the movie's strong suit is Farmiga, who gives an astonishingly layered performance,
3 ||| has the best "middle" I've seen in a long time
1 ||| Its biggest mystery is how it was financed (by Texas trillionaire and Dallas Maverick owner Mark Cuban, no less) and selected for distribution.
4 ||| An enthralling, erotically charged drama that marks the terrific debut of a director that is most certainly a talent to watch.
3 ||| A simple tale of how love and affection can sometimes inspire some of the nastiest human emotions imaginable.
3 ||| [Cox] inhabits Avery like a force of nature, drawing the audience to him and eliciting sympathy, even when his acts become morally dubious.
1 ||| The lesson to be taken away from Red is that, after some killin', the only thing that can make someone feel better is a new puppy.
3 ||| What makes this movie worth seeing is the acting, which is superb throughout.
3 ||| As Diesen fades out with a pat, artificially full-circle ending, we still appreciate how Red danced on the edge of the Movie-of-the-Week abyss and, thanks to Cox and the careful tending of Jack Ketchum(TM)s original novel, never fell in.
3 ||| An elegant and deceptively straightforward dramatic thriller.
3 ||| A low-key but compelling thriller that refuses to follow the traditional vengeance movie template.
3 ||| ...a deliberately paced and downright thoughtful piece of work.
3 ||| The hero in Red doesn't want revenge. He wants an apology. This isn't your ordinary vigilante film.
1 ||| To be brutally honest, there are many other things I would rather do with my final days than sit through this clichd mess all over again.
1 ||| Some new directors often opt for minimalism in the hope that less is more. This doesn't work for Amy Redford (Robert's daughter), who transitions from actress to filmmaker with The Guitar.
3 ||| I was seduced by Melody's story. Sucked in, enjoying Amy Redford's film despite myself.
3 ||| Fortunately, the rumourmongers were wrong -- Hillcoat's vision is forthright and brutal.
3 ||| Very moving.
3 ||| The two principals are superb, and the direction is resonant in its very restraint.
3 ||| A journey worth taking.
3 ||| Really pulls you in and sticks with you ... an incredibly strong piece of dramatic storytelling.
3 ||| Based on Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer Prize-winning bestseller, The Road primarily transpires within a bleak, post-apocalyptic United States that's been decimated by an unnamed catastrophe -- with the bulk of the narrative following a father (Viggo Mortense
4 ||| It's hard not to divine that The Road will be receiving near universal acclaim and a truckload of Oscar noms.
4 ||| The Road evokes the images and the characters of Cormac McCarthy's novel. It is powerful, but for me lacks the same core of emotional feeling. I'm not sure this is any fault of the filmmakers.
3 ||| You won't find anything entertaining in The Road but maybe you'll find something else.
1 ||| When a movie is bleak and depressing, it had better be damned good. The Road is damned bad.
3 ||| Despite the carps, a receptiveness to this material will pay off in tension and suspense, pushing you off The Road in a state of emotional exhaustion.
4 ||| One of the most important and moving films to come along in a long time.
3 ||| Hillcoat took it as far as he dared and created a beautiful suffering; a film that somehow manages to be both unwatchable and unmissable at the same time.
3 ||| A heartbreaking and powerful adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.
3 ||| The movie The Road is nowhere close to its literary sire, but it's probably the best one could hope for from a movie version.
3 ||| It's a grueling experience that still allows for the viewer to survive with a self-centering hope. This is no Disney amusement ride.
4 ||| While the film is not as resonant as the novel, it is an honorable adaptation, capturing the essence of the bond between father and son.
1 ||| A post-apocalyptic tale that is nothing more than an ad for patriarchy and dualistic thinking.
3 ||| The picture glimpses what it might really be like if the earth went to hell. As shattering as the sights are, turning away is out of the question.
3 ||| I cannot think of another film this year that has stayed with me, its images of dread and fear -- and yes, perhaps hope -- kicking around like such a terrible dream.
3 ||| delicate and indefinable, with only a thin reed of a story.
4 ||| For those who found the Coen Brothers' adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's No Country for Old Men too lighthearted, John Hillcoat's relentlessly faithful version of the author's post-apocalyptic Pulitzer-winning novel might hit the spot.
3 ||| Oppressively, but appropriately, bleak adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's end-of-the-world novel about a father and son wandering a post-apocalyptic landscape. Points for strong performances from the two leads and the film's unyielding view of the end of day
3 ||| Like McCarthy's book, The Road is dark, bleak and nightmarish but also stirring and beautiful and optimistic: As long as life remains, the movie argues, there is always hope.
4 ||| Mortensen has proven to be one of the best actors in the business, and The Road is his masterpiece.
3 ||| (T)hanks to Hillcoat's reverence to the source material and his desire to visualize McCarthy's mind's eye Armageddon, we wind up with something so harsh it's almost unbearable.
3 ||| This adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's 2006 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is intense and, yes, depressing -- and earns every minute that it rattles inside your head.
3 ||| The Road immerses us so completely in its world that it's as if it is teaching us, as well as the characters, a new way to think.
4 ||| It seems a strange thing to say about one of the most depressing films ever offered as popular entertainment, but The Road is a beautiful movie.
3 ||| My, but it's been a fine year for Armageddon.
4 ||| Mortensen warms the film with his presence, creating a vivid portrait of a bereft man clinging to the one thing he has left.
3 ||| There are still some things that magnificent prose can do that a movie, for all its stars and CGI, just can't. Director John Hillcoat's movie is, however, an admirable attempt.
3 ||| The Road, a tremulous heartbreaker onscreen, has successfully made the leap despite an unthinkable amount of fidelity.
3 ||| The film has pacing issues but it should win an award for casting a brilliant young actor (Smit-McPhee) to carry this heavy drama. He steals the film.
4 ||| Vividly atmospheric direction and performances that are packed with raw honesty.
3 ||| Haunting, ominous and evocative, it's a cautionary, cryptic allegory about the indominable hope for survival, even in the face of unfathomable horror.
3 ||| The Road can be a tough slog, but the journey is a rewarding one.
4 ||| Breathtaking in the totality of its harrowing vision, The Road is an unflinching contemplation on the astonishing duality of the human animal.
3 ||| This is a dramatic, slow moving Mad Max with a kid along for the awful ride. It's a survival tale, and The Road should be seen for those who want to keep carrying the fire.
3 ||| By only allowing us a peek at the characters' interior lives before we're forced to move on down that eternal Road is to deny this fascinating piece its full power. An emotional highway robbery, if you will.
4 ||| Movies like '2012' wreck the world in front of our eyes through long pageants of explosions. 'The Road,' however, deals with cataclysmic ruin in a far different and much more compelling manner.
4 ||| A nerve-wracking and emotional experience...as true to the book as it could have been without having narration the whole way through.
4 ||| In this haunting portrait of America as no country for old men or young, Hillcoat -- through the artistry of Mortensen and Smit-McPhee -- carries the fire of our shared humanity and lets it burn bright and true.
4 ||| How could anything so bleak be so promising?
4 ||| It's fitting that The Road opens at Thanksgiving. It will thrill you, unsettle you, but mostly remind you that even in the darkest of times there is much to be thankful for.
4 ||| Carved almost verbatim from Cormac McCarthy's compelling novel, The Road is a depressing, gut-wrenching journey that is strangely uplifting at its core.
3 ||| One of the grimmest end-of-the-world movies in recent memory.
3 ||| It's a beautiful, harrowing story and a good film. I'm just worried it's not good enough considering its potential.
3 ||| This film is worth seeing for the performances from Mortensen and gifted adolescent actor Smit-McPhee.
4 ||| A powerful and devastating adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel.
3 ||| The end of civilization in The Road is ugly and terrifying, but that makes the father and son's hope and faith so much stronger.
4 ||| The muffled air, the rumbling tectonic murmurs, the groaning and incessant tree deaths, sounds of other humans, all these sounds sell the monochromatic but still stunning images of a completely dying world
3 ||| Like its protagonists, the movie is implacable and unyielding, and may very well break you down.
4 ||| Grim beyond belief and almost beyond endurance, 'The Road' is one of the most depressing "apocalypse" movies ever made.
3 ||| The concussive soundscape rumbles like thunder in the distance. And the film's episodic terseness is the poetry of cataclysm, in a language that needs no translation.
3 ||| Obviously, it's not really a pleasant cinematic experience, despite the quality of its filmmaking and performances. It's worthwhile for its character development and its examination of morality and survival behavior, though.
3 ||| A very fine film that somehow manages to attain only a fraction of the heart-rending power of its grim source.
3 ||| Mortensen comes through with another haunting performance that mixes the cerebral with the physical.
3 ||| The Road is a heavy load to bare for the casual movie fan. Unless of course, that movie fan likes drinking with the lights off, full-moon Russian Roulette or confuses the Sunday funnies with the obituaries.
3 ||| The Road... literalizes but doesn't flinch. It is brave in the dumb way brutes sometimes seem to be, as though it knows no alternative.
3 ||| An overall impressive adaptation that, while tough to recommend because of its oppressive mood, stays on the right path for the duration of its run.
4 ||| Grueling Road Worth Traveling.
3 ||| A long and winding, dark and depressing road but at the end strangely uplifting. The acting is excellent.
3 ||| One of the most chillingly effective visions of the world's end ever put on screen - and a heart-rending study of parenthood, to boot.
4 ||| Haunting, harrowing yet profoundly enriching. The Road is the most powerful and moving post-apocalyptic film of the twenty-first century.
4 ||| A Trojan-horse blockbuster that promises the wham bam of apocalypse while actually delivering the quiet pain of human intimacy, The Road might just be one of the most heartfelt end-of-the-world movies yet made.
3 ||| The Road isn't flawless, it isn't quite the emotional masterpiece you want it to be, but it is both a worthy companion piece to the source material and, moreover, a dramatic slice of cinematic story telling in its own right.
3 ||| Hillcoat's raw and sparing approach is sympathetic to the novel. Even after it's over, it continues to burn.
3 ||| This is a superlative piece of film-making. Terse, raw and unadorned, there are no cheap tricks to devalue a story of unconditional love.
3 ||| Ultimately, this bracingly austere film falls a little short of the greatness of the book, but it's still a terrifyingly effective warning that we squander the planet's resources at our peril.
4 ||| What might be the feelbad film of the year makes an early but convincing claim to be the film of 2010.
3 ||| An unforgettable love story, an absorbing road movie, a searing examination of people pushed to the very limits and an ultimately uplifting celebration of the human spirit.
4 ||| One of the best films this year (and last!). Bleak, painful, charged with emotion and philosophical questions about how far we have evolved from animals when our comforts are taken away. A must see.
4 ||| A powerful, thought-provoking and frequently uncomfortable drama, but it's also one of the best films of the year.
3 ||| It's almost-but-not-quite as good as the 2006 classic post-disaster film Children Of Men - and that's good enough for me.
3 ||| It's one of that rare breed of remarkable films - like Mel Gibson's Apocalypto - that, once you've seen it, you would be quite happy never to see again. Then again, it's so good you won't need to.
4 ||| Fans of No Country For Old Men may find the film insufficiently quirky (do not expect humour, not even the darkest kind), the decimated world created is wholly compelling and a submersive experience.
3 ||| The film is so beautiful. In this sort of stark, austere grim way it's incredibly beautiful.
3 ||| Despite the challenges of the book they have come up with a compelling film.
4 ||| It calls on all of one's powers of emotional endurance but it rewards the brave. It is relentless but beautiful, harrowing but tender.
3 ||| It's the end of the world as we know it and you won't feel fine, even though The Road is fine filmmaking.
3 ||| This expertly crafted "road movie" does provide, thanks to the director's brave commitment to realism, a poetic and intentionally devastating emotional viewing experience.
4 ||| A bleak, depressing odyssey you can firmly admire and marvel at, even as it rips your heart out.
3 ||| Hillcoat wisely uses a low-key combination of location footage and CGIs to create a sad industrial wasteland that is more reminiscent of Tarkovsky's Stalker than Mad Max.
3 ||| A soulful and savagely beautiful meditation on the end of the world, Australian director John Hillcoat adapts Cormac McCarthy's tale of despair and faith with great delicacy and care.
4 ||| Avoiding all the pit falls of the bleak genre, The Road is captivating and in the end inspiring, and though not a film for everyone, a great film for any who enjoy thoughtful, artful cinema.
3 ||| Um filme difícil e angustiante. (...) Mas, talvez mais surpreendente, representa uma experiência profundamente tocante.
3 ||| Shames most films with the audacity to consider themselves tearjerkers.
4 ||| ...only half as traumatic as the Cormac McCarthy novel on which it's based - which of course means that it will still leave you a wreck.
4 ||| Without watering down Cormac McCarthy's hangman prose, John Hillcoat's adaptation transcended sad, gray apocalypse tropes to become an unexpectedly uplifting parable about faith, kindness and family at world's end.
3 ||| Una película agobiante, notablemente realizada y narrada. Tan dura y desoladora como el futuro posible que describe.
3 ||| Hillcoat does his best, and for the most part, he succeeds. The horrifically desolate landscape and the drab greys and cobalt blues of the scarred sky pervade every shot.
4 ||| The Road is a highly emotional, involving, palm-sweatingly tense movie that will scar you for life if you let it. Exhausting to watch but oddly exhilirating to experience, it's a film you'll watch once but will never forget.
3 ||| Hillcoat and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe have successfully recreated the barren, grey, burnt out landscape... Mortensen is admirable as the man journeying with his son and it's bleak in a way that Hollywood rarely dares to be.
3 ||| One of the more interesting films to come out in 2009.
4 ||| The Road may appear - at face value at least - to be a muted, subdued and frankly rather quiet approximation of an Apocalypse. But it's precisely this that gives it so much power.
3 ||| The opposite of escapist entertainment, this rugged and wearing screen experience is tough, uncompromising stuff.
3 ||| Somehow I am captivated by what I see in 'The Road', John Hillcoat's post-apocalyptic drama adapted from Cormac McCarthy's work. [Full review in Spanish]
1 ||| This is a stupid, lazy, dully designed and messily executed piece of junk that will have little kids and parents alike squirming in their seats out of sheer boredom.
3 ||| Parents already in dread of taking their children to this 3-D kids' movie by uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer will find much to appreciate, though G-Force is lots of fun all around.
1 ||| Its prime directive is to inculcate young viewers with the gee-whiz tropes of producer Jerry Bruckheimer's teen-oriented fare.
0 ||| The worst Walt Disney Pictures release in a decade. To describe this chaotic, charmless, pop culture-centric product as completely and utterly excruciating is almost too kind a criticism.
3 ||| It's more fun than it should be.
3 ||| G-Force is everything I wished a Disney film could have been in the 1970s. What's so wrong about getting all giddy about it as a kid in my 30s?
3 ||| G-Force is bright and funny, but surprisingly, it's more of an adventure film than a comedy.
3 ||| The rodents carry the picture off in their little furry paws and this one is sure to entertain youngsters -- no matter how you look at it.
1 ||| G-Force is painfully bad and completely unfunny.
1 ||| G-Force is being shown in both 2-D and digital 3-D formats. I saw it in 2-D, and that's the preferred format because it's one less dimension for the movie to suck in.
1 ||| Imagine ordering a Diet Coke only to be handed a formula on a piece of paper and you have some idea of what watching G-Force is like.
3 ||| Hugely enjoyable, fast-paced action-adventure with a witty script, likeable characters, great action sequences and terrific special effects.
3 ||| This rollicking action romp has all of the chase scenes and car crashes you expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer movie
1 ||| A bland distraction for the school holidays and nothing more, the now-ubiquitous 3D version isn't any better.
1 ||| The maestro of mayhem, Jerry Bruckheimer, does a kids movie.
1 ||| 1 Plexiglas ball sporting 1 hamster was fine for Disney's Bolt. Along comes Bruckheimer -- now it's 3 Plexiglas balls with 4 hamsters, er, guinea pigs, and 1 Transformer. Seems he's hell bent on excess.
1 ||| Obtain a human-sized version of a hamster wheel, then spend a couple of hours scurrying around inside it, and you'll have had an experience far more varied and stimulating than what's on offer here.
1 ||| Disney [hates you and] wants your money.
1 ||| The worst thing about G-Force isn't that the plot is so formulaic that the entire movie can be divined from the first 20 minutes or that it's not particularly funny.
1 ||| Sometimes those aren't choc-covered sultanas in your hand after all, and G-Force is one of those times.
1 ||| click for full review
1 ||| ...an utterly worthless (and frequently unwatchable) piece of work.
1 ||| Several fellow G-Force sufferers likened the 3-D-rendered inanity to Idiocracy's Ass: The Movie. But that's an insult to a good backside.
0 ||| Everything, from the writing to the score to the irritatingly plain cinematography is as generic as it gets.
1 ||| Features a stellar cast, but it's never clear why because none of the vocal work is remotely demanding.
1 ||| The result is B-grade cheese. The only genuine mystery, for me, is why such a fine cast signed on for such a witless movie.
1 ||| A manipulative bore of a film. Liam Neeson is better than this and so are you.
3 ||| Has riveting parallels with much more recent British royal family history. It's also an entertaining, emotional drama.
3 ||| Ralph Fiennes steals it as the dour duke in a splendid under-performance. His "Please put Her Grace's hair out" when his wife's wig catches alight at a party is perfectly done.
3 ||| The Duchess is an emotionally engaging drama with a terrific central performance from Keira Knightley. Recommended.
3 ||| He has tried to make Georgiana's quest for independence - her attempt to gain power via the media and the Whigs - just as gritty. Against the odds, he mostly succeeds.
3 ||| Can we not just enjoy what's on the screen without being spoon-fed a specious modern analogy? Dibb and his team - especial plaudits to Michael Carlin's production design and Michael O'Connor's costumes - have worked honourably to persuade us that we can.
3 ||| He's also helped enormously by a mature, restrained portrayal from Knightley, a masterclass in passive aggression from Fiennes and a performance of tender seduction from Atwell.
3 ||| For Knightley the part fits like a corset - it's an enigmatic, free-spirited turn and a role she'll be remembered for, probably her best role to date in a film not directed by Joe Wright.
1 ||| Knightley does the best she can to enliven such thin Masterpiece Theatre material, but eventually, the sheer emptiness of the pageantry wears her -- and us -- out.
3 ||| satisfies those seeking not only a gorgeous period piece, but a meaty slice of royal history
3 ||| It's Knightley who makes The Duchess a royal treat.
4 ||| This riveting, beautifully acted and directed film ranks with the best I've seen this year to date.
3 ||| [Knightley] breathes real life into the role of Georgiana Cavendish, an 18th century aristocrat with striking parallels to another, more modern, British notable.
3 ||| A worthwhile addition to a genre that's been driven into the ground by weaker filmmakers who know where to rent the costumes, but don't understand the importance of storytelling.
3 ||| A great life, and its depiction produces a treasury of costuming and hairdressing flair to hide the relationship and drama within drawing room walls.
3 ||| It's a gorgeous production that boasts a beautiful leading lady, handsome locations (nicely captured by cinematographer Gyula Pados), drop-dead costume design and the standard-issue tropes of a PG-13 rated bodice ripper.
3 ||| Fiennes and Knightley are exceptional in their roles and Dibb proves himself ably in his first big-budget flick.
3 ||| Thanks to Fiennes, we come to understand the enigmatic duke as the immovable object deeply perplexed at having to contend with the unstoppable force that is his wife. It is a quietly complex performance almost beyond words.
3 ||| Human desire hasn't changed much in 300 years, it would seem.
3 ||| With its seductive period settings, glorious costumes and the stellar pairing of Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes, it is difficult to see how The Duchess could fail to stir significant interest.
3 ||| The filmmakers hope we see parallels with Georgiana and the life of Princess Diana, who somehow found a way to channel her pain into good. And they are there, to be sure.
3 ||| While I much liked The Duchess, this portrait feels unfinished.
4 ||| The Duchess is a handsome historical film, impeccably mounted, gowned, wigged and feathered.
3 ||| Fiennes, an actor who disappears into roles like ice in a teacup, makes the Duke a complex and almost sympathetic figure, a bulky, unappealing man whose interests are in all the wrong things.
3 ||| Beguiling.
3 ||| Knightley doesn't carry the film, which wouldn't work without Ralph Fiennes' perfectly calibrated performance.
3 ||| It isn't just eye candy; there's an active intelligence behind this design.
3 ||| It's easy to joke about Knightley's fondness for period dramas. But we shouldn't underestimate her ability to channel the historic and modern into one compelling figure -- or her grasp of the power of dress-up to free performance.
3 ||| A mature, restrained portrayal from Knightley, a masterclass in passive aggression from Fiennes and a performance of tender seduction from Atwell.
3 ||| A handsome costume drama that highlights the relationship between the Cinderella outfits and the restrictive privilege of the society from whence they came.
3 ||| Keira Knightley is really splendid...
4 ||| The Duchess is an intelligent and compelling period drama that offers a critical examination of the lot of women and the abuses of men in a time when such behavior was standard and acceptable.
1 ||| (U)nless you are a spinster sans a recognizable love life, or someone with little previous knowledge of the genre, everything here will seem rote, baroque, and exceedingly dull.
3 ||| [Knightley's] credible performance is definitely one of the best things about this handsome looking-but-inconsistent biographical drama.
3 ||| The Duchess is clearly Knightley's movie, ultimately rising or falling on her performance. She's up to the task, capturing both the charm and grace that made Georgiana so captivating.
4 ||| Hums with the rhythms of some of the better Merchant Ivory films.
3 ||| You'll spend a lot of time in The Duchess wondering if the film has a point.
3 ||| It's a beautiful period piece that will send you to a bookstore for a better account of the dirt and vice at its core.
3 ||| A visually sumptuous, emotionally lacerating melodrama.
3 ||| The Duchess is largely successful because it manages to offer those degrees of humanity and romance (if not blandness) amidst the rest of its potent, bodice-ripping drama.
4 ||| Knightley turns in a performance that impresses us with the strength of her character even as we're appalled by the system that produced it.
3 ||| ...a slightly too serious period costume drama
3 ||| Intelligently written, superbly acted, beautiful to look at and happily free of anachronisms.
3 ||| If you love stories with powdered wigs and scandal, you won't want to miss "The Duchess."
3 ||| A film of elegance, wit and some power that's just a bit too compromised by its rather soapy underpinnings.
3 ||| It chronicles the saga of a vibrant and forward-thinking woman hampered by the constraints of a rigid society.
4 ||| Knightley shines in this tale of grace under pressure.
3 ||| With striking parallels to the life of her direct descendant, Princess Diana, this stunning film of the tortured love life of Duchess Georgiana Spencer is a triumph for its star, Keira Knightley.
3 ||| Hands Keira Knightley another plum leading role and serves as yet another example of how Ralph Fiennes' brooding brand of acting can be successfully employed for all manner of characters.
3 ||| Deserves credit for playing things straight %u2013 complete with its moral quagmire and inherent sadness. The performances of Knightley, Fiennes and Atwell really make it work.
3 ||| Ignore the details and focus on the big picture. In a year when everybody's focused on the role of women in politics, the life of the Whig trailblazer Georgiana offers plenty of food for thought.
3 ||| Knightley shines, taking Georgiana from carefree teen to ignored wife then motherhood in a hugely sensitive and honest portrayal. The outfits are stunning, their scale extraordinary, the attention to detail first class; with fashions changing as she does.
3 ||| Dibb never overwhelms the emotions with overwrought speeches or gaudy costumes, or boggs them down with unnecessary soap opera histrionics.
1 ||| Thankfully, the last 20 minutes of the movie are not a total waste, but I doubt many will stick around long enough to enjoy them
3 ||| Even though English completely changed Luce's intent from savage satire to 'celebrating women,' and it's far too long, it has a terrific performance by Mendes and some funny lines.
1 ||| No cliché, no matter how it screams and pleads for mercy, makes it out of this baby untapped.
1 ||| Is it an exaggeration to call The Women the worst movie of the year? Well, yeah, probably. But it may be the most disappointing, given all the effort that went into it.
1 ||| It's hard to say what's sadder, that The Women's intended audience had to wait 14 years for a film like this or that that long wait has been almost for naught.
1 ||| A big-name cast of actresses gives it a go, but everyone from Meg Ryan as the cheated-on wife to Eva Mendes as the home-wrecking perfume girl struggles with a script that resists being crowbarred into the 21st century.
1 ||| Diane English's abysmal remake of George Cukor's 1939 femme classic will have fans of the original growing claws.
1 ||| A costly and bemusing disaster. Dull is too kind a word.
0 ||| Good performances and stylish direction can't disguise what The Women really is: a throwback to a simpler time when women were simple and everyone was happy about it
0 ||| This remake feels more like a Sex and the City knockoff than a reinvention of Cukor's classic.
1 ||| In 1939, it [dialogue] was hip and maybe even scandalous...That type of talk and the behavior of these characters crossed the oldie-moldy line somewhere in the early 1970s.
1 ||| How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways...
1 ||| A mess.
1 ||| A total disaster.
1 ||| It's not every movie that makes you wish Vin Diesel would run in and start blowing up stuff.
1 ||| Instead of smart, subtle and snappy, writer/director Diane English goes for the big, loud and brassy.
1 ||| Abandon hope, all ye who enter here: Strange casting and a lousy script make The Women the sort of film that's pure torture to sit through.
1 ||| It hurts especially to watch Ms. Bening and Candice Bergen (who plays Mary's mother) lend their wit and dignity to a project that has so little of its own.
3 ||| What a pleasure this movie is, showcasing actresses I've admired for a long time, all at the top of their form.
0 ||| This is girl power? I'll not have what she's having, thank you very much, and I'm thinking about amassing a small army of my own to demand as much.
1 ||| Reinterpreting a 1939 film through a modern day lens -- how's the fit? Like a size ten foot squeezing into a size 4 Manolo slingback, it limps. Painfully.
1 ||| A ghastly Sex And The City knock-off guaranteed to make its chick-flick audience storm angrily out in search of the next Rambo movie.
1 ||| It's so flat and unfunny it makes Sex and the City sound like Billy Wilder.
4 ||| Call it Sex and the City with brains.
1 ||| Trite and boring portrait of rich and self-absorbed women.
1 ||| It seems like cinematic sacrilege to compare Diane English's disappointing contemporary drivel with George Cukor's still-hilarious 1939 original.
1 ||| As dull and maddening as a bad dose of PMT.
1 ||| This can't be what women want to watch. A film written, directed and starring all women completely misses the mark of embracing strong powerful independent women.
1 ||| The most disappointing aspect of The Women is how few laughs it delivers.
3 ||| "The Women" is a grand old dame that shrugs off time as easily as signing a credit card receipt.
3 ||| If you don't take it seriously -- and I don't think it's meant to be taken seriously -- there is enjoyment to be had from these contemporary women.

1 ||| This is the movie Diane English fought to get made the last 15 years?
4 ||| It's refreshing to see some grown-up mainstream filmmaking during the summer months. The film shows you can have star-driven action films that also deliver an emotional and visceral punch in the heart of blockbuster season.
4 ||| The film kicks you in the balls with awesomeness, but is smart enough not to turn back and keep kicking you until you forget you're being kicked.
3 ||| Awesome, action-packed and enthralling...
4 ||| A sumptuously designed and minutely detailed work that manages to remain compelling despite its essential familiarity while featuring top-notch contributions from everyone on both sides of the camera.
4 ||| Public Enemies is Heat with fedoras, a gangster epic that is easily the best thing Mann has done in more than a decade, an intensely visceral tour-de-force.
1 ||| A dull and lifeless gangster movie that immediately disappears from the mind.
3 ||| There is a lot to discuss concerning Public Enemies ... but the elephant in the theater is that the movie looks like crud.
3 ||| Michael Mann's Public Enemies is a grave and beautiful work of art.
4 ||| This film deserves to be seen by as wide an audience as possible, though. It certainly features terrific performances by the cast, especially the leads.
3 ||| As technically flawless a film as we've come to expect from a master filmmaker like Michael Mann, but handled far more clinically than some might expect considering the subject matter and the summer release.
3 ||| Though it provides no insight into its subject, Michael Mann's John Dillinger biopic is still an engrossing period piece, thanks largely to the director's sure hand and signature style.
4 ||| It's movie dynamite.
3 ||| Anyone doubting the role "charisma" plays in the movies need look no further than Public Enemies, an old fashioned gangster picture built on simple star power.
4 ||| Michael Mann's extraordinary Public Enemies is an unusual sort of gangster picture, a near-impressionistic recreation of the last year in the life of one of American history's most notorious bank robbers.
3 ||| Mann may believe he is pushing the edge with his newfound affection for digital, but Public Enemies is really old fashioned filmmaking.
4 ||| Depp operates like a star in more ways than one: He holds everyone in place with his gravitational pull.
3 ||| Is there any role Johnny Depp cannot make his own?
3 ||| Something about Dillinger's bloody, summary death has always nagged at the public; Mann is clearly urging today's audiences to draw its own conclusions.
3 ||| Mann knows exactly how to pace this kind of movie, set to a veritable symphony of gunshots, and Public Enemies feels both wonderfully populated and beautifully controlled.
4 ||| Here is a film that shrugs off the way we depend on myth to sentimentalize our outlaws.
3 ||| Public Enemies is a good movie -- sometimes very good -- that could have been a great one.
3 ||| Public Enemies isn't quite a summer blockbuster -- but it's got more brains and guts than almost anything else playing out there, and stands as a fascinating movie to think about over the 4th of July.
3 ||| It's a fascinating bundle of contradictions--authentic in a million details, deeply romanticized in others. Cool, calm and collected, this is more love story than gangster picture.
3 ||| The screenplay's layers reveal themselves gradually, the film having a documentary like verisimilitude that is at times absolutely electric.
3 ||| The film is not great, but it is very good in most respects, and a few isolated moments achieve greatness.
3 ||| The movie tangentially holds your interest, but could have been so much better if it had developed a rooting interest for one side or the other.
3 ||| While Michael Mann's Public Enemies is very good, it's missing the spark that could have pushed it to "great."
4 ||| It's no "Heat." For skirting the lawman's story, call it "Warmth." Still, it bulks up, with Midwestern muscle, from a violent version of "The Aviator" into Mann's "Gangs of New York" - unwieldy and imperfect, but compelling, exciting and thoughtful.
3 ||| Despite some minor strikes and overlooking a yawn of a performance by Christian Bale, Public Enemies indeed stars two decisive characters among 2009's best so far: Johnny Depp and the meticulously recreated environment that is Chicago itself.
3 ||| For people who loved Heat, this is a tour de force.
3 ||| Michael Mann shows some restraint and comes up big with this one.
4 ||| "Public Enemies" knows the language of the gangster movie so well, and yet director Michael Mann has taken it and created something exciting and new out of it.
3 ||| A Michael Mann movie is a Michael Mann movie, and fans will not be disappointed.
3 ||| Although Public Enemies does not ascend to the heights of Bonnie and Clyde or The Untouchables, it is nevertheless an effective depiction of the final months of the life of one of the United States' most infamous criminals.
3 ||| Michael Mann's sharp-looking movie is a worthy vehicle for Depp, even if it doesn't break any new ground in the well-worn gangster genre.
3 ||| This account is true as far as it goes. It just doesn't go far enough.
3 ||| With Public Enemies, he has made an impressive film of great formal skill, one that inescapably has a brooding dark-night-of-the-soul quality about it.
3 ||| Director Michael Mann has taken the story of John Dillinger, and has made from it a drama full of dread and atmosphere, a 140-minute film that in no way seems long, that's a succession of compelling scenes, with no dead wood.
4 ||| Public Enemies is as elegant and muscular a film as one could hope for in a summer of flash and noise. Which is not to say director Michael Mann's gangster saga lacks flash and simmer.
3 ||| While Public Enemies is a well made, well acted, well written film, it's one without a spark at the center to make it truly special.
3 ||| Amid the summer season of spectacle and silliness, Public Enemies appears as an oasis of adult entertainment.
3 ||| Depp is playing off a marvelous foil in Marion Cotillard.
3 ||| It might sound damning to say that the film resembles a bullet-riddled carcass just barely clinging to life, but it's exactly this ephemeral sensation, which Mann sustains for the entire two hours +, that distinguishes Public Enemies.
3 ||| Mann and co-screenwriters Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman faithfully adapt the Dillinger portion of Bryan Burrough's absorbing 2004 book by the same name, using the same locations where famous breakouts and shootouts occurred.
1 ||| Could be a battle of wits and wills. Instead, it's a battle to stay awake.
3 ||| Director Michael Mann mounts a technically proficient, visually enthralling crime drama anchored by the low-key but captivating performance of Johnny Depp as legendary bank robber John Dillinger.
3 ||| True-crime story or romantic myth-making? This was the question I brought in to Michael Mann's Public Enemies...and, though seemingly an either-or proposition, the question still on my mind when I walked out.
1 ||| The movie ends with a line of dialogue so startlingly inane that it leaves the picture flapping on the screen like a punctured balloon. It may be the most brutal moment in the whole movie.
4 ||| This is the purest of American narratives, and this, indeed, is one of our finest storytellers.
3 ||| Public Enemies is a good film but considering the talent working on it, it is not unfair to say that it really should have been a better film.
3 ||| As always, no one does a bank heist quite like Mann, but as one of the most under-rated director's from the West, very few can tell a story as rich and complete as him either.
3 ||| This is swooning male anti-hero worship.
3 ||| Public Enemies is a delicious feast for an interpretive viewer.
4 ||| Public Enemies is, at its core, a fascinating portrait of criminal narcissism.
3 ||| Even if specific elements disappoint, the movie as a whole lingers in your head long after the credits roll.
3 ||| The story of the visually curious Michael Mann film Public Enemies has been told before in movies more exciting but rarely more thoughtful than this one.
3 ||| ... as strange and exhilarating as riding the running board of John Dillinger's fast, shiny, black getaway car.
3 ||| This is a hugely enjoyable, impressively directed thriller with a great ensemble cast and powerful performances by Johnny Depp, Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard.
3 ||| Michael Mann's Public Enemies is epic filmmaking with B-movie content. It's as if a wannabe David Lean got down and dirty Americana-style.
4 ||| Mann's best film since Heat is arguably the best movie anyone's made since Heat.
3 ||| This superstar crime thriller emerges as something surprising, fascinating and technically dazzling. Don't expect a Hollywood movie. Expect a Michael Mann movie.
4 ||| Whilst there is a lot of gun action and violent set pieces in this, it's really a piece that is really all about the characters and it hands down the best gangster movie of the last decade... at least. One of this year's few must see movies.
1 ||| Mann dedicates himself to making Dillinger look cool, and that's the problem with the whole movie. It looks the business, but has no depth, nothing to say, no new angle. It just feels like a homage to older, better films.
3 ||| What Michael Mann has achieved with the new Public Enemies is to capture some of the raw energy and allure of the old gangster B-films.
4 ||| Here is a film alive in a way we've not perceived before: a breathtakingly new visual experience, a precision-choreographed action thriller, and a classically minded piece of American art.
4 ||| Shot in pin-sharp high-definition, this is one amazing-looking movie, where even the most ordinary scenes crackle with energy and suspense. As with Heat, Mann's made not just the crime drama of the year, but possibly of the decade too.
4 ||| An on-the-spot, VIP ushering into the gangster movie hall of fame. It's a real movie, one which you'll be proud to say you paid to see. Eat that, Optimus.
4 ||| Mann approaches this film almost like poetry, using fine camerawork and editing to focus on internal emotions
3 ||| The hottest gangster movie in ages.
4 ||| Public Enemies isn't my No. 1 of the year, but it's close. Even more powerful than Depp is the way Mann controls this film's look and feel.
4 ||| The great theme of 'Public Enemies' is the inevitability and finality of death.
3 ||| Some sloppy storytelling prevents Public Enemies from reaching greatness anyway, but what hampers the movie is Mann's decision to shoot in high definition video. The movie just looks cheap.
3 ||| A strangely distant, quasi-demythification of the tale of John Dillinger that keeps threatening to turn into a truly fine movie without ever quite pulling it off.
3 ||| Though faithful to Bryan Burrough's painstakingly researched book, Michael Mann's 'Public Enemies' offers more an abstract impression of Dillinger than a fully satisfying portrait.
4 ||| Mann draws a sprawling cast together with a myriad of period details that give an authentic sheen, without letting the audience get confused in the sea of historic information.
3 ||| a cool and calculated throwback to the romanticized heyday of gangster films
4 ||| John Dillinger was a violent man who died a violent death.In 'Public Enemies,' we learn the story of how he evaded the FBI %u2013 even escaping from prison - to become a nationally known bank robber and Public Enemy No. 1.
3 ||| Sure, Public Enemies can still boast Mann's crisp HD aesthetics and stylistic cool but the showdown between Dillinger and Purvis lack ... well ... Heat.
3 ||| Evoca o embate de personalidades (e de diferentes lados da Lei) visto em outras obras do cineasta.
3 ||| There's a lot to admire, but it's not up to the standard of Mann's, or Depp's, best work.
4 ||| Over 140 minutes that genuinely fly by, Mann crafts a highly atmospheric and emotion-charged movie experience that is sure to be remembered as a touchstone release of 2009.
3 ||| Best of all, Mann and his cast achieve a grim atmosphere of fatal inevitability as the net slowly tightens around Dillinger and his free-wheeling criminal cohorts.
3 ||| Depp and Bale as Dillinger and the FBI agent tracking him are excellent and the film is a consistently entertaining, thoughtful and high paced ride, that Dillinger actually did the more extraordinary actions portrayed is the only way their inclusion in a
3 ||| Like Dillinger, Mann and his jangly camera live for the moment. If Public Enemies doesn't cut it as history or mythologising, it succeeds staggeringly well as a series of set pieces.
4 ||| A triumph of pure cinema, Public Enemies is one of the most visually experimental films of Mann's career.
3 ||| The popular reaction to what the defiant anti-hero came to represent in depression-era America made it almost criminal to call him one.
3 ||| Michael Mann, director of Public Enemies has capped an extremely impressive decade of work with a movie that approaches greatness but just misses.
3 ||| Public Enemies is a thoroughly detailed and engaging crime epic, which traces the criminal exploits and pursuit of infamous gangster, John Dillinger.
3 ||| Lawmen and outlaws collide in Mann's stylish, brutal drama.
3 ||| A seasoned genre filmmaker at the height of his game; still able to turn even one of his lesser works into something classy and gripping.
3 ||| The lush sets and gorgeous costumes coupled with the grainy cinematography make for a totally immersive experience, pulling a modern audience into a bygone era of fast cars, tommy guns and femme fatales.
4 ||| [A] beautifully crafted action movie that has brains, brawn and beauty in equal measure. Simply, stunning.
4 ||| It is easily one of 2009's most satisfying action dramas for adults.
3 ||| Following his most even-handed exploration of male-female sexual conflict in Woman on the Beach, Hong Sang-soo hurtles full-bore into the subjectivity of the horny man with Night and Day.
4 ||| An intriguing look at a hedonist in the midst of a midlife crisis, a creep whose dalliances and denial slowly catch up with him.
3 ||| It is no easier to warm to Zonca's film than to its central character - but it is impossible to take your eyes off either. Amoral, at times brutal, and full of surprises...
3 ||| Plot twists and supporting characters all play second fiddle to her portrayal of a woman who's as fascinating as she is morally bankrupt.
3 ||| Julia, by and large, is a tale of desperate opportunists, fugitive souls who survive by living on their wits, taking risks and making it up as they go along. It sometimes feels that a similar person is behind the camera as well as in front of it.
3 ||| Gripping, tense and often wildly unpredictable thriller, superbly directed by Erick Zonca and featuring a ferocious central performance from Tilda Swinton.
3 ||| Julia is at once a marvel of screen acting, an unthinkably black comedy, and one of the few truly nail-biting suspense films to emerge this decade.
4 ||| Zonca's story is an unruly beast, lurching this way and that like a biker hopped up on mescaline and paint thinner, its unpredictable rowdiness in sync with its out-of-control protagonist.
3 ||| Will be remembered for the unforgettable performance by Swinton that drives this inventive thriller.
3 ||| [Tilda Swinton] is on screen for nearly every second of this two-and-a-quarter-hour-+ film and it's a startling star turn indeed.
3 ||| Like any beautiful, heartbreaking wreck -- we can never take our eyes off Julia. Or the fierce and uncompromising actress bringing her to awful, astonishing life.
1 ||| A bungled thriller that starts out badly and never recovers.
4 ||| Zonca's Julia is a difficult movie to stomach, but entirely worth the emotional unrest it puts through you.
3 ||| a tonally-consistent, lively thriller that is very much of the filmmaker's own little corner of the world
3 ||| Swinton is mesmerising as a messed-up drunk.
4 ||| A nerve-wracking thriller with a twisty plot and startling realism.
3 ||| In a sense, it goes to all the places a sensitive character study might have gone, but more dramatically, convincingly and vividly.
4 ||| Charles Bukowski would have loved this foul-mouthed, fiery, reckless woman. Against all odds and common sense, you will, too.
3 ||| Tilda Swinton is electrifying in this riveting, knock-your-socks-off crime thriller that is just about as intense as movies get.
3 ||| In Erick Zonca's tense and juicy noir, Tilda Swinton plays the title role with a crusty panache matched only by her matted, flaming-red thatch of hair (a character in its own right).
1 ||| One should hope Tilda Swinton has a good dental plan - it will come in handy when the time comes to pry out the scenery she aggressively chomps.
3 ||| Tilda Swinton's strong central performance saves an otherwise routine drug drama.
4 ||| Swinton approaches Julia with an all-or-nothing attitude, creating an ungodly eccentric character and evoking an impressive array of audience emotions.
3 ||| Risky, genuine, and alive.
4 ||| With its stunning Flagstaff, Arizona locations and a breezy tone, the John Wayne-produced "Angel and the Badman" is a delightful mix of romance and action, with excellent chemistry between the leads.
4 ||| Angel Heart is a thriller and a horror movie, but most of all it's an exuberant exercise in style, in which Parker and his actors have fun taking it to the limit.
4 ||| Alan Parker's pulp sensibilities are beautifully honed by this razor-sharp piece of occult noir.
4 ||| One of the few truly great modern horror films
3 ||| Erotic, twisty and incredibly disturbed. Splendid!
4 ||| Este excepcional noir conta com maravilhosa fotografia, edio primorosa, roteiro envolvente e - o mais importante - uma atuao genial de Rourke, digna de Marlon Brando.
3 ||| An underappreciated thriller with a sizzling Lisa Bonet to boot!
3 ||| Seriously creepy bayou noir with more twists than you can shake a chicken bone at.
4 ||| [This genre] is especially satisfying for me because it mixes menace from two sources. There is no femme more fatale than Mr. Scratch. There is no noir darker than the promise of the pits of hell.
3 ||| Angel Heart is a stylish, arresting, and beautifully sculpted thriller.
0 ||| So wretched that it should be unceremoniously put down.
1 ||| At least Luis Guzman and Dax Shepard were smart enough to avoid being credited for their roles in it.
3 ||| ...the family comedy of the season.
1 ||| There's something in the way that Old Dogs is brazenly, proudly lazy that makes it truly reprehensible
0 ||| It is an irredeemable affair.
0 ||| If Old Dogs isn't the absolute worst movie either star has appeared in, it's close enough to count.
0 ||| There are some experiences no one should be subjected to even in the name of science. It may be that forced viewing of this film has been outlawed by the Geneva Convention.
1 ||| In the first scene, we find out that Williams-Bot does not feel comfortable around children, because he kicks a soccer ball at a child and breaks the child's nose! This is very funny.
1 ||| Does no one know how to film physical comedy anymore?
1 ||| Director Walt Becker's film goes for humor and heart, achieving neither.
0 ||| A great opportunity to gather family members you clearly think are stupid.
1 ||| This imbecilic, mean-spirited farce, which sneers at adults, leaves you wondering: where are the Three Stooges when we really need them?
0 ||| This excruciating comedy tests the limits of how many shots to the crotch a movie can show, or an audience can absorb.
1 ||| Incredibly dull and generic.
1 ||| A slack, sagging 88 minutes still feels rushed, with what must have been scenes trimmed down to micro-blip montages, and a final scene playing out over the credits; it feels like even the people making Old Dogs wanted to be done with it.
1 ||| We have reached a point in our moviegoing life where the two most horrifying words a studio can mutter are "Robin" and "Williams."
1 ||| Old Dogs does to the screen what old dogs do to the carpet. It's unfortunate that only the latter can be taken out and shot.
0 ||| Unfunny and uninspired, this dog deserves to be put down.
0 ||| Director Walt Becker can't even pull off hits to the groin (you know they're coming in a movie like this) with as much panache as an episode of America's Funniest Home Videos.
1 ||| The ploy of pairing John Travolta and Robin Williams, whose salaries probably represented most of the budget, is the only pedigree Old Dogs has going for it.
1 ||| The timing of the comic set-ups is consistently amateurish, as if scenes were edited with hedge clippers, with the actors mugging frantically, waiting for the take to end.
1 ||| Painful.
0 ||| Director Becker treats the comedy in Old Dogs the same as if he were treating a case of mange: Apply two gags, rub in liberally, and call in the morning with the box-office totals. Aarf.
1 ||| Old Dogs seems to have lingered in post-production while editors struggled desperately to inject laugh cues. It obviously knows no one will find it funny without being ordered to.
1 ||| A painfully unfunny attempt at comedy filled with lazy, juvenile, forced humor that's an insult to everyone's intelligence.
1 ||| a strong cast fighting a script that is labored, stale, and obvious
1 ||| Might be best just to let these sleeping Old Dogs lie. This incredibly loony comedy sort of demeans everyone involved.
1 ||| Like rancid leftovers, this bland, contrived comedy is a toxic turkey, a buddy/family film gone wrong.
0 ||| Old Dogs is beyond saving. The only humane thing to do is to put it down.
1 ||| Based on the quality of its script, 'Old Dogs' should have been put to sleep before the cameras started rolling.
1 ||| Let's hope that kills any chance for another film of this ilk, probably called Cool Frogs or something horrid like that.
0 ||| Here's a Thanksgiving turkey that was rancid as soon as the idea was cooked up.
0 ||| Why do once great actors attach themselves to a dog of a picture like this? Surely they still have standards? Alas, their judgment seems to be fading . . .
1 ||| The dearth of laughs in this unspeakably awful comedy borders on embarrassing at times.
0 ||| Old Dogs is -- quite simply -- the nadir of filmmaking.
0 ||| Getting your uvula pierced would be less painful than watching Old Dogs.
1 ||| The movie is never remotely funny, but it excels at being creepy.
1 ||| A Travolta family effort for laughs through blatant illogic and human behavior that has no link to the real thing.
1 ||| It's a two-ton nuclear warhead of aggressive lameness, a hard, pounding rain of flop sweat and triteness and depression.
1 ||| Utterly abysmal, entirely laugh-free and hideously embarrassing.
1 ||| The pickings are slim going on invisible.
1 ||| Most repellent is the undercurrent of homophobia, the brutal cultural stereotyping and the fact that Travolta looks like a man wearing a slightly melted rubber John Travolta Hallowe'en mask.
1 ||| This is easily the worst film of the year so far, and frankly last year too. It is embarrassingly, painfully unfunny.
1 ||| This is imbecilic hooey of the rarest breed.
1 ||| Which is better, a soulless life of work and striving for money, or a joyous embrace of family and kids in all their gorgeous life-affirming messiness?
0 ||| Being a film critic is a wonderful job, but there are weeks when the bad film delirium strikes and we'd all be better off in straitjackets.
1 ||| Both Williams and Travolta mug furiously and the kids need locking up.
1 ||| You've never experienced horror until you've seen Robin Williams in a Speedo getting a spray tan.
1 ||| A slapdash embarrassment of feeble age gags and cultural stereotypes, Old Dogs is at once crass, corny, amateurish, insulting, uninspired, deeply phoney and extraordinarily unfunny.
1 ||| It's perhaps wise to avoid this movie at all costs.
1 ||| Old Dogs is a milestone in the [Travolta's] career, the moment when he trumped Battlefield Earth to make the worst film of his life.
0 ||| At the screening I attended I didn't hear one person laugh, though I did hear plenty of involuntary sighs and groans, some of them emanating from myself.
1 ||| Dumb and painfully unfunny.
1 ||| A trip to the vets is needed, to have this dog of a movie, quietly put down.
1 ||| It's aggressively awful, and manages to push its worst gags so numbingly off the scale that we're left slack-jawed in disbelief
1 ||| Um embarao para todos os envolvidos - inclusive o pblico.
0 ||| John Travolta and Robin Williams are no strangers to shamelessness. But not even they can walk away from "Old Dogs" with a shred of dignity - a mean-spirited, insulting "family" film that essentially pees down its leg and calls it comedy.
0 ||| A cringe-worthy crude comedy that has more bark than bite.
3 ||| a surprisingly strong entry into the ever-shrinking arena of serious sci-fi.
1 ||| Imagine "Gamer" without the lucid plot and the designer nihilism but with the inscrutable storyline, nonexistent direction and somnambulant performances and you have this film in all its hacky non-glory.
3 ||| Director Jonathan Mostow makes the proceedings such fun that you're willing to forfeit the smart satire this might have been for the trashy adventure flick that it is.
1 ||| By mixing a detective story and futuristic robots the filmmakers were likely aiming for the next Blade Runner. They wound up with the next Battlefield Earth.
1 ||| If robots had to make a movie without human help, Surrogates is what they might come up with. All the parts are visible, but there's no soul to be found.
3 ||| Surrogates leaves you wanting more, but is entertaining for the short run time.
1 ||| Bruce Willis has little to do but hit his predictable marks and mouth the generic dialogue.
3 ||| An attractive slice of glossy dystopian sci-fi shenanigans from the team behind Terminator 3 sees Bruce Willis reprising the one-cop-against-the-system role that he could by now play in his sleep. Or even via a remote controlled robotic surrogate.
3 ||| Surrogates nudges the robo-thriller in an interesting direction.
3 ||| Surrogates bleakly satirizes our increasingly plugged-in world.
4 ||| The beauty of Surrogates lies not so much in the somewhat conventional thriller plot, though it is efficiently crafted and keeps the audience guessing up to the end.
3 ||| Whatever the reason, Surrogates was shielded from the eyes of critics before its opening, and that's a shame. Because, whatever its flaws, it is a good movie.
1 ||| If you didn't know any better, you'd swear that both the cast and crew of Surrogates were trying to make the worst movie possible.
1 ||| A failure of speculative fiction, of plot, and of good old fashioned action filmmaking.
3 ||| This play between the plastic and the organic asks if perfect safety is worth sitting in the womb of virtual reality for the rest of your life.
4 ||| An efficient, engaging B-movie parable that grapples with technology, civil liberties, terrorism, freewill and religious subtext all in 89 minutes. It's also a true rarity: A good movie in which usually bald Bruce Willis sports a full head of hair.
3 ||| fun entertainment and definitely worth seeing for fans of science-fiction/high concept films.
3 ||| I would have liked to explore this world more and not keep slamming into some convoluted scheme that defeats its own purpose. I had fun watching it, but I actually thought the movie was smarter than its plot.
3 ||| Sure, it's made capably, in a technical sense. But it's banal, utterly predictable and often quite stupid.
3 ||| A smart little genre outing, an endangered species in modern Hollywood. [Blu-ray]
1 ||| I wish I had a surrogate to watch it for me.
3 ||| Ultimately, Surrogates isn't going to break any records, but it's the kind of movie I'd stop at while channel surfing and watch the whole thing on a Saturday afternoon.
3 ||| I predict that when this film is released, lots of critics who miss the point will complain about its muted tone. Scott and Reilly actually underplay the comedy to great effect.
4 ||| A fantastic little comedy, filled with all sorts of weird moments, funny quips, colorful characters, and strange diversions.
4 ||| The Promotion, beyond what's a deeper screenplay than some may give it credit for, is consistently funny in a build-up-and-release way that, much like The Weather Man, supplements those one-liners with uncomfortable behavior and a comedy of manners.
1 ||| Saying The Promotion's tone is all wrong would imply that it had a tone to begin with.
3 ||| Mature satire has unexpected brains and heart.
3 ||| Not that there aren't some great laughs, but this is far from the laugh-a-minute yuck-fest some might expect.
1 ||| If you think latent racism is just plain hysterical.
4 ||| This notable, Chicago-filmed comedy was inspired by the true events of director Steve Conrad seeing a store employee at a Chicago chain armed only with a yellow courtesy vest break up some unruly loiterers in the parking lot.
3 ||| A smart, understated comedy about two assistant supermarket managers making a bid for the one big promotion they both desperately need.
0 ||| Easily the worst movie I've seen so far this year.
4 ||| Fueled by a sense of economic desperation that's all too familiar, The Promotion may wind up being the funniest, timeliest comedy of 2008.
3 ||| better than the usual in so many ways
1 ||| A nasty-hearted little film, and in absolutely the worst way for a film to be nasty: it is absolutely convinced of its own warm spirit.
3 ||| The Promotion uses the structure of a workplace comedy to pose gentle moral and ethical questions about treating people right (or wrong), about honor and ambition, truth-telling and back-stabbing.
3 ||| As a subtle expression of masculine angst, it's the timid flipside of Fight Club. As a gentle critique of the American dream's descent into empty consumerism, it's a less cutesy, less feminist Little Miss Sunshine.
1 ||| The Promotion tries for the dry, low-key vibe of Election, but its humor is not so much dry as evaporated.
3 ||| Reilly and Scott richly mine their characters, alternately confiding in and undermining each other. Their vulnerability and yearning for the good life is a quiet but powerful statement that will stay with you long after the closing credits.
3 ||| bills itself as a comedy, and elements of it do fall into that category, but at its core, this is an incisive and often merciless deconstruction of the American Dream
1 ||| Fizzles as a comedy and as an exploration of the stresses of work.
3 ||| The Promotion works as a comedy because, in the depths of our dark hearts, we enjoy seeing the woes that beset our comic antagonists.
3 ||| ...sharp and intelligent...
3 ||| By taking the time to make that connection with the audience, The Promotion ensures we'll forgive these guys anything -- and laugh along with them -- in their quest to advance their lots.
3 ||| A nice little comedy about what it takes to climb the corporate ladder and the toll such actions take on the psyche of a decent individual.
4 ||| A bit Alexander Payne social satire, a bit Mike Judge's "Office Space," "The Promotion" keeps the laughter mostly low-key while addressing deflating truths about occupational angst -writer/director Steve Conrad's sturdy thematic stock-in-trade.
1 ||| If there's something praiseworthy about Notorious, it's that it pulls off the remarkable, ignominious feat of making its deceased subject less likeable than one remembers.
3 ||| In the first surprise of this short year, this little movie about a big rapper is a worthy testament to the man who would be B.I.G, and the first truly good Hip Hop biopic.
3 ||| Kicks off with the usual rapper braggadocio of a childhood on the cutthroat street corners, then slyly cuts to a chubby A-student nerd known as "Chrissy-poo" to mom Voletta.
1 ||| Notorious delivers nothing but clumsy filmmaking and a greatest-hits checklist, without offering insight into the man or his myth. If you don't know now...you still won't know.
4 ||| An evocative recreation of a decade-past (!) time in music whose creative, cultural, and social influences continue to resonate in the landscape today.
1 ||| We may never find out who killed Tupac and Biggie, but whoever made this movie could be guilty of assassinating their memories and character
1 ||| ignores what Biggie was, a great artist who believed in the power of storytelling, and transforms him into the flawed saint that he never was and, more importantly, never wanted to be
3 ||| The rare music biopic that leaves you not just humming the songs but thinking about life and death, the strategy of fame, and the business of the business.
4 ||| Notorious is a good film in many ways, but its best achievement is the casting of Jamal Woolard, a rapper named Gravy, in the title role.
3 ||| Biggie is played well by newcomer Jamal Woolard, who not only looks the part but has the moves of a slick street rapper down.
3 ||| When it comes to the outsized character at its center, Notorious is the rich, complicated and affectionate tribute he deserves.
3 ||| The film might have been just another middling musical biopic had the lead role not been so perfectly cast.
3 ||| George Tillman Jr.'s film may follow the well-worn path of many a musical biography. But spot-on casting, a light touch around the edges and affection for its subject makes this warts-and-all look at the big man with the big hits a winner.
3 ||| Closer to Scorsese than Scarface, Notorious gives a heartfelt yet clear-eyed sendoff to the late Brooklyn rapper Christopher Wallace, aka Biggie Smalls aka the Notorious B.I.G.
3 ||| It's unlikely there will be a better dramatization of the Biggie Smalls story than this one.
3 ||| Notorious has a fine time along the way, with Woolard channeling the rapper's sweetness and wit as comfortably as his pathos.
3 ||| The performances and the passion fueling this film are astounding.
3 ||| A vivid biopic of the larger-than-life rap star that doesn't require you be a big fan of the genre.
3 ||| If you give this fictionalized film biography a try, you may find yourself caught up in his troubled and complicated rise to prominence -- like me.
3 ||| [Director Tillman has] imbued Biggie's story with emotions that bring home the full arc of a tumultuous, complicated life. That's why you don't have to love hip-hop to be glad you've seen Notorious.
3 ||| Although one may question how objective it is, considering it's produced by Wallace's mother and Sean "P. Diddy" Combs, 'Notorious' is explosive, fun and entertaining.
3 ||| I can honestly see people hating this film but for fans of Biggie's music like myself, the film is a great memorial to one of the best rappers ever.
4 ||| A relentlessly-unapologetic immorality play about a bona fide ghetto gangsta' apt to entertain even Joe Six-Pack to the extent Middle America is inclined to buy into the Hip-Hop Generation's mantra, 'Don't hate the playa, hate the game.'
4 ||| Notorious is a well-made, compelling, and ultimately humane film, even if you don't like rap music.
3 ||| It's always interesting to watch real life unfold.
3 ||| Even though it brings little that's new or innovative to the table, "Notorious" is a must for anyone even moderately interested in the history of hip-hop in the 1990s.
1 ||| As mainstream hip hop becomes ever more predictable, so do the biopics about its stars.
3 ||| Jamal Woolard is an inspired piece of casting in the title role, not disguising sweetness behind the macho and arrogant gangsta facade.
0 ||| This is Hollywood hagiography at its most patronising and preposterous - a product, as well as a celebration, of a diseased, materialistic culture.
3 ||| A swaggering delve into the life of the biggest of all rappers.
1 ||| You've heard of laundering money? Well, this film biography of rapper Notorious B.I.G. has all the earmarks of--not monetary but morality cleansing.
1 ||| Absent the actual music, Notorious would be a lot worse.
3 ||| Woolard also performs much of the film's music.
1 ||| A combination road movie, musical excursion, and comedy is marred by the tedious bickering of the two lead characters.
1 ||| The plot outline for Soul Men could fit comfortably on a single note card, with room left over for a grocery list and a few phone numbers.
3 ||| (Mac) uses his comedic talents to the best of his ability, leaving a lasting impression for the audience to cherish and take home with them.
1 ||| This is not just one of the worst movies of the year (which it would have been whether Mac and Hayes were still alive or not) but one of the most depressing movie-related experiences that I can recall having in a long time.
0 ||| If the Weinsteins had any soul themselves they would take this film and bury it along with every other film they seem to these days instead of trying to cash it in as some misbegotten tribute to Bernie Mac's legacy.
1 ||| The only laugh in this demeaning film filled with vulgar language is unintended; the amateurish scene trying to hide the fact that neither Jackson nor Mac can dance.
3 ||| No one could accuse Soul Men of originality -- it cribs liberally from countless buddy films and road movies -- but it offers enough energy and humor to overcome its shortcomings.
4 ||| There are moments of comedic fire that justify the presence of the two stars in the film, and us in the theater.
3 ||| You want a good time? Soul Men will provide it. You want to say goodbye to Bernie Mac? He wants to say goodbye to you.
3 ||| Soul Men is a raucous send-off for the late Bernie Mac, a gleefully profane take on the road-trip movie that earns its R rating early and often.
1 ||| what else would you expect from the director that gave us this February's pinnacle of cinema tripe, Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins?
1 ||| In spite of its title, the film has precious little soul, but its real offense is being Mac's final on screen credit.
3 ||| 'Soul Men' is not only a tribute to Mac and Hayes, but the film is also funny, often outrageously crude, and pleasurable.
3 ||| This isn't the perfect buddy flick, but "Soul Men" is a perfectly acceptable tribute to the late Bernie Mack, a talented comedian/actor who died too soon.
3 ||| Mostly, the film works, due largely to the bickering, grumpy-old-men dynamic between the two leads.
1 ||| The filmmakers chose to go too often to the well, I mean the toilet, for inspiration.
3 ||| Are there two other actors who are able to utter the word 'motherf**ker' with such forceful comic authority? I think not.
3 ||| for riffing so expertly on classic horror flicks, and for plumbing the depths of horror in the relentless perkiness of "Tomorrow" from the musical Annie, it deserves a medal
4 ||| With nearly non-stop laughs from an amazing cast, an excellently written, thoroughly surprising story line with images you never thought you'd see in an animated feature before and top notch animation, there is no way you can lose.
3 ||| Director Tony Leondis and screenwriter Chris McKennna have mined everything from Young Frankenstein to Sleepy Hollow to Japanese anime to the German Neo-Expressionists to create that rare thing, a cartoon for adults.
1 ||| A Frankensteinian mishmash of parts, with drawings that are derived from Tim Burton grafted onto a script filled with Shrek-style sarcasm.
3 ||| What a strange little movie is "Igor!"
1 ||| This animated underdog tale needs more time in the lab.
1 ||| Igor's leaden plotting, miscast voiceovers and tasteless one-liners are likely to leave every member of the family wishing this creation had never been born.
1 ||| It's fatally split between catering for children who won't understand most of the references, and adults who will find it garish and relentlessly noisy.
1 ||| This dark-toned animation borrows its style from Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride without adding much of its own to the macabre mayhem.
1 ||| Like most acts of cruel mediocrity committed in the name of entertaining children, Igor presumably seemed like a good idea at the time.
4 ||| I look forward to making it part of my regular Halloween movie viewing for many years to come.
3 ||| fabulous
1 ||| The Matador suffers from a very predictable, almost staged quality when capturing Fandila's unsequined life outside the ring.
3 ||| One of the more comprehensive looks at bullfighting we've seen in this country.
1 ||| Mostly The Matador romanticizes a brutal tradition that has no place in the 21st century.
3 ||| Stripping away centuries of civilization, The Matador confronts something primal in human nature, daring us to do the same.
3 ||| [The filmmakers] capture the paradox of beauty and cruelty that charges their entire film. The Matador is rightly exciting -- and unsettling.
3 ||| If you don't mind a lot of smutty gags mixed with a strange concoction of wit, warmth, and (yes) melodrama, I'm betting you'll become a fan of The Auteur.
1 ||| There's a vaguely appealing elegance to the way the film moves -- that is, when the actors stop spouting laughably portentous dialogue long enough for one to appreciate the film's pacing.
1 ||| Director Richard Leder was lucky enough to land actors of the caliber of Oscar-nominees Elliot Gould and Frank Langella only to squander their collective talents in service of a tedious yawner.
1 ||| IF Frank Langella hadn't received an Oscar nomination for "Frost/Nixon," it's pretty doubtful that an opaque oddity like Richard Ledes' The Caller would have managed even a one-week vanity booking at the Quad.
1 ||| A corporate crime drama that runs fatally amok.
3 ||| Here's a quiet lion..read on->
4 ||| The movie is alternately brutal and affecting, filled with big dreams and crushing realities.
3 ||| A moving portrait of the arduous journey taken by poverty-stricken people from Central America through Mexico with their sights set on the United States.
3 ||| There is bitter and breathtaking truth in the story and in the story-telling.
4 ||| That this is Fukunaga's first film is astonishing, given its sharp script, technical proficiency and suspenseful pacing. The ensemble cast is top-notch.
3 ||| Mashes up the tale of the arduous journey across borders with the developing world gangster drama, offering a fresh and convincing spin on both.
3 ||| A tense, awfully depressing companion piece to last year's great Wendy and Lucy when seen as a search for opportunity where there isn't any.
4 ||| Sin Nombre isn't easy to watch, it's raw as a punch to the gut and just as brutal, but it's also a truly beautiful film, full of wonderful performances and brilliant, articulate direction.
3 ||| There are some brief minutes when the tension drops and the story starts to sag, but Fukunaga almost always fills the frame with something worth seeing, and the story has a built-in suspense.
3 ||| Their rapport never felt false to me, didn't come across like a convenient plot device allowing the director to take things from A to B, both Gaitan and Flores digging into their character's very souls.
3 ||| Fukunaga (who was raised in Oakland, California lives in Brooklyn) uses natural-looking locations and non-professional actors like a pro.
3 ||| The caressing, honeyed light in Sin Nombre beautifies and softens every ugly moment in this equivocating story about geographic and moral border crossings.
3 ||| A variation on the theme of Central American gangster films, "Nombre" adds a mystery thriller note in the tone of early American "gangster on the run" films that makes it riveting to watch while telling a heartbreaking story.
3 ||| One of the best movies I've seen in a long time - Director Cary Joji Fukunaga has a promising future.
3 ||| It is a movie about the wages of sin that come back to claim their own, indifferent to redemption, especially a redemption bathed in blood.
4 ||| The thrilling and beautifully crafted debut feature of 31-year-old Californian Cary Joji Fukunaga.
3 ||| Fukunaga does show a certain flair for filmmaking style that suggests that he will one day direct a great movie--unfortunately, despite what you may have heard, this film isn't it.
4 ||| It contains risk, violence, a little romance, even fleeting moments of humor, but most of all, it sees what danger and heartbreak are involved. It is riveting from start to finish.
3 ||| It won't disappoint you. That's rare, don't you think?
4 ||| Among the film's many revelations is a cast of talented unknowns who stand to become much better known in years to come -- which makes the 'no name' title seem almost ironic.
4 ||| More substantive than the average thriller/road movie.
3 ||| Fukunaga seems more capable than most at setting up truly intimate moments; whether it's canoodling in bed or a warm exchange of a burrito between strangers. And it all happens on the decks of one of cinema's most enduring symbols.
4 ||| Tragic and gripping, Cary Fukunaga's Sin Nombre revitalizes a gang-warfare genre that had appeared to be played out lately.
4 ||| [Director] Fukunaga's startlingly impressive first feature is almost ruthless in its depiction of the brutality and degradation confronting the hidden hordes that cross rivers and hop trains trying to get to the United States.
4 ||| Rich details make the immigration thriller Sin Nombre vivid and haunting.
4 ||| It gives a caravan of migrants human faces, compelling motivations and dramatic challenges that transcend borders.
3 ||| Above all, Fukunaga has great respect for his characters and their story.
3 ||| You might think you know where these characters are going, and how the various plot threads will be tied up. But you'd be wrong.
4 ||| The film's beauty, which is meant to suggest the dreams of the characters, is another crucial aspect of Sin Nombre's complexity.
3 ||| Sin Nombre marks an impressive feature-film debut for Cary Joji Fukunaga, albeit more as a director than a writer.
4 ||| Sayra and her family are the poor, huddled masses our founders were talking about, and it's painfully bracing to watch them crushed beneath the promise of a stocked cupboard and living wage.
3 ||| Imagine City of God without the zippy camerawork or Slumdog Millionaire without the millionaire and you get the feel of Sin Nombre.
3 ||| This sense of equilibrium even carries over to Fukunaga's crafty integration of professional and nonpro actors.
4 ||| It's a documentary-style look at the harrowing journey illegal immigrants take to get into this country, but it's also a tightly plotted thriller.
3 ||| The actors, particularly Flores, have a documentary reality about them. Their reactions to most of their predicaments, even the ones given away too easily by the script, are real in the most human sense.
3 ||| I only wish Fukunaga was as good a writer as he is a director -- but as this is his debut feature, I'll cut some slack on that score.
3 ||| [Director Fukunaga] spends as little time dwelling on the whole as possible, instead opting for a classic road-trip story of the parts: the people who are emigrating and the gang members trying to kill one of them.
3 ||| While this Mexican import is treading familiar territory, first time writer/director Cary Fukunaga comes at it with fresh eyes.
4 ||| What makes it unique among films that cover similar subject matter is the restrained acting and richness of its visual sense.
3 ||| This is a very fine film debut.
3 ||| The movie, which has both bloody violence and tender romance, will remind you of "City of God" meets "Under the Same Moon." It is another shining example of the best that independent filmmaking has to offer, much like last year's "Frozen River."
3 ||| This is a vivid portrait of the landscape of the Americas, picking apart every step of the migrant's journey
3 ||| Sin Nombre is a spry, humane account of the hardships encountered on the Mexican immigration trail, whose violence never feels exploitative, for all that it may be hard to watch. Highly recommended.
3 ||| It's a tough watch. It's also one of the best films of the year.
3 ||| It's the scenes of immigrants heading north atop moving trains which resonate the most - a testament to Adriano Goldman's brilliant, expansive cinematography.
3 ||| The rules of the gang are spurious enough to make us realise that this isn't a world of good against evil, it's a world of adolescents who've got no reason to grow up.
4 ||| The film will linger in the mind long after its devastating conclusion. You leave the cinema breathless and disquieted but also with a sense of having had something important revealed to you. In a very strong field, this is the year's best film so far.
3 ||| A hard-hitting tragi-masterpiece that jolts from tender sentimentality to gritty real-life violence .
3 ||| Sin Nombre is a riveting watch and an expertly directed drama that will stay with you long after you leave the cinema.
3 ||| Gorgeously shot and edited, and performed with a gentle emotional openness, this gritty odyssey tells a deeply personal story while examining much bigger issues in Central America and beyond.
3 ||| It's such an accomplished and powerful piece of storytelling that Sin Nombre - which means Nameless - could easily find itself in the running for the Best Foreign Film Academy Award.
4 ||| An epic and stunningly shot thriller about two young people crossing the gauntlet of Central America in their attempt to get to the USA.
4 ||| Spellbinding and nailbiting at the same time, "Sin Nombre?s" climax chillingly evokes the fable of the rabbit crossing the river on the crocodile?s back. Even amid such fleeting hope, its bone-deep fragility proved impossible to shake.
3 ||| It's a drama, a romance and a thriller, but make no mistake - Sin Nombre pulls no punches in delivery a raw, powerful film that shrugs aside genre convention.
4 ||| If you want to learn about the nameless people behind the headlines, Sin Nombre is the best place to start.
4 ||| Eloquent, elegant and utterly heartbreaking, Sin Nombre is one of the most exciting pieces of cinema we've seen in a long time.
3 ||| Despite the fact that its premise sounds like it was dreamed up by a pervert who depends on that date rape drug for a social life, this macabre molestation mystery proves to be easy to swallow.
1 ||| A meandering, self-indulgent rumination on old age, death and unfulfillable desire, German actor-director Vadim Glowna's adaptation of Yasunari Kawabata's surreal, ironic short story gets everything but the surrealism and irony right.
1 ||| a turgid porn fantasy tale for depressed old men
3 ||| Sure, there's copious full-frontal female nudity and an aroused male body part, but such scenes are a means to an end, not an end in themselves. There's a subtle difference, but still a difference.
1 ||| Not even the august presence of Maximilian Schell can dispel the odor of fusty smut that clings to House of the Sleeping Beauties.
1 ||| Do you find this premise anything but repugnant? It offends not only civilized members of both sexes, but even dirty old men, dramatizing as it does their dirtiness and oldness.
1 ||| What we're offered is a succession of lifeless scenes punctuated by pratfalls that only a handful of kids in the audience found funny. Next.
3 ||| The film never tries too hard to be cool, features adorable rodents in fetching knitwear, and includes helium-voiced chipmunks shaking their tushes as they cover Beyonce songs. Just great.
1 ||| The world's most irritatingly high-pitched rodents are back and noisier than ever, in this lobotomised rip-off of the High School Musical franchise.
1 ||| With an unengaging plot, flat jokes and shameless product placement, Alvin is a late contender for worst film of the year.
1 ||| Three digimated rodents play guitar, go to school and create merry hell, all for the benefit of the "holiday season" audiences that made the original Chipmunks movie a "global phenomenon" to the tune of 350m. That's not phenomenal - that's criminal.
1 ||| There are plenty of lame pop-culture references to Apocalypse Now and Taxi Driver, should any losing-the-will-to-live parents need a final push over the edge.
0 ||| Surely this qualifies as cruelty to humans.
1 ||| Despite its success as a babysitter for preschoolers, it's a not a very good film.
0 ||| [It] could be the most aggressively terrible movie of the year.
1 ||| Instead of paying for celebrity voices that are rendered unrecognizable, why not pay for better writers?
0 ||| The story is so paper-thin one surmises it was scrawled on soggy toilet paper somewhere
1 ||| Whatever slim charms there were in the nostalgic, musically cute and slapstick-friendly first film of chipmunk mania are squished right out of The Squeakquel like so much rodent roadkill.
1 ||| "Alvin & the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel" is pure cinematic poison from start to finish and does roughly for holiday moviegoing what Irving Mainway's Bag O'Glass once did for holiday gift-giving.
1 ||| The slapstick required of everyone, animals or not, will exhaust even parents who remember the Chipmunks' original hits.
3 ||| Harmless, diverting and forgivably silly fun that will delight kids while keeping adults awake and, for the most part, amused.
1 ||| a half-assed, low-budget enterprise trading on children's endless appetite for talking animals
3 ||| Kids will love this movie and %u2014 as history teaches %u2014 they love the chipmunks. It's fast-paced, has plenty of music, a really funny fart joke and a happy-ending life lesson.
1 ||| This is perfect entertainment for those who find 'Teletubbies' and 'Dora the Explorer' to be a little too highbrow.
1 ||| An unsatisfying sequel to a very mediocre first film. It is so unfunny and painful that I actually saw people walking out of the free screening I attended.
1 ||| The film as a whole is only marginally less entertaining than playing roadkill Frisbee.
1 ||| Blending CGI and live action, this "squeakquel" to the witless 2007 kids' film proves just how dangerous such technology is when placed in the wrong hands.
1 ||| They call this the "squeakquel" and that's about all you'll want to know about a film that remorselessly pulls all the levers of the first highly successful box-office attraction.
1 ||| Throwaway fun at some points of the film, but on the whole it's simply very frustrating.
3 ||| By frontloading the dramatic meat of the story, the film becomes less about shocking revelations or plot twists than the sometimes comic, sometimes serious dynamics of a family under extreme strain.
3 ||| A gift that keeps on giving
3 ||| Arnaud Desplechin doesn't so much direct movies as conduct marathons.
3 ||| A dysfunctional French family learning that `it is never too late to bring love, peace and healing into a divisive and unforgiving household.
4 ||| In working to keep the audience off-center...Desplechin artfully makes the well-worn family weekend plot endearing again. [Blu-ray]
4 ||| A Christmas Tale brilliantly captures the melancholy and familial recrimination that, for some people, is as much a part of the holiday season as fruitcake and egg nog.
4 ||| Dark secrets are unlocked, words draw more blood than punches, and [director] Desplechin turns one family into a universe that resembles life as a startling work of art.
4 ||| a work of intoxicating genius.
3 ||| Enduringly fascinating and involving.
3 ||| Has as much emotional baggage as any soap opera but not an ounce of melodrama, exploring the cuts and letting us understand the scars.
4 ||| How do you say, 'Don't even go there, girlfriend!' in French?
3 ||| Some wry humor runs through the course of the overly long saga. But there's not enough dark wit to mitigate the tedium and pretentiousness.
4 ||| If Ingmar Bergman and Wes Anderson some how collaborated on a movie together, I'd guess their sensibilities would yield something like Arnaud Desplechin's darkly hilarious, brilliantly acted A Christmas Tale.
3 ||| Wry, observant and frequently heartbreaking.
3 ||| Those looking for a cheery family gathering for the holidays flick might want to look elsewhere. Those who enjoy quirky family dramas, beautifully written, performed and shot will be thrilled by Desplechin's latest.
4 ||| The characters' explosive emotions - tender and bitter, guilt-wracked and willfully inscrutable - make "A Christmas Tale" an edge-of-your-seat experience in a way most thrillers could only dream about.
4 ||| A sprawling, complex web of family betrayals, emotionally stunted relationships, disappointments, banishments and plain old eccentric behavior are cliché by now, but in this movie it's all so frighteningly true.
3 ||| Getting through these first 20 minutes is as necessary as plowing through the first 50 pages of a 19th century novel. Once that work is over, the movie's singular pleasures reveal themselves.
3 ||| If Four Christmases is merely a stocking stuffer, this is the new car out in the driveway with the big red ribbon around it.
3 ||| The family's vulnerabilities and eccentricities burrow under the skin.
3 ||| A classic French family drama featuring fine performances by legend Catherine Deneuve and reigning star Mathieu Amalric even if the raging and crying might be a bit much for the Christmas season.
3 ||| A Christmas Tale is long but it exerts enough of a pull that the 150 minutes pass rapidly, if not necessarily painlessly.
3 ||| Depslachin's film is not brimming over with good cheer, hardly, but it is warm and sometimes funny and refreshingly honest, illustrating the complicated beast that often is family.
4 ||| Roiling with laughter, tears, drunken confessions, revelatory soliloquies, pain, sorrow, hospital visits, and various kinds of love, A Christmas Tale is a smart, sprawling, and sublimely entertaining feast.
4 ||| It's a simple picture about complicated people, the members and sometime-combatants of the extended Vuillard family.
4 ||| There are simply too many marvels to tally.
4 ||| To tweak Tolstoy: All happy families may be alike, but all unhappy-family movies are entertaining in their own ways.
3 ||| A Christmas Tale is beautifully acted by all. The bigger dramatic moments in the film are believable, but the occasional fights and arguments cannot hold a candle to the quieter moments of truth permeating out of the scenes.
4 ||| A strangely encompassing collection of private moments among the members of a large family with a fraught history.
4 ||| A picture of unpleasant people treating each other poorly that comes across as buoyant and frankly joyful at times.
3 ||| Through a thicket of subplots..., Desplechin slowly and gracefully unfolds the damage done by years of bad blood.
3 ||| Filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin (Kings and Queens) and his co-screenwriter Emmanuel Mourdieu have created something that is rich with characters and themes.
3 ||| Yet as the film progresses these multifarious layers of dramatic ennui and vitriol becomes absolutely intoxicating, and before I knew it my eyes were glued to the screen and I almost couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next.
3 ||| [It] will make anyone dreading the holidays with their family grateful for what strife they may face. It's nothing compared to what the Vuillard clan gets up to.
3 ||| A minor masterpiece.
4 ||| At last, a great contemporary holiday movie that's strictly for grown-ups -- a holiday movie that really is a moviegoer's holiday from desultory daily fare.
3 ||| A CHRISTMAS TALE is your typical Holiday drama that's elevated by stylish direction and an infectious energy
4 ||| A Christmas Tale is the yuletide antidote to Four Christmases.
3 ||| There's a giddiness to this whirling dervish of a film, with its spastic skipping from character and catharsis, its near fetishistic camera trickery, bursts of song, and loving lifts from the likes of Vertigo and Nietzsche.
3 ||| For people who find that movies that are full of sentimentality and sympathy set off their gag reflex, this is the holiday movie for you.
4 ||| A Christmas Tale seems less like a movie than a genuine family being observed.
4 ||| If you want to see a Christmas story that's genuinely heartwarming and entertaining without ever slipping into phony sentimentality, you'd better learn to read subtitles.
3 ||| A warmly inviting motion picture.
3 ||| A compellingly literate exploration of the muddle of misguided motives and lingering regrets that bind families together.
4 ||| What could have been the acme of talky dramas about the inner lives of French intellectuals turns out to be a feast of a movie.
3 ||| Bustling and chaotic like most big families, this film really captures the outrageous collision of personalities in any gathering of relatives
3 ||| Arnaud Desplechin's headfirst dive into the complex relationships within a middle class French family is a messy, captivating, and very much living affair.
3 ||| A droll and frantic melodrama stripped of aesthetic contrivances but full of emotional ones, and it is affirming in its own way without being particularly cathartic.
3 ||| Controlled chaos of a family reunion highlighed by likeable but flawed characters
3 ||| The film (has) a sensibility that is paradoxically both old-fashioned and very modern.
3 ||| Not very cheerful holiday fare? Turns out to be more upbeat than you'd think, without any angels or friendly ghosts, thanks to Desplechin's affectionate approach to his characters.
4 ||| The movie teems with the excitement of unwrapping a present, even as it deals more seriously with the intractability of blood ties.
3 ||| As the rituals of Christmas are observed, the family edges closer towards a sense of understanding and acceptance in a picture that captures a sense of life's messy uncertainties and the way we sometimes hurt the ones we love the most.
3 ||| It's maddening and it's exhilarating.
3 ||| Desplechin's film is so well cast and the relationships so authentically depicted that it's okay not to be completely or partially taken by Junon, Henri, and the rest of their kin.
4 ||| A Christmas Tale is a lively, capricious, mischievous ensemble delight.
3 ||| Despite occasional bouts of tedium over the epic course, a surprising buoyancy emerges: Desplechin's methods begin to inform, even brighten, the message.
3 ||| Perfect off-season timing for a wickedly off-kilter movie about a French family Christmas in extremis.
1 ||| Why is a movie that's trying to evoke some of the cool metropolitanism of late-'70s Woody Allen so rammed with hoary gags about New York being awash with transvestites and homeless flashers?
3 ||| The positives of The Rebound vastly outweigh the minor criticisms. It's also not afraid to adopt a sudden tonal shift at a key juncture of the plot, which works fairly well.
1 ||| ven slap-bang in the middle of the worst year for romcoms in living memory, The Rebound deserves a special boot up the backside for its raging incompetence.
1 ||| An unromantic comedy that gets down and dirty.
1 ||| Nothing more than an elongated soap opera, sans the self-awareness.
1 ||| Thank God Whitaker is here to bring a bit of real pathos and ambiguity to his role as the spiritual guide who's gained wisdom through adversity, because without his Oscar-winning chops, this exercise in pop mysticism would have been too painful to bear.
1 ||| Starts with a not-very-original insight and takes too many shortcuts delivering it.
3 ||| Kudos to writer/director/co-star Philippe Caland for crafting such a refreshingly unpredictable cautionary tale and for coaxing inspired performances from an A-list cast which inludes by Forest Whitaker, Virginia Madsen and Minnie Driver.
3 ||| The film survives mostly off the wonderful, absorbing leading performance by Binoche, in what a truly layered character to get your head around.
3 ||| When an actor is as good as Juliette Binoche they can elevate an entire film.
3 ||| Cleverly, the film makes it clear that Binoche is also strongly motivated by bringing suffering and injustice to light, making the central conflict that bit sharper.
3 ||| Too prickly for mainstream crowds and rather emotionally sentimental for arthouse fans, this drama may have trouble finding an audience.
4 ||| "1,000 Times Good Night" has moments of both startling violence and breathtaking beauty.
3 ||| A sensitive drama about the challenges idealists and people of great passion face within the family circle.
4 ||| The whole cast is good, but as always, all roads lead to Binoche, who is wonderful.
3 ||| As one would expect with of a film made by a photographer, 1,000 Times Good Night is always visually interesting.
3 ||| When we see photos or film footage taken at great risk on the front line we rarely stop to think of the price paid by the photographer; this film rectifies that.
3 ||| As for Binoche, her performance as Rebecca is a standout even in a year that included winning turns in films from Fred Schepisi and Olivier Assayas.
1 ||| An outsider adolescent sinks in a sea of troubles in this wobbly comedy.
1 ||| There's little indication, beyond the endlessly unfunny school humiliations and fogey-dom signposts (ha ha, he uses Old Spice), that the notion of a preteen codger is worth our sympathies.
1 ||| confidently struts along, seemingly unaware of its lackluster script and distinct lack of professionalism.
4 ||| A harrowing mindbender which successfully blends elements of X-Men, The Matrix and Memento while adding some of its own unique sci-fi flava.
3 ||| The film is blessed with a frenetic pace that simultaneously accomplishes two things: it keeps the energy level high while obfuscating some of the most obvious logical flaws in the plot's structure.
1 ||| Movies don't get more headache-inducing than Push.
3 ||| A trippy, nonstop action fest, with the feel of a really good episode of Heroes.
3 ||| Push is NBC's Heroes, if anything ever happened on Heroes besides oh so mysterious prophecies and a litany of excuses to avoid action sequences.
3 ||| ...a fun thriller that has a couple of tricks up it's sleeve.
1 ||| Imagine if the X-Men had spent most of their time sitting around talking about how they were going to fight Magneto instead of ever actually doing anything and you'll have a good sense of what is wrong with Push.
0 ||| In plot, it meanders. In character development, it implodes. In action, it plods. In effect, it numbs, but, alas, not quickly enough.
1 ||| There are many problems with Push, and most are the usual boring things: unnecessary plot loops; long, dumb musical interludes; a charmless script; and ostentatious action sequences in which the only person excited is the cameraman.
1 ||| By the time the credits roll, your most fervent wish is to run into a 'wiper' (one who can erase memories).
1 ||| A bargain basement melding of clichés from the X-Men franchise and TV's Heroes.
1 ||| It's like watching an X-Men movie that doesn't feature the leather costumes and which doesn't have enough in the way of requisite thrills or action to keep anyone interested in it for very long.
3 ||| With mediocre expectations going in, the flick's cleverness, great score and wicked fight scenes lead me to recommend this to anyone looking for a good time.
3 ||| What really struck me more than the plot itself was McGuigan's amazing use of location and space; it feels as if this movie and these characters are really living in Hong Kong.
1 ||| Movers, pushers, shadowers - whatever! The script was insane and the characters were inane.
1 ||| Silliness rules the day: plot holes abound and are plugged with techno-pounding action sequences and more nonsensical guff. As a TV pilot, this might have worked; as a film, it's loud, confusing and inane.
1 ||| "What if nothing we did made any sense. Would that throw them off the scent?" Nick asks. You bet.
1 ||| If the words "A bit like Jumper but not as good" strike fear into your heart then you might want to avoid this turgid superpower stinker.
1 ||| A movie so bland, it might as well have been filmed in Hounslow.
1 ||| Why would a psychic 'tec need to sniff a toothbrush to locate its user? Does spearmint freshness have a spooky vibe?
1 ||| In time this would-be thriller comes to rest with a fist fight, a hanging ending and the implicit promise of a sequel. Of all the calamities that Fanning predicts, Push 2 is one she missed.
1 ||| Sci-fi hokum to give you a headache.
1 ||| Totally watchable, totally forgettable.
1 ||| Director Paul McGuigan serves this up with a flashy swagger but there is no disguising the fact that it is an incomprehensible mess.
1 ||| The premise is promising all right, but it's a movie over-stuffed with talk and actors with a glazed look as though they too aren't sure of what they're doing.
1 ||| Light fixtures are the true stars in "Push," constantly reflecting, twinkling and popping. Its best moments are when guns levitate and fire themselves. When you don't even need actors to hold pistols, it's the ultimate in autopilot filmmaking.
3 ||| jThe script has no deep meaning and the film does just what it was intended to do: take an audience on a fantastical journey with loads of action.
3 ||| Tough, brutish prison drama with an easy windup, but good acting and an uncompromising take on the prison system.
3 ||| This tough, uncompromising, cautionary thriller should be a wake-up call about America's outrageously archaic laws insofar as defending the sanctity of home and family.
4 ||| ...establishes itself as a gritty, thoroughly compelling prison drama that rarely relies on the various tropes of the genre.
3 ||| Explores how violence is endemic in the prisoner, no matter their background, almost as soon as their sentencing is handed down.
1 ||| To make a 3-D 'torture porn' movie is at best opportunist; to make one with flat, boring torture scenes is unforgivable.
1 ||| This nasty, witless and hopelessly dated effort is still a landmark release. Think of it like the first dog shot into space, but don't forget it is an absolute dog.
1 ||| Another week, another yucky horror film with a title that sounds like "Saw". This one's in 3D.
1 ||| The result is humourless, implausible and lacks a single original idea. There would be no reason for this film to exist, were it not the first live action feature shot entirely in HD3D.
1 ||| This kind of torture porn is beyond bad taste.
1 ||| This boasts of being "a first of its kind 3D movie event", but it's just the same old torture porn tarted up.
1 ||| As one character asks, "It never stops, does it?" Well, no. Not as long as people keep paying to see such dreck.
1 ||| I'd read about this one for three years. Then I saw it and forgot it immediately.
1 ||| The sole high point? 3D tits. The porn industry is going to love this technology, presuming you don't mind wearing stupid dark glasses while masturbating.
1 ||| The Unborn is a mishmash of half-formed ideas more asinine and exploitative than frightening. At least the title is accurate; this junk is stillborn all the way.
1 ||| has the psychological weight and perversity of a mildly racy episode of Touched by an Angel
0 ||| If the films released during the traditional January dumping ground are going to be this bad, we should employ the nation's best scientists to rearrange Earth's orbit so the year begins in February.
1 ||| An early contender for worst movie of the year.
1 ||| This is where many a horror movie falls and never again rises: too much exposition.
1 ||| The movie's not very good, but there are ideas, good and bad, in its execution that are worth mulling over.
1 ||| Unless we trudge up the aisle prematurely, we're stuck there, with nothing to do but count Oldman's changing accents or mourn that this is the best gig actresses like Alexander or Gugino can get.
1 ||| About the only thing here that will haunt your dreams is the film's final scene, which conveniently portends a sequel.
1 ||| The picture is such an embarrassment, Goyer has to be hoping that very few people will see it.
1 ||| Using the Holocaust as the basis for a horror movie is pretty distasteful, but what offended me the most about The Unborn is how sloppy it is.
1 ||| Could have just as easily been called "The Un-scary," "The Uninspiring," "The Unoriginal," or "The Unexciting". Whatever you do, just un-plan to see it this weekend.
1 ||| I'm not sure if it's the fault of the script or studio tampering, but The Unborn's watered-down approach to WWII makes Isla: She Wolf of the SS seem downright sensitive in comparison
1 ||| This stuff is scary in the same way that twelve random ingredients from your kitchen is soup.
0 ||| pacing that allows the audience to linger on every failing before being distracted by the subsequent one
1 ||| A ham-fisted attempt at a Semitic version of The Exorcist that is utterly unoriginal and totally devoid of actual frights.
1 ||| The Unborn is so lame that even a scene where Nazi 'doctors' experiment on twin children by poking a needle in their eyeballs is more laughable than horrendous.
1 ||| This is one film that shouldn't have been birthed. No, in fact, it should have been aborted.
1 ||| Falls very much line with early-year schlock.
1 ||| ...a salad of creepshow cliches...
1 ||| The film's story is not so much plagued by plot holes as it is constructed out of them, not unlike an especially lacy variety of Swiss cheese.
0 ||| Every January, as the "January junk" makes its annoying appearance on the big screen, a lackluster PG-13-rated horror movie is involved. 'The Unborn' is that movie for 2009.
1 ||| This orgy of crazed effects, cheap scares and jittery suspense never remotely frightens us
1 ||| Goyer's psychic dream sequences are pretty good - what a pity he decided to ruin them with a movie.
1 ||| Despite some gruesome special effects, the telling of this story is so prosaic and predictable that genuine thrills are in very short supply.
1 ||| David S Goyer's non-kosher riff on 'The Exorcist' is stillborn,
1 ||| A scary movie so fantastically stupid and crass it made my skull contract and my sinuses harden to the consistency of pipe-cleaners.
1 ||| Hampered by the 15 rating, director David S Goyer is reduced to yawn-worthy jump-scares and recycled Exorcist gags to do his dirty work.
0 ||| Unborn should have been strangled at birth.
1 ||| Less spine-chilling and more eye-drooping.
1 ||| Some of the ideas here may seem original, if questionable, but the treatment -- by writer-director David Goyer -- is strictly conventional, with the shock moments obviously inserted at regular intervals, usually while the heroine is in her underwear.
1 ||| After a few initial decent scares, the corny dialogue, poor casting and cringe-worthy acting drag this movie into it's own hell. Utter rubbish.
1 ||| Cue a creepy toddler, various demonically possessed adults and a Jewish exorcism conducted by Gary Oldman. He's a vastly better actor than the film deserves, but he can't make the script seem even slightly better than it is.
1 ||| The Unborn is like a scary movie sentence without the necessary linking verbs. It's all genre gears and no motivational motor.
1 ||| What The Unborn represents manages to be a thousand times more disturbing than anything Goyer captured with his pen or camera
1 ||| Should have been aborted.
1 ||| The Unborn is packed full of grisly images and effects, but its apparent attempts to be some kind of Jewish take on The Exorcist fail miserably.
1 ||| Smoking-hot heroine. Clever paranormal premise. Painfully clueless conclusion.
1 ||| Unoriginal, unbelievable, utterly unwatchable.
0 ||| I kept hoping Oldman would revert to his Sid & Nancy punk persona and kick the little freak in the yarbles like some pain-deserving Springsteen fan, but no such luck.
0 ||| I truly, truly recommend watching either of those instead of The Unborn. Or your wall. Just staring at your wall is also an acceptable alternative too.
1 ||| If the film's half-baked salaciousness feels merely risible, its slapdash screenplay and cheapo look make it something that its generic forbearers rarely were: boring.
1 ||| Just go watch Death Proof again instead.
0 ||| Adhering to the belief that action scenes are more thrilling when you can't tell what the hell is going on, the director gives us just the "highlights."
1 ||| The whole package here is warmed-over mush from a hundred other sports movies, a tale padded out with game footage, training sequences, absurd coincidences, life lessons that teach nothing and wasted casting.
1 ||| American rugby is the setting for this earnest sausage party of macho posturing, bro-dacious life lessons and value-focused sportsmanship that give wayward teens the strength to rise above sinful temptations.
3 ||| While it does boast some of the expected tropes and formulas of cinematic sports dramas, it's a competent, entertaining and involving movie that features a decent message about self-discipline and redemption.
4 ||| [Director Ryan] Little and cinematographer T.C. Christensen make you feel the heat in every scrum.
0 ||| As directed by Ryan Little and written by David Pliler, Forever Strong dredges up every sports movie clich and stereotype ever invented. (Cue the slow-mo in the rain.)
3 ||| Another symphony of exquisitely choreographed carnage.
3 ||| Yes, it's extremely choppy and not terribly well-developed, with characters appearing and disappearing at random. But the fights are so impressive that we can't help but be thoroughly entertained.
3 ||| Chocolate gives us the first autistic action hero.
4 ||| At its heart, Chocolate is a simple tale of a special girl trying to make her way in a considerably unspecial world.
3 ||| Vimistananda is nothing less than an awe-inspiring force of nature.
3 ||| Chocolate (Chokgohlaet) offers sensational martial arts set pieces -- beautifully choreographed, exquisitely colored, and acrobatically shot.
3 ||| It's called Chocolate, but Cheese would have been just as good. Soaked with tears, full of schmaltz, and yet strewn with bodies, Prachya Pinkaew's new kick-'em-up is extreme action, extreme melodrama, and extremely hard to resist.
3 ||| If you've never heard of "Fireproof," that could mean you are not a member of a faith-based community. On the other hand, it just might mean that you haven't stumbled upon this new release that packed Quad-City theaters over the weekend.
3 ||| Geared for the same Christian audience that loved "Facing the Giants," it is another winner for the Kendricks brothers
3 ||| After a shaky start and a steady middle, the film ends on a genuinely moving note; the folks at Sherwood Baptist Church have made their most impressive movie yet.
0 ||| With the production values of a straight-to-video cheapie and the script of a mediocre soap opera, Fireproof is good for just about one thing: dousing whatever flames might be left in your marriage.
1 ||| Fireproof isn't merely preaching to the already converted; it's helping to further alienate the unconverted and the skeptical.
1 ||| It's one of the funniest films I've seen all year and that was obviously not the intention. This was made for elderly folk who watch Oprah and Dr. Phil and only see 2 movies a year. Embarrassing.
1 ||| The writing and directing Kendrick brothers, Alex and Stephen, have raised blandness and narrative predictability to the level of high art.
3 ||| This is a great, fun entertainer with lots of charm and great music.
3 ||| It's all done with an infectious zest and effervescence that keeps the ribs tickling.
3 ||| It's tempting to call The Garden a story of innocence and experience, of evil corrupting paradise, but that would be doing a disservice to the fascinating complexities of a classic Los Angeles conflict and an excellent doc that does them full justice.
4 ||| A beautiful portrait of a unique downtown LA community of poor Mexican-Americans who've turned urban blight into a marvelous garden and fight a developer determined to shut them down. A moving, inspiring documentary.
3 ||| Presents a classic story of the little guy taking on The Man with both thrilling and frustrating results.
3 ||| A documentary about fighting city hall, the empty promises of politicians, backroom deals, small victories over the Man and the cost paid by a handful of farmers who endured all of the above. Imagine if John Steinbeck rewrote the script for
4 ||| A heartbreaking documentary which landed a well-deserved Oscar-nomination for its touching portrayal of Spanish-speaking salt-of-the-earth who find it hard to fathom that the legal system could possibly side with a crook out to flatten the fruit of their
1 ||| The Garden is an especially fatuous documentary, nominated for an Oscar this year, about a community garden in South Central LA where Latino farmers have been allowed to grow food on somebody else's land.
4 ||| A compelling documentary about an urban garden collective and their fight for justice in a nation where poor people are expected to keep quiet and not speak truth to power.
3 ||| The documentary digs deep into the racial and monetary problems of a tumultuous, melting-pot community.
4 ||| A compelling, inspirational, provocative and thoroughly engrossing documentary.
3 ||| [Director Kennedy] lets his subjects tell their tales in their own words. And that's what really makes the film interesting.
3 ||| The Garden moves beyond the feel good facet of any apparent ending to show how stark, stupid reality can rip said victory away. It won't make sense - none of these 'us vs. them' situations ever do - but it does create compelling cinema.
3 ||| It's easy to tell what side the filmmaker takes, which leads to unanswered questions... [Director Scott Hamilton] Kennedy's compelling documentary is quite thorough otherwise.
3 ||| The creature feature is loaded with blood, guts, gore, the perfect anti-hero and a hilariously fun plot, which is played straight until the very end...Wilkins delivers a simple, yet effective '80s creature feature that's not only scary, but also a great t
3 ||| Splinter's got all the elements that make for a great midnight movie, something horror fans will be telling one another about for weeks, maybe months, afterwards.
3 ||| Once audiences get over snickering at a creature that they initially write off as a rabid hedgehog (too bad that Geoffrey Rush film already snatched up the title Quills), they'll be happy to strap in for a satisfying ride.
3 ||| A high-end feature-length version of The Outer Limits, combined with a fond enthusiasm for creative gore and populated by a trio of characters who are actually interesting.
3 ||| Exactly what a B-movie should be.
3 ||| a nifty example of the horror-movie as thrill ride
3 ||| The movie's awash in blood, sure, but it has more brains on hand than just the ones dripping down the wall.
3 ||| With Splinter, the director Toby Wilkins honors the conventions of the horror genre with skill and enough wit to keep the scares sharp.
3 ||| Four people. One Kwik-E-Mart style shop. One crazed creature. Splinter proves that's all you need for a chilling horror movie.
3 ||| If you can get beyond one basic narrative flaw, and a low budget dynamic which provides limited looks at our Bottin-inspired fiends, Splinter will come as a wonderful little fright flick surprise.
4 ||| A very efficient and effective (for its budget) zombie-infection-sci-fi-thriller
3 ||| ...worth checking out if only for Norton's phenomenal, Oscar-worthy turn as the film's diametrically opposed twins.
3 ||| Writer/director Tim Blake Nelson manages a finely tuned balance that is rare in cinema. Moving from the far reaches of comedy to the nether regions of drama, he never skips a beat or sets the pitch too high.
4 ||| Tim Blake Nelson's Leaves of Grass is some kind of sweet, wacky masterpiece. It takes all sorts of risks, including a dual role with Edward Norton playing twin brothers, and it pulls them off.
3 ||| Emerging director Tim Blake Nelson takes another step up with this comedy drama starring Edward Norton in what might go down as Norton's best performance yet.
3 ||| As a writer-director, Nelson keeps the laughs coming at a steady pace, and never condescends to his articulate redneck characters.
3 ||| Mr. Norton is a pleasure to watch, and so is everyone else.
1 ||| Suffice to say that Blake Nelson doesn't have the visual gifts of his Minnesotan mentors, leaving us undistracted by surface flair and fully focused on his cartoonish characters and ragged, oddly callow script.
3 ||| It's a jarringly realistic hybrid that echoes the more surreal aspects of real, rural life, and Norton walks/ambles through it all, sporting dueling personalities and distinct accents, but one very serious heart.
3 ||| An offbeat thriller that is deepened -- rather than derailed -- by its tricky shift from darkly funny to just plain dark.
3 ||| Maybe too small-scale to be anything truly special, but an original and witty film that both surprises and entertains.
3 ||| It's well put together, colourful, typifies Indian culture and values, is very emotional, and is a typically numbing 3 hours long. Ticks all the boxes then...
3 ||| This agreeably amusing comedy/romance/musical is Another Mash-Up Made by Bollywood. Writer-director Aditya Chopra's film suggests a star-powered Billy Wilder love farce, Grease and Shall We Dance.
3 ||| Leave it to Shahrukh Khan to make what sounds preposterous on paper to be both hilarious and emotionally involving.
3 ||| It is about as pleasing a star-driven comedy as one could reasonably expect to open in wide release during the dog days of summer.
3 ||| With Ms. Bullock playing a lady only a polar bear could warm up to and Ryan Reynolds' exquisite balancing of the dynamics of the situation, this romantic comedy finds a sweet comfort level.
4 ||| An old-fashioned romp reminiscent of the best of Doris Day and Rock Hudson!
3 ||| Director Anne Fletcher knows where the comedy lies in an improbable but cute screenplay by Peter Chiarelli, it's in her two stars and she lets them fly.
3 ||| The stars aren't going to erase memories of Hepburn and Tracy, or Lombard and Powell, but Bullock and Reynolds - even when playing a naked bathroom scene together - make a good fit.
1 ||| has fleeting moments of hilarity and charisma, but ultimately falls flat as a romance, comedy and drama with an inane, sitcom-ish, uninspired and lazy screenplay along with sloppy editing and direction.
3 ||| Surprisingly charming and smartly executed.
3 ||| Never underestimate the pleasure of a sparkly screwball comedy - and a fluffy puppy.
3 ||| All this predictable, romantic/screwball comedy really has to do is supply us with a steady supply of laughs. And in that regard, the film succeeds.
1 ||| A romantic comedy so numbing it feels like Novocaine.
3 ||| The setup is formula, but Bullock and Reynolds supply surprising fizz and kick.
1 ||| It's been made according to the chapter in the box-office manual labeled "summer counter-programming."
1 ||| Oh Sandra Bullock, why do you do this to yourself?
3 ||| The Proposal recycles a plot that was already old when Tracy and Hepburn were trying it out. You see it coming from a great distance away. As it draws closer, you don't duck out of the way, because it is so cheerfully done, you don't mind being hit by it.
3 ||| Bullock and Reynolds play against type well, and their spicy chemistry is contagious. But while the leads are doing their thing, Betty White slips in and steals the movie.
3 ||| Bullock and Reynolds' chemistry propels charming romcom.
3 ||| Without question this riotously funny flick is the year's best comedy -- at least so far.
3 ||| The bar for modern rom-coms remains depressingly low, but The Proposal clears it with ease.
3 ||| Onscreen chemistry is an elusive notion but you know it when you see it, and Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds definitely have it in The Proposal.
3 ||| Although The Proposal isn't a sweep-you-off-your-feet affair, Bullock and Reynolds make it a thoroughly charming engagement.
4 ||| The Proposal restores Sandra Bullock to comic glory. It's her best role since While You Were Sleeping.
1 ||| Anne Fletcher has practically established herself as the anti-feminist, playing more to the hopeless ring chasers out there rather than those who might be insulted at the prospect of independent women needing a man in their lives to complete them.
3 ||| Despite its less than original pedigree, The Proposal is a perfect example of a predictable, formulaic script elevated by fine acting and palpable chemistry.
1 ||| The experience of watching 'The Proposal" is not unlike attending a performance from a cover band specializing in the songs of Billy Joel--both offer up the prospect of two hours of mind-numbing blandness without a single original element on display.
3 ||| The "here comes the bribe" relationship between these two likable personalities mirrors that of an ice cream cone that starts off freezing cold and then deliciously melts from the sizzling summer heat.
1 ||| As one embarrassing scene follows another, The Proposal accumulates so many bad vibes that it becomes grimly compelling.
3 ||| Cookie-cutter characters inhabit a paper-thin plot while being helplessly propelled to a cliché climax.
3 ||| By its own modest aims, it's not horrible ...
3 ||| Bullock and Reynolds are appealing enough to make viewers care if real love will emerge from the legal ploy.
3 ||| The chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds makes this good movie even better
3 ||| The Proposal is a delicious revamping of a Doris Day-like vehicle for Bullock (e.g. Pillow Talk). A virginal (or near-virginal), uptight heroine loosens up and finds true love after she discovers the man she has little patience for is her ideal mate.
4 ||| The fresh dialogue, gorgeous scenery, and ultimately winsome love story make this one of the most appealing romances to come down the pike in recent years.
3 ||| It breaks no new ground, is predictable at every turn, and no one will remember a thing about it a week after they see it. All that said, The Proposal is above-average.
3 ||| The Proposal feels both new and familiar. It's new, in that it doesn't obey a lot of rules of romantic comedies, while not breaking with tradition, and familiar in that it is reminiscent of some of the best romantic comedies without seeming too derivativ
1 ||| Sandra Bullock is teamed up with Ryan Reynolds, and each star's face has a waxy immobility that has nothing to do with Botox; the pure awfulness of the script has paralysed their facial muscles.
1 ||| As a fish-out-of-water comedy, it's so lousy that you keep wishing someone would put the poor fish out of its misery.
1 ||| Another dagger in the back of romantic comedy.
1 ||| Dear Hollywood, from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health . . . please stop parping out meritless tripe like this.
3 ||| For better or for worse, this could be a hot contender for the best romcom of the year. Might not be the most original, but it's certainly the most consistently funny and well played.
3 ||| At the Sandra Bullock Movie Factory, a Hunky Co-Star Assembly Line rivets a new head on a standard male muscular body per SB pic.
3 ||| I was engaged by the fiery chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds.
3 ||| There is something to be said for such a relentlessly by-the-numbers chick flick programmer that is nonetheless a breezily enjoyable sit.
3 ||| The Proposal doesn't blaze any new ground, but it doesn't raze any old ground either. It's a solid, old-fashioned romantic comedy that's more interested in the romance than in being silly or raunchy. These days, that's refreshing enough.
3 ||| It's not awful, certainly not memorable and - despite the words of at least one quote whore - it's not "the year's best comedy."
1 ||| annoyingly predictable and barely watchable piece of Hollywood routine
3 ||| Despite borrowing virtually eery rom-com plot device, screenwriter Pete Chiarelli keeps the dialogue crisp and witty.
0 ||| Director Matt Aselton cites Buñuel as an influence, but he fails to understand the difference between being a surrealist and being a nonsense-ist.
3 ||| Credit Dano and Deschanel for generating sufficient chemistry to make the movie worthwhile despite the oft-distracting Kabuki dances dominating the backdrop.
1 ||| A note to all indie filmmakers (one that will be too late for Matt Aselton, writer (with Adam Nagata) and director of GIGANTIC): quirky is a tone, not a plot.
0 ||| Just a bunch of strange character traits strung together for no reason other than quirk.
3 ||| For a film that only flirts with the idea of closure it may be best to just keep an open mind and enjoy the company of some fine actors playing funny characters trying to find the same answers that all of us are.
0 ||| With curdled humor and cardboard characters, this ghastly movie completely misses the mark.
4 ||| Quirk fans, prepare to be lightly exhilarated.
1 ||| Seriously? Indie directors are still making painfully twee, self-conscious romances all these years after Sundance birthed so many quirky cliches?
0 ||| Anyone can go off and just cynically make a bad movie, but to make a picture as inert, incompetent and emotionally fraudulent as Gigantic takes sincere faith that one is, in fact, making something really, really good.
0 ||| Eventually Gigantic decides to become a heartwarmer, and why not? Any ending -- including nuclear devastation or a 1940s musical number -- would have worked, too.
3 ||| This quirky and engaging comedy sports smart dialogue, a surreal premise and a stellar cast.
3 ||| First-time feature director Matt Aselton, who co-wrote the darkly funny, well-observed script with Adam Nagata, has crafted a disarming tale that's one of the better independent films in recent memory.
1 ||| There's nothing really appealing or funny about these people or the predicaments in which they find themselves.
1 ||| Like committee-created sketches at comedy clubs, where the audience shouts out random, zany ideas, Gigantic is huge on the random. But unlike the comedy club, there is little, if anything, to enjoy.
3 ||| Happy would be sad if you didn't want to see her story. And you wouldn't like a Manic Pixie Dream Girl when she's angry.
3 ||| Zooey Deschanel is the most delightful young actress in Hollywood.
3 ||| ...the story of how two emotionally damaged but terribly affected andprivileged underachievers meet, fall in love and presumably somehow form a family.
1 ||| This determinedly nonsensical American indie feels like it was assembled in an off-world quirk factory.
1 ||| This film is entirely empty: empty of substance, devoid of plausible characters, and without anything like a satisfying style.
3 ||| Here the characters drive everything - they're quirky without being annoying, funny without being clownish and odd but realistic. As funny and interesting as it is, however, the film raises more question than it answers.
3 ||| It's very hard not to get sucked in to the charm of this movie. Dano and Deschanel play their parts to perfection, exuding just the right amount of awkwardness and insecurity to bring the story to life.
1 ||| Everything that happens slots neatly into the art house template - wacky leads, wackier supporting players, coy alt-rock soundtrack - but director Matt Aselton doesn't know when to stop.
1 ||| By the end, I was thoroughly alienated by the movie's twee, self-satisfied empty-headedness and rooting for the homeless man to do his worst.
3 ||| This gentle romance is so wilfully quirky that it will drive some audiences a bit crazy. But if you can connect to the film's warmth and the humanity of its characters, it really gets under the skin.
1 ||| This is some of the worst writing of the year, from the meaningless title down. Oh yeah, and a tramp keeps showing up to beat up Dano throughout. Not quite sure why, but I applaud the effort.
4 ||| While Fuel takes persuasive swipes at the influence of oil-based energy companies over domestic and foreign policy, the film is more dazzling as an introduction to all kinds of clean energy alternatives many of us have never heard of.
1 ||| Fuel's message is clear -- oil is bad; alternative energy is good -- and its goals are simple -- put Big Oil out of business by selling the American public on the virtues of cleaner energy sources, such as wind, solar, ethanol, hemp, and world music.
3 ||| Smartly animated interstitials, memorable archival material and a lively soundtrack round out the fast-paced proceedings.
3 ||| Tickell makes his case in an entertaining and hence all the more effective manner.
3 ||| One of the refreshing traits of this action-nudging documentary is Tickell's willingness to wrestle his own biases.
3 ||| For a film about energy, it's marvelous that Tickell ultimately gives us all the proverbial power.
3 ||| A peppy, bouncy documentary that is watchable and informative, although Tickell's celebrity name-dropping at times detracts from the serious message.
3 ||| A good natured cheer-leading session for clean vehicles, "Fuel" is several measures short of the intensity it will take to put Hummers where they belong---in museums.
3 ||| Tickell keeps the film hopping along, far more interested in the positive than a woe-is-us mentality
3 ||| shows the not-so-shocking connections between the auto industry, the oil industry and the government, prescriptively offering alternatives ...
3 ||| Hush proves you don't need a Jason, Freddy or Michael to create a nasty little horror showcase.
3 ||| Hush becomes a tight little thriller that waves the flag for British horror.
3 ||| One of Garbo's best and most affecting films.
3 ||| A slick, MGM production with a great cast but without much Tolstoy left.
3 ||| Garbo speaks again in one of her best.
3 ||| Orphan works because it's a film that knows exactly what it wants to be -- creepy as all get out -- and does everything possible to achieve that goal.
3 ||| One of the best entries in the cute-as-a-button-psycho-demon-child-from-hell subgenre.
4 ||| An unnerving psychological thriller with the atmospheric elegance of classics like Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now and Dressed to Kill, masterful in its blends of style and substance, violence and mayhem.
3 ||| During a summer with the usual transforming robots and young wizards, this chilly flick is a bit of a break, and there are worse options than letting this Orphan in the door.
3 ||| A thoroughly enjoyable demon-spawn movie in the tradition of The Bad Seed (1956) and The Other (1972).
4 ||| Here is a shamelessly effective horror film based on the most diabolical of movie malefactors, a child.
1 ||| I would have laughed if the movie hadn't already sucked my soul from my body
3 ||| The stomach-knotting is kept taut throughout, and the acting is first-rate -- none more than Fuhrman, who seems to have the self-awareness and skill to be one of the best child actors around.
4 ||| As much fun as it is to follow Orphan's improbable developments, there is also a dark undercurrent that lingers with you afterward. It's that troubling theme that takes the movie from good to almost great.
3 ||| Occasionally sinks into ludicrousness, but has enough suspense, chills and surprises to keep avid horror fans viscerally compelled and ultimately satisfied.
3 ||| While laughter may not be the intended entertainment value, you have to admit Orphan does entertain. Isn't that what really counts?
3 ||| This is a poorly directed wannabe horror film that nevertheless contains more laughs than The Proposal, The Ugly Truth, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past and Land of the Lost combined. Is that a compliment? Kind of.
1 ||| Actors have to eat like the rest of us, but you still have to wonder how Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard ended up wading through Orphan and not laughing.
3 ||| So sloppy, so lowdown, so shameless and so entertaining, Orphan provides everything you might expect in a psycho-child thriller, but with such excess and exuberance that it still has the power to surprise.
3 ||| The inclusion of a twist ending that's flat-out jaw-dropping in its audaciousness virtually justifies the entire movie's existence by itself...
1 ||| I'll give this much credit to the movie: I absolutely did not see the twist coming. This is because the twist... is unconscionably f-----g stupid
3 ||| Not too much gore, and just the right amount of terror make this a mind twisting horror movie in the tradition of "Carrie" and "The Omen."
1 ||| As the poster says, 'There's something wrong with Esther.' There certainly is -- she's trapped in this terminally dull and dimwitted movie.
3 ||| I really enjoyed Orphan and enjoyed the fact that the film went to some pretty dark and twisted places.
3 ||| Balancing well-rendered melodrama with some impressively ballsy genre moves, Orphan is more enjoyable trash than it should be. Call it John and Kate Plus Hate.
3 ||| I think that, if someone really wanted to adopt (as my dear parents did), it would take more than a single movie to dissuade them.
3 ||| An exceptional cast, including child actress Isabelle Fuhrman, make Orphan a cut above.
0 ||| ... an angry, bitter and abhorrent display of masochism masquerading around as a legitimate horror film.
1 ||| Check the return policy for this Orphan.
3 ||| If you're not easily offended or upset, there is much to enjoy in Orphan. Horror films this skilfully made don't come along that often. You probably won't find a better one this year.
3 ||| Preposterous in all the right ways, Orphan is this week's true guilty pleasure.
3 ||| Collet-Serra manages to sustain tension throughout, prudently deploying his jumps and jolts and pumping up the grue factor. So while it often prompts hoots of derision, they're often choked off with a vice-tight wince.
3 ||| Orphan is nasty but enjoyable, and the whole film is so competently crafted and superbly acted, especially by the three central females, that I was gripped and entertained throughout.
3 ||| A welcome addition to the Evil Child sub-genre, thanks to great performances, strong direction, a delightfully over-the-top plot, some impressive gore effects and a terrific twist.
4 ||| Daring and fresh, 'Orphan' is easily one of the best horror movies of 2009.
3 ||| Audacious, silly fun.
3 ||| Collet-Serra's film succeeds in being genuinely creepy, is commendably well acted by all concerned, and contains the best twist since The Crying Game.
3 ||| a carefully staged deconstruction of our assumptions about horrorshows about preternaturally manipulative and malevolent children
3 ||| David Johnson's script plays fair with red herrings before a devilish denouement with all the torque of a good twist. Esther doesn't just want to topple the Colemans' house of cards. She wants to torch it, and "Orphan" is gruesome, gripping material.
4 ||| This is the rare fright flick that is actually grounded in some genuine human emotion.
1 ||| Bad Seed-style horror movie is gory and ludicrous.
4 ||| If we could all stop for a moment and think about how excellent and uplifting garbage can be, America would rally around this movie like the treasure it is.
3 ||| Weak adult characters and lame ending aside, Orphan succeeds more often than not, mainly thanks to Fuhrman's performance and Collet-Serra's direction. It's not a fantastic thriller but it's not bad and often far better than it probably should be.
3 ||| If you are a huge fan of the evil kid sub-genre of horror flicks, then this movie is definitely going to be right up your alley.
0 ||| Dump a murderous psycho brat with a corny Russian accent into that troubled mix and you've got a real horror show on your hands. But not a good one.
3 ||| Orphan is refreshing for its skilled execution and genuinely disturbing atmosphere that permeates every scene.
3 ||| A lot of things don't work that well in My Sister's Keeper, a tearjerker adapted from Jodi Picoult's best-seller. But one thing is guaranteed: The movie practically forces you to shed a tear or two.
3 ||| Films that present a moral dilemma and make us consider the unthinkable are as rare as bargain popcorn in the summer. Cassavetes manages that feat and turns this weeper into a keeper.
3 ||| While this little wrencher works, cinematically, perfectly well, the truth is, this one is going to piss off a whole lot of people.
1 ||| Two straight hours of emotional torture porn that is so brutally assaultive in its determination to jerk tears from viewers that it practically leaps off the screen and into their laps in order to get to them quicker.
3 ||| A motion picture of notable sensitivity and beauty, hamstrung emotions kept to a minimum. Tough, touchy, provocative, and exceptionally moving.
3 ||| Keeper, striving to manipulate the audience, goes on a little longer than it should. However, the performances are so true that it's easy to forgive such unneeded, straight-to-the-heartstrings tactics.
3 ||| My Sister's Keeper doesn't pull any punches, and it doesn't tell any lies, and it earns every feeling and thought and memory it brings to the audience.
4 ||| My Sister's Keeper is an immediate audience-grabber.
3 ||| Contrived or not, sad is sad, and My Sister's Keeper will have all but the most cement-hearted reaching for tissue.
3 ||| Given how easily the filmmakers could have cranked up the string section and gone for the quivering lip in soft focus, their restraint is admirable.
4 ||| A film that overcomes an obscenely melodramatic setup to come by its tears honorably.
3 ||| The weepfest movie of the summer, but it has more going for it than that.
4 ||| My Sister's Keeper humanizes vexing questions about medical ethics without sacrificing rattling family drama.
3 ||| Director Nick Cassavetes relies too much on montages with wispy songs about yearning and unicorns, but he gracefully balances the film's multiple viewpoints, which help us understand that the film's issues are not black and white.
3 ||| My Sister's Keeper isn't quite a keeper, but it's a sturdy melodrama that earns those copious tears.
4 ||| With solid performances and an intelligent script, My Sister's Keeper offers a moving and powerfully realistic portrait of a family stalked by tragedy that somehow manages to emerge from crisis battered but intact.
3 ||| An outrageous Lifetime Television courthouse drama, constructed in the artful style of a Sundance drama...
1 ||| My Sister's Keeper has a gutsy premise, but no guts.
3 ||| Tears will be shed as the promised courtroom drama is displaced by other developments - Joan Cusack almost steals the pic as the lachrymose judge who has lost a young daughter herself.
4 ||| ...consistently manages to rise above its similarly-themed, undeniably low-rent brethren...
4 ||| Easily the most poignant picture of the year, achieved without resorting to manipulative soap opera devices.
3 ||| ...a high-class tear-jerker thanks to an intelligent script...sensitive direction...and strong performances...
1 ||| You should consent to having treacle intravenously injected into your system sooner than go to see this Hollywood weepie.
1 ||| With direction this leaden and scripting this ham-fisted, my suspicion is that there will be far too many dry eyes in the house.
3 ||| A very satisfying, if emotionally draining, experience. Needless to say you should take a large box of hankies - + a bottle of water so you can rehydrate afterwards.
1 ||| This medical-ethics drama is like a sustained assault on the tear ducts.
1 ||| This movie cheapens the experience of a family struggling to come to terms with the impending loss of a loved one. Cry? I very nearly did. Just not in the way Cameron probably hoped.
3 ||| The performances are first-rate, with special commendation to Vassilieva in a breakout performance as a teen striving for normalcy in spite of her cancer.
4 ||| Sometimes, a sad story isn't just a manipulative venture that makes you cry. Sometimes, as in 'The Notebook,' it's a tale well told that brings out honest emotions. Sometimes, it's in a movie such as 'My Sister's Keeper.'
3 ||| There is a touch of contrivance to the set-up that is not totally convincing and the film avoids much of the ethical arguments in favour of family drama. But I must admit to being affected.
3 ||| As manufactured Disease of the Week weepies go, Nick Cassavetes's drama based on a Jodi Picoult bestseller, is surprisingly moving.
3 ||| The decision to avoid unnecessary sentimentality defines this film, elevating it to a more thoughtful if a touch less engaging arena, sacrificing emotional escapism for conversation provoking tragedy.
3 ||| [I]ntelligent, moving and even occasionally funny, although you might want to bring along a few tissues just in case.
0 ||| My Sister's Keeper is a committee-approved nerve-snapper that, much like its main character, has been genetically engineered to MAKE! YOU! CRY!
3 ||| Miraculously, we still like Alan and Stu and Phil even as we crack up when they get tazed and beaten. Phillips has pulled off a feat of balance that rivals Cirque du Soleil down the Strip.
3 ||| This tried and true plot line not only works, but works hilariously.
4 ||| ...I think I can safely predict that "The Hangover" will join March's "I Love You Man" as one of the funniest films of the year.
3 ||| Todd Phillips masterfully shows that the combination of unexpected ingredients can create a potent chemistry that elevates a simple premise.
3 ||| Ninety minutes of pure perverse laughter
4 ||| ... Just might be the funniest movie of the decade.
1 ||| You'll laugh three or four times and probably won't remember why.
3 ||| It's so funny it might convince you that sometimes the raunchy journey is worth the laugh-out-loud reward.
4 ||| While I'm not saying you have to be hungover to appreciate The Hangover, having a wild night out before seeing this the next day might enhance this hilarious experience.
3 ||| An energetic jaunt through ribald territory, centered on the theory that some guys just can't handle Vegas.
1 ||| A film so completely stupid and hateful that you get the sense that it was financed by the Atlantic City tourism board as a way of besmirching the good name of their chief competition.
3 ||| Who would have thought? The Hangover is a crude, crass comedy that manages to be smart at the same time - oh, and funny as hell.
3 ||| The Hangover remains unrepentantly irresponsible and hilarious throughout, culminating with what could be the funniest montage ever to grace a picture's end credits. The summer's first sleeper hit has arrived.
3 ||| As goofy and strange as the situations become, we wouldn't have any investment in this sometimes distasteful silliness if we didn't like these guys.
3 ||| The latest in the wave of post-Judd Apatow Bad Lad comedies, The Hangover is rowdy, scurrilous, and, for about three-quarters of its running time, a lot more hilarious than it has any right to be.
3 ||| easily one of the funniest films of the year.
4 ||| Big laughs, tigers, Heather Graham breast-feeding, naked Asian man beating the boys with a tire iron, Mike Tyson singing Phil Collins%u2026 I'm trying, but I'm not finding much to dislike here.
3 ||| Though the film falters toward the end, The Hangover is a side-splitting adventure you'll still be laughing about the morning after.
3 ||| Exactly the shot of drinking-age-and-up comedy the summer needs before the soda-pop PG-13 sticky-sweetness of summer blockbuster season hits.
3 ||| The payoff to the mysteries isn't nearly as interesting as the setup, and the ending of the movie is disappointingly squishy. But while it's riding a hot streak, The Hangover is a rush.
1 ||| As if it wasn't bad enough to be stuck in Las Vegas with these middle-aged misanthropes, The Hangover does the inconceivable disservice of robbing the audience of that elusive sweet spot of GCA usefulness: the drunken escapade.
3 ||| The Hangover instantly has the feel of one for the ages.
4 ||| Now this is what I'm talkin' about. The Hangover is a funny movie, flat out, all the way through. Its setup is funny. Every situation is funny
3 ||| Easily one of the funniest films so far this year.
3 ||| Cooper, Helms and especially Galifianakis find the right tone to give Phillips' Vegas dream world a funny, slightly dangerous appeal.
3 ||| The guilty pleasure comedy hit of the summer has arrived. This could be the breakout role for Galifianakis.
3 ||| It's just funny - pretty much from start to finish, or at least whenever Zach Galifianakis' 'Fat Jesus' is on screen.
4 ||| The script is really a marvel of invention as it finds myriad ways to sink the characters deeper and deeper into the abyss, and this is where many of the film's biggest laughs come into play.
4 ||| Helms, Cooper and Galafianakis are a great comedy trio with each one bringing a different element to the movie.
4 ||| Who knew a Hangover could be so much fun?
3 ||| The Hangover knows its place and plays right to it. If you see this movie, you'll probably be offended and definitely be disturbed, but you'll also laugh quite a bit.
3 ||| By the end of the film, these guys are our pals.
3 ||| It's a dizzying array of bawdy set pieces buoyed by a eclectic cast.
3 ||| It's a non-stop laugh riot that's destined to become a comedy classic.
3 ||| There is a sort of perverse brilliance or brilliant perverseness to be found in this story of a bachelor party gone terribly wrong.
3 ||| Memento meets Old School? It's party time.
3 ||| If there is any justice in the universe, The Hangover will make Zach Galifianakis a household name.
3 ||| Every summer needs at least one silly, dirty comedy, but The Hangover may end up being one of the few to actually get the mix right.
3 ||| Much smarter than it needs to be and darker than you'd expect, The Hangover seems destined to be the big comedy of the summer.
3 ||| The Hangover is a cut above the typical contemporary guy-friendship comedy.
4 ||| You're likely to hear all about it as friends and co-workers endlessly quote lines or re-create scenes.
3 ||| The funniest movie so far this year.
3 ||| The Hangover should be a huge hit this summer for laugh-starved audiences; happily, it delivers.
3 ||| A strong cast, a quirky script with some unexpected twists and a steady hand from the director's chair make this a desert ride on the wild side a worthy road trip.
0 ||| With The Hangover Todd Phillips has officially become the Uwe Boll of comedy.
1 ||| A glib, drab, fatally unfunny study in mean-spirited mediocrity. Goes down about as easily as Benadryl spiked with tequila.
3 ||| Raunchy and ruthlessly naughty, it's all buzz, no headache.
4 ||| If I had enough money, I would be willing to pay anyone back if they saw this movie and did not like it.
3 ||| Phillips, with a script credited to Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (and with loads of loose-limbed interpretations from the cast), captures the amity among a group of grown men set loose without spouses, girlfriends, or sobriety to hinder them. (Or help.)
3 ||| The Hangover is sure to make moviegoers laugh so hard that their heads will hurt (in a good way, of course).
4 ||| The Hangover ain't art, but Phillips has shaped the hardcore hilarity into the summer party movie of all our twisted dreams.
3 ||| Comedies this good don't happen by accident, even if a little organization could have made The Hangover much better than what it is.
3 ||| A great buddy flick that could be the surprise hit of the summer.
3 ||| The film also develops in a way that although over-the-top feels grounded in a recognisable reality.
3 ||| Unlike most so-called "comedies," this one can claim the virtue of being reasonably funny.
3 ||| Unlike last years rather uninspiring What Happens in Vegas, the hysterical The Hangover actually ends up doing Sin City proud.
4 ||| The plot climaxes in what could be the best credit roll outtakes in movie history. If not that, they certainly rank as one of the best-ever punch lines.
4 ||| Just as a marriage is built on love and promises kept, so can a bromance. "The Hangover" honors and cherishes that idea in slickness and stealth, and will have audiences unsure of how to say Zach Galifianakis but certain he's a star.
3 ||| Vulgar, obscene and offensive, The Hangover is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a very long time and is surely destined to become a comedy classic.
3 ||| There is a lull toward the end, where you almost become as exhausted as the boys on the trip. But (and I rarely say this) thank goodness for those end credits.
3 ||| While its boisterous fun has strong libidinous overtones, it never takes the plunge into full, frothing raunch.
3 ||| There are people who will not find this film amusing. Amish elders. Infants. An Iowan farmer named Burl. And that should cover it. The rest of you: bring a change of underwear.
3 ||| If there's a problem with 'The Hangover' (and other films of its ilk), it's the at best ambivalent, at worst hostile relationship to women...
4 ||| the kind of brilliant comedy that will have you gasping, laughing so hard you'll have tears in your eyes.
3 ||| It gets the job done thanks in large part to the breakout performance given by Galifianakis.
3 ||| Stands up as a motion picture in addition to working as a delivery system for gags... as fine a mystery and character study as it is a comedy.
3 ||| What makes any film work, and this is particularly true of comedy, is making it real, even though everything we're seeing is completely unbelievable. I laughed a lot with this one.
4 ||| Hangover shows no mercy in its quest for laughs.
4 ||| The best bachelor party movie since, well, "Bachelor Party"
0 ||| To call it 'atrocious' and 'loathsome' is to pussyfoot around the truth.
4 ||| Pushing the envelope unlike anything the industry has offered us this year; "The Hangover" provides the escape factor. Prepare for the wild ride!
3 ||| Consistently funny, The Hangover proves you don't need a big-name Hollywood cast to get big laughs. Destined to appeal to the lads everywhere, that the film doesn't only resort to gross-out gags means female audiences should give it a go.
3 ||| It turns out to be every bit as crass, offensive and incorrect as you'd expect, but it's also - gulp! - really very funny an awful lot of the time, as well as bizarrely gripping.
3 ||| Everything works here; the characters are funny, the set-ups are funny, the lines are funny.
3 ||| The Hangover amounts to a gut-bustingly funny boy's own comedy.
3 ||| Debauched, depraved and very, very funny.
3 ||| The cracking script - a veritable treasure trove of smart one-liners - and beautifully-worked setpieces make this one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year.
3 ||| Succeeding equally well as rowdy romp, what-happened mystery and man-crush comedy, /The Hangover/ is an unexpected winner.
4 ||| With a great soundtrack and script so sharp you might need to take plasters into the cinemas with you because you might come out with cuts... this is this summer's must see comedy.
4 ||| Rude, crude and defiantly male, it's the ultimate phallocentric antidote to Sex And The City, and easily the funniest American comedy of the year.
3 ||| Lewd, crude and exceptionally rude, the gags come thick and fast.
3 ||| A devilishly smart comedy gem that manages to blend the raunchy and the rowdy with some deliciously left-field humour.
3 ||| A furiously paced, inventive and flat-out hilarious take on a tried-and-tested formula. An exemplary bromantic comedy that doesn't sacrifice heart in pursuit of laughs, maintaining plenty of the former and a superabundance of the latter.
3 ||| Rude, crude and downright distasteful - this film is brilliant.
3 ||| Some very funny, very non-PC dialogue is thrown about like a game of catch. The actors, virtually unknown, are terrific.
3 ||| A wee-inducingly funny bromance.
3 ||| Easily the funniest film of the year. A must-see.
3 ||| Hugely enjoyable and frequently hilarious, this is a sharply written comedy with strong comic performances from a terrific ensemble cast.
3 ||| It's not very sophisticated, but this raucous comedy keeps us laughing with its sheer absurdity. The characters are very well-played and their interaction is genuinely hilarious, even if most of the jokes are pretty cheap.
3 ||| This is top stuff. There's all the carnage, baps and humiliation you could want from a 15-rated comedy but it's pegged around a smart plot that actually holds up. Take out the laughs, and The Hangover would still work as a gripping, if barmy thriller.
3 ||| The comedy is consistently funny and the cast? Well, they're hardly A-list, but therein lies the magic as they're all hugely likeable and pair that with a funny script and you get guaranteed entertainment.
3 ||| It kicks this sub-genre up a gear with an anarchic sense of fun and a consistently high gags-to-giggle ratio that knows when to push the envelop of taste and when to pull back a little.
3 ||| It is sometimes coarse, and there are some scurrilous scenes. But this is an inventive, funny, entertaining movie.
3 ||| "The Hangover" will induce headaches - from laughter.
3 ||| If only real hangovers were this much fun.
4 ||| 'The Hangover' is an outrageous, entertaining, laugh-out-loud classic from beginning to end.
4 ||| Who knew that we needed a 'Dude, Where's My Car?' for grownups?
3 ||| The director and his screenwriters have come up with the funniest film to appear in ages. It avoids the predictable crudity and silly laddishness (well, almost) you'd expect, and delights with zinging one-liners and charming performances.
1 ||| Comedies have rarely been as lazy as this, nor have they been so adamantly stupid.
3 ||| Galifianakis is a revelation of wrong.
3 ||| My only complaint about The Hangover is that so many excellent moments were ruined by the preview. The Hangover, particularly Ed Helms, is very funny. Don't bring a family member and don't try any of this at home.
3 ||| It is classless, it is tasteless, it is idiotic, it is juvenile and it is something your mother totally wouldn't approve of. But it also is flat-out hilarious.
3 ||| A comedy binge-fest you won't regret in the morning.
1 ||| You'd have to be drunk...
3 ||| O mais surpreendente  o cuidado com que o roteiro desenvolve seus trs personagens principais.
3 ||| Leave the kids at home, round up a group of guys and head out to the theater for a good time.
4 ||| The raucous, raunchy laughs are indeed plentiful and the gags often outrageous, but what really drives the film is the unpredictability of the script.
3 ||| Quite entertaining as an entry in this tried-and-true genre of "guys going on a inadvertent wacky adventure," and I like how this one is set up as a kind of mystery.
3 ||| Todd Philips, who wrote and directed Road Trip and Old Scool, wrote Borat, and even plays the coked out Israeli dude in the elevator in The Hangover, has had his finger on the pulse of modern comedy cinema for a decade.
3 ||| Bachelor Party meets Dude, Where's My Car (and about as entertaining as the two of them averaged together.)
3 ||| A fun time is had watching these three men piece together a night that never was, something of an old school detective story mixed with a heavy dose of adult humour. Better comedies have been released, yet not many as brazen as The Hangover.
4 ||| The Hangover might not be top class indie pop art, but the film represents the best of what comedy can provide -- pure, unadulterated, slaphappy entertainment. And there's nothing wrong with that.
3 ||| I highly recommend going into this film blind, just to keep some of the surprises from being ruined. Oh, and being a 21-year-old male will also really help you to enjoy this flick.
3 ||| Just when you think things can't get any more farcical, they do: The Hangover is the Crank of comedy.
4 ||| The kind of brilliant comedy that will have you gasping, laughing so hard you'll have tears in your eyes and rocking back in your chair from laughter.
3 ||| Though it looks like just another men-will-be-guys-will-be-boys-will-be-idiots affair, this well-scripted affair still stands up as a refreshingly unpredictable laugh machine.
3 ||| Galifianakis went from being an alt-comedy idol to a mainstream pop culture figure. The Hangover still feels like a breath of fresh air.
4 ||| What happens in Vegas is very funny, indeed.
0 ||| if you can think past the thirty second mark, the house of cards that is the script dissolves faster than cotton candy in the rain
1 ||| [Nelson] McCormick has crafted a horror remake so undistinguished it makes Prom Night look like a masterpiece of transgressive filmmaking.
1 ||| The Stepfather is studio-produced drivel that puts a negative label on horror movies and psychological chillers. The only pleasure to be had from watching it is to so easily be able to pick it apart.
1 ||| Comparing the original to this one is like comparing regular basketball to donkey basketball--a perfectly good thing has been needlessly "improved" by making everything bigger and dumber and by allowing a bunch of jackasses to dump all over it.
1 ||| There are some movies that should not be re-made. This is one of them, as proven by this updated, cliche-filled version which fails to build up the necessary tension and truncates the mystery.
3 ||| The Stepfather is that rarity, an effective remake of a screen classic that can stand alone on its own considerable merits.
1 ||| A clumsy remake of the 1987 cult thriller.
1 ||| a shameless exercise in promoting the lowest common denominator
0 ||| What is there to be said about this utterly worthless, addle-brained waste of 101 minutes except that it's an utterly worthless, addle-brained waste of 101 minutes?
1 ||| Not so much a contemporary re-make of Joseph Ruben's 1987 psychological thriller as a lobotomised bastard step-child: over-plotted, over-long, and stripped of the original's sharp, satirical subversion of suburban family values.
1 ||| Nelson McCormick is ridiculously lax with inventive or plausible staging: it's the kind of movie where a door can't open without thunderclaps and the bad guy flinging himself into the frame.
1 ||| This rehash - toned (and dumbed) down for adolescent audiences by the director responsible for taking the slash out of Prom Night - provides thin gruel.
1 ||| Mercilessly talky and deathly dull, this bloodless, sex-less misfire plays more like a housewife-baiting telemovie than the taut, teen-centric psycho-thriller it's supposed to be.
1 ||| A pointless, dumbed-down remake of a slasher movie of the same name.
1 ||| Any subtlety or implicit social satire to be found in Joseph Ruben's original went out with the last neighborhood trash pickup. Too bad the service was canceled before it could haul away this waste-of-time remake. [Blu-ray]
0 ||| What a shame that the remake fell into the unwieldy hands of the same jokers responsible for last year's execrable Prom Night redo.
1 ||| Walsh's performance as David is so limp that it's difficult to imagine David outwitting any of his victims in the film.
3 ||| A sumptuous, richly composed drama that considers big, broad emotional issues with a sweeping cinematic canvas.
3 ||| It feels like a singularly great film when one understands its plot as a daringly paradoxical apologia for Japan's moribund taboo.
4 ||| This is truly masterful and glorious filmmaking that's guaranteed a spot in my Top 10 of the year.
4 ||| An exquisite cinematic masterpiece that is both funny and sad and all the emotions in between; it touches the heart with its treatment of beauty, music, death, and abandonment.
3 ||| Multiplexes are crowded with noisy summer films, from which Departures will represent a sophisticated and elegant departure.
4 ||| The plot involves some developments we can see coming, but they seem natural, inevitable. The music is lush and sentimental in a subdued way, the cinematography is perfectly framed and evocative, and the movie is uncommonly absorbing.
3 ||| This Oscar winning film about death is actually a joyous hymn to life.
4 ||| A tremendously moving experience filled with warmth, wisdom, intelligence and tenderness sprinkled with just the right dash of humor to balance the heaviness and keeps you thoroughly enthralled.
3 ||| Takita is blessed with actors who move lightly, gracefully within this landscape.
3 ||| The film is far from perfect but has enough going on to compensate for its excessive length and some sentimentality.
4 ||| Though events unravel predictably, the film is profoundly affecting, thanks to a well-written story, rich characters and superlative acting.
4 ||| Fully deserving of every ounce of gold on its Oscar, Departures' amazing achievement is in being a film about death that is so truly beautiful, joyful and life-affirming.
3 ||| Departures is such an elegant, beautifully mounted meditation on death, funeral customs and parent-child relations that you may find yourself sniffling and resisting simultaneously.
3 ||| Yojiro Takita's movie simultaneously tickles tears of mourning as it wrings laughs about the meaning of life.
3 ||| Despite its Hollywood-friendliness, Departures never seems less than an utterly sincere, four-hankie movie about finding oneself.
3 ||| Departures quietly subverts aesthetic and emotional expectations. There are moments where the story could turn maudlin or veer into bad taste, but the high-minded intent is never lost.
3 ||| It is the type of film that needs some time to find its story and its characters. This thoughtful drama is pretty rewarding, though the very deliberate tempo may test the patience of some.
3 ||| There is nothing so sparkling to this film at first glance. It's a film about man's mortality and how he handles it, but death is not cleverly hidden inside a bigger story. It's a wake-up slap in the face about the gritty part of dying: the bodies.
4 ||| Departures is a loving tribute to the Japanese way of death.
3 ||| The winning nature of the performances outweighs Takita's more obvious choices.
3 ||| Departures is sometimes macabre and sometimes manipulative, but the way it speaks to the spirit is miraculous.
3 ||| A compassionate and wry character study of a man who, finding himself at a crossroads, is reborn through death.
4 ||| One of the best movies released this year, it will be included on my year-end top 10 list. This movie has a personal touch that never wears out its welcome...
4 ||| Absolutely, beautifully, tear duct openingly right.
3 ||| The ending, which involves a rock, would wring tears from a stone.
3 ||| Redeems a trite 'redemptive' story about family with hushed, beautifully staged sequences of 'encoffinment'...
3 ||| The film's tone lies, appropriately, somewhere between life, death, and the inadvertent humor that comes from finally accepting the yin/yang perfection of both and getting on with what comes between.
4 ||| A surprisingly uplifting examination of life and loss.
3 ||| Departures is a great film and, yes, you're going to need your reading glasses -- this one is subtitled.
4 ||| The film seduces us into this world with such affection and beauty.
3 ||| Beautifully acted and classically filmed, Departures is a gentle, wise, immensely appealing film.
3 ||| Takita eventually pushes the emotions too hard but by then I had lost all resistance. It's a beautiful film but take two hankies.
4 ||| Heart-warming, funny, wise and profound. Not to be missed.
3 ||| Doesn't quite justify the enormous plaudits heaped upon its shoulders, but a warm-hearted comedy-drama with its own likeably odd sensibility.
3 ||| Departures's whimsical take on the Japanese funeral industry proves surprisingly funny.
3 ||| Departure's cynicism, ironically, is what makes the optimism of its last act so moving.
3 ||| A sentimental but beguiling charmer of a film.
3 ||| In the end, it's powerfully moving, and perhaps a bit too nice.
4 ||| Director Yojiro Takita and writer Kundo Kayama ... aren't afraid to give you an emotional punch as well as a punchline.
3 ||| Lead Masahiro Motoki apprenticed with real nakanshi for the role, and you become entranced by his performance, and the gentle clash of ritual and grief, custom and modernity.
4 ||| Death is normal, and so are responsibilities, reconciliations and retreats from what we think are our dreams. In a resolution about identifying ourselves, and loved ones, in life and death, "Departures" shows some people must be left just as they went.
3 ||| The laughter and family fights that break out at funerals might be part of this movie's rural, working-class eye. Departures favors farmland and old-fashioned wood-fired bathhouses over the Tokyo mania. It celebrates old-style, hands-on craft.
4 ||| All three actors are skilled in communicating difficult emotions just with their faces and in bringing to life the gentle humor that leavens this very affecting movie about death and letting go.
3 ||| A charming, winning piece of filmmaking that, while in no way deserving of the title of Best Foreign Language film of this or any year, is a heartwarming and bittersweet tale that hits all the right notes.
3 ||| Small but sharp and extremely well observed.
3 ||| This is a tough, shrewd, intelligent movie.
3 ||| Superbly acted, sharply observed and impressively directed Romanian drama, though it drags a little in the early stages.
1 ||| Ballerina has the feel of a propaganda puff piece put out by the Russian tourist board.
3 ||| Ballerina will be of interest mostly to balletomanes, but even folks who don't know their right foot from their left will find inspiration in the lives of these devoted dancers. Besides, who isn't moved by Swan Lake?
3 ||| The movie is an admirable look into the venerable St. Petersburg company and how dancers thrive or just survive in the physically challenging world of dance.
3 ||| Dance aficionados will be sent over the moon by this compelling documentary from director Bertrand Norman, chronicling what it takes to be a prima ballerina in the Mariinski Theatre.
3 ||| This rare, behind-the-scenes dance film, which is more a profile of dancers than of the dance, shows that Russia and its famed Kirow are still the world's core of ballet.
3 ||| Behind-the-curtains has never been more ravishing nor more rewarding
0 ||| Great song. Bad movie.
0 ||| The first reveal of Nicolas Cage sporting a blond wig with ringlets that makes him look like a Shirley Temple drag queen impersonator after a post-medieval-party-themed blackout is the sort of fright probably not intended by its makers.
1 ||| Directed by the perennially hollow Dominic Sena from a script by Bragi Schut, "Season of the Witch" is all seams. It never balances out its competing desires...
1 ||| It's part fairy tale-gone-wrong, part recycled legend, part panto horror. Think The Wolfman, or Van Helsing, only worse.
1 ||| Did either Cage or Sena even bother reading Bragi F. Schut's patchwork script, before adjusting the wig, flicking on the camera and cashing the pay cheques?
1 ||| There are almost no laughs to be had in Season of the Witch. That's unfortunate, because the only chance that this overproduced yet still shoddy piece of early-January multiplex fodder had of being entertaining was as an unintentional comedy classic.
1 ||| Disappointing, sluggishly directed medieval thriller with poor special effects, a plot that manages to be both dull and nonsensical and not even a bonkers performance from Cage to liven things up.
1 ||| It's The Seventh Seal meets Get Him to the Greek meets Lord of the Rings as if filtered through Uwe Boll's hack-tastic brain.
1 ||| I couldn't shake the feeling that it might have been conceived and filmed as a comedy, then edited so that it plays like a thriller.
1 ||| more like a troubled nap than a compelling flick
1 ||| Season of the Witch is as bloodless as a starved vampire. Instead of a review, it deserves a stake in the heart.
1 ||| It'll come as little surprise to anyone who follows Cage's career that he's picked yet another dud. Yes, after Knowing, Bangkok Dangerous, G-Force and Next, the follically-challenged actor has done it again.
1 ||| Rather than elevating this wanna-be Hammer horror flick, Cage somehow lowers its quality.
0 ||| The scariest thing about Season of the Witch is the movie itself, an abomination of bad filmmaking and terrible acting.
1 ||| Cage's old pal Dominic Sena is a decade removed from their "Gone in 60 Seconds" directing glory, and he gets nothing out of this script that isn't pure hokum.
1 ||| You've seen more convincing medieval performances from guys at Ye Olde Pancake House after a LARP scrimmage. With all the dead birds and fish, this might seem like a timely piece of apocalyptic fiction. But such pestilence is annual par for Nicolas Cage.
1 ||| Disregards characters, emotions and even dramatic tension in favour of an endless parade of 'cool shit' to impress its perceived audience of 13 year olds.
3 ||| While certainly no Witchfinder General, it doesn't deserve to be burned at the stake.
1 ||| A cursed abomination...as a priest observes, 'We're going to need more holy water!'
1 ||| Dominic Sena directs all this stuff and nonsense with a paucity of fun unbecoming a loopy tale of medieval witches starring Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman.
0 ||| This painfully earnest and overblown medieval swords-and-sorcery road movie is unlikely to warm the cockles of any but the most die-hard fans of Cage's stentorian growl and arch overacting.
1 ||| Nicolas Cage=Modern Day Bela Lugosi in Declining Years
1 ||| Watching it you can't escape the feeling that Hollywood executives were constantly hovering telling Sena to add more CGI here, less character development there and all-in-all doing their best to royally screw things up.
1 ||| Avoid it -- wait for it -- like the Black Plague.
1 ||| It's amazing how little entertainment value there is in watching Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman play world-weary Crusaders in a movie called Season Of The Witch. Come on! It's Ghost Rider and Hellboy!
1 ||| Although I will likely be disemboweled from my toes to my nose (metaphorically speaking only, I hope) for this proclamation, I didn't think Season of the Witch was all that bad!*
1 ||| After a while, the movie tires of the witch business and trots out a plot twist that permits the effects department to spend money.
1 ||| The best thing that can be said about Season of the Witch is that this season ends in 98 minutes and I never have to live through it again.
4 ||| If you step aboard Shuttle, be prepared for one heck of a ride filled with suspense, action and ever-escalating terror. With this ingenious thriller, Edward Anderson, who wrote the heist flick Flawless, makes an audacious directorial debut.
1 ||| a pile of stinking turpitude
4 ||| One hell of a terrifying ride ...
3 ||| Shuttle mostly exists, in the words of Alfred Hitchcock, to 'put the audience through it,' but it leaves you in a very different place than where it started and with remarkable economy of effort.
3 ||| A slightly prosaic and tedious, but mostly chilly and intense ride.
1 ||| There is no release for the audience, no 'entertainment,' not even much action excitement. Just a remorseless march into the dark.
3 ||| Hop aboard this Shuttle if you're in the mood for one unsettling ride.
1 ||| This Playboy fantasy farce is one of those painful comedies in which the strain to be funny shows -- always.
1 ||| Moore is so offensive to all the senses that you spend all ninety minutes of the movie intensely wishing to punch him in the face.
3 ||| The best mainstream comedy so far this year. Every time you start thinking how you've seen it all before, you find yourself laughing too hard to care.
1 ||| When it comes time to wheel Hefner out for his cameo, even he seems irritated by these guys.
1 ||| uses its R rating as perhaps an eight-year-old would: to drop the F-bomb constantly and to show poop.
0 ||| Dude, like the only purpose of this film is to like coarsen society, use gutter language, and appeal to the lowest intellect possible. That's like awesome, Dude.
1 ||| A witless hodgepodge of gross-out gags that by comparison makes last summer's 'The House Bunny' look like 'Citizen Kane'.
1 ||| Road trip raunchfest is ridiculously awful.
1 ||| When the movie was going to come out a month ago, it was called Miss February. Then the release date changed, and so did the title. Now it's Miss March. Miss This would have been more helpful.
0 ||| My blood runs cold at the memory of Miss March, a 90-minute rip-off of the J. Geils Band song Centerfold whose multi-hyphenate creators prove themselves actor-director-writer-failures.
1 ||| The funniest thing about the monumentally stupid anti-comedy Miss March is that somehow the producers convinced Playboy to sign off on the thing.
0 ||| The month is irrelevant; Miss March would be a dog no matter where it fell on the calendar.
1 ||| Cregger and Moore not only star in "Miss March," they wrote and directed it too, which seems like a selfless act akin to throwing yourself on a live grenade, protecting any innocent careers around you from getting hit by flying shrapnel.
0 ||| The movie operates mainly on a crippling fear of human sexuality, female sexuality, females in general, black people, lesbians and just about everything else.
0 ||| So awful as to make heterosexual men actively loathe Playboy.
1 ||| Overall a raggedy, unfocused affair that wastes both directors' acting talent and feels like too much work between the laughs.
1 ||| Miss March caters so heavily to its juvenile audience it forgets the actual humans who should have been at the center of the story.
1 ||| The whole thing left me bored, and if I'd have remembered to wear a watch I'm sure I'd have looked at it a half dozen times waiting for the torture to end.
0 ||| We're the country that gave the world jazz and abstract expressionism and Orson Welles. We invented basketball and hip-hop. Now we export adolescent comedy garbage and hope the world won't notice.
0 ||| A relentlessly insulting and offensive flick which endeavors to redeem itself via 11th-hour moralizing ony after every frame up to the end had been a wholesale celebration of the debasement of females and the stereotyping of blacks.
0 ||| Forget waterboarding -- just show Guantanamo detainees Miss March and they'll say anything.
1 ||| The movie's aiming for the drunken college crowd but most of the gags have the nervous, giggly idiocy of two middle-school kids flipping through dad's Playboy.
0 ||| I know it's early but this one is already a prime contender for worst movie of the year
0 ||| Millions of brain cells committed suicide last Friday when exposed to Miss March.
1 ||| Cregger and Moore...are a pair of genuine triple-threats: They can't write, they can't direct, and they're not funny.
0 ||| Here's a movie that isn't fit to debut on the big screen.
1 ||| Miss March does not have much to offer aside from nudity and sexist humor.
1 ||| The boys directed and co-scripted, so there's no one else to blame.
1 ||| Abysmal, laugh-free and frequently offensive comedy whose one or two original ideas are completely overshadowed by smutty, puerile gags and a plot that's so insultingly sexist that you wonder if it's part of an elaborate prank.
1 ||| A crude, crass, virtually laugh-free sex comedy.
1 ||| If this film were as racist as it is sexist (which it very nearly is), it would be a buddy movie about the madcap antics of two Klan members on a lynching spree. Appalling. If we could give it zero out of five, we would.
0 ||| Miss March must be a contender for worst film of the year. It's so poor that you begin to suspect it's a pastiche.
1 ||| A whiff of what I can only describe as pure evil billows off the screen while this comedy is playing: a buddy grossout picture with zero laughs and a persistent, chilling misogyny.
0 ||| An almost perfect atrocity. It is a towering K2 of bobbins... the most mangy, noxious, charmless, sexist, racist, unfunny, infantile, stomach-turning, grotesque, clueless, inept and stupid film of the year.
1 ||| Nothing works. Nothing comes close to working. Even other people's ideas that work in their own films don't work here.
0 ||| A teen sex comedy that isn't sexy or comic - talk about dumb and dumber...
1 ||| So moronic that even plankton would tut at its ignorance.
1 ||| A dire gross-out comedy that tackles many of the same themes as Adventureland but without an ounce of subtlety or wit.
1 ||| This "comedy" might be the Worst Movie Ever Seen, even with the aftershock of the Wayans Bros' Dance Flick still lingering.
1 ||| You'd have to be drunk, 12 years old or witless really want to see this. Hopefully not all three.
3 ||| Definitely worth seeing if you like a good gross-out film/ sex comedy.
0 ||| An unholy genre mutation undreamt of on the isle of Dr. Moreau, An American Affair piggybacks the pubescent sexual awakening sapfest onto the JFK assassination conspiracy thriller.
1 ||| If you can get past the exploitation-of-minors thing, there's a tawdry exuberance to moments like the one in which the twerp and his overage girlfriend drunkenly splash paint on each other.
1 ||| Sketchily written, clumsily directed and poorly acted, even history-conspiracy aficionados will be left cold.
3 ||| A flick for Kennedy assassination conspiracy buffs which puts a whole new spin on "the grassy knoll" courtesy of the flamboyance of a nearly-naked Gretchen Mol.
1 ||| An implausible drama about some Washington D.C. people plotting around the time of the assassination of JFK.
3 ||| A captivating, witty and poignant drama. Gretchen Mol sizzles.
1 ||| Before An American Affair is over, you can be sure that Adam will learn a very familiar life lesson.
1 ||| so absurd and convoluted that even JFK's legacy can't subdue its preposterousness
4 ||| Covers the three essential bases of indie horror: It's scary, it's smart, and it pushes a few boundaries. An excellent debut for Paul Solet.
3 ||| Little details like these make the film a valuable contribution to the genre. Likewise, the treatment of female characters and themes, while not perfect, is welcome.
3 ||| Like Bug or Audition, Grace will imprint its uniquely grotesque imagery onto your cerebrum, then dare you to shake it off.
4 ||| Grace is very much the antidote to what plagues most of the horror genre today. It will restore your faith that there is still an artistic vision within the horror genre.
1 ||| There's a pervasive and unintentional Raimian sensibility to Grace, writer-director Paul Solet's feature debut, that thoroughly undermines its Polanskian underpinnings.
4 ||| Grace is a truly horrifying movie.
1 ||| Paul Solet's gyno-horror flick is certainly twisted but only slightly unnerving; the movie is about as gripping as one might expect given that its infant monster is both mute and cradle-bound.
3 ||| Deeply unsettling stuff ... [but] sharp, witty and ambitiously artful too, like some lost gem from the highbrow spectrum of '70s exploitation cinema
3 ||| "Grace" isn't really a horror movie, but it's gruesome and unsettling. The story could easily have been turned into low-budget genre trash; but first-time feature director Paul Solet maintains iron control of the wild material. Clearly, this is a guy to k
3 ||| It's a horrifying meditation on the unbreakable union of mother and child.
3 ||| The sickest and most disturbing movie you'll see this year, extremely effective on every level without cowtowing to the overused formulas that have become standard in modern horror.
4 ||| It is a true original, and unlike all those remakes and retreads this is one movie that truly knows what scares you.
3 ||| you may never look at a baby sound monitor the same way.
4 ||| Grace very well could be the movie you need to see to restore your faith in the idea that there is still an artistic vision within the horror genre.
4 ||| An inspirational tale chronicling the contributions of a few unseen players in the South African struggle for independence.
3 ||| ...crafts a crackling thriller out of the tangle of crafty maneuvering that ended apartheid.
1 ||| The Red Baron is like Le Grande Illusion remade by a German porn director. Never in the field of human film-making was so much money wasted on so little.
3 ||| An ambitious young man in his flying machine
3 ||| A bleak adventure flick and a very sweaty psychological thriller.
3 ||| Director Daniel Myrick has taken his excellent work from the ultra-low-budget "Blair Witch Hunt," added some modest resources as befits that success and come up with a great little tale of suspense and horror.
3 ||| Even with its uber-clichd last five minutes, The Objective may be one of the smartest horror movies this year.
3 ||| Still, it's the shivers that count, and while Myrick may not make our spine tingle like he did back in the late '90s...The Objective is still an impressive piece of work
3 ||| In this year's crop of Oscar-nominated shorts, the animated category beats the live-action offerings.
0 ||| Succeeds only at suggesting the incompatibility of returning-home dramedy and surrealistic flights of fancy.
1 ||| Not even the reliable Posey can salvage this slag heap, and fans of the iconic Indiewood starlet -- Poseyphiles? Parkerheads? -- will be especially crestfallen.
1 ||| A vulgar, happy-as-cancer aberration that takes the dysfunctional family idea to a new low. Whimsical, yes. Happy, never.
3 ||| In the role of a dialed-down, capable woman, Demi Moore suggests dramatic possibilities for future roles. She projects a kind of calm, and it's attractive.
1 ||| A cringe-inducing, self-consciously kooky indie comedy that's best enjoyed for its taste of Rip Torn, who, judging by his recent alleged bank break-in, comes to loose-cannon stuff naturally.
1 ||| one of those awkwardly pretentious attempts to seem hip and profound by simply depicting people acting really goofy
3 ||| Demi Moore and Parker Posey play polar-opposite sisters dealing with their aging father (Rip Torn) who's showing signs of senility, soiling himself and shacking up with his "nurse" (Ellen Barkin).
3 ||| Sluggish, stylized and frequently washed in a bilious green tint, The Missing Person is yet oddly irresistible, its omnipresent anxiety like a musical chord that neither rises nor falls.
3 ||| "So you make jokes and smoke cigarettes," a lady in the murk summarizes. Yeah. Isn't that enough?
3 ||| The Missing Person isn't merely a clever, cool spin on the classic private eye story, but it also works as a private eye story. It showcases a lurching, hunched, quietly lived-in performance by Shannon but offers more than just that performance. ...
3 ||| It's a great-looking movie, with an evocative use of music and, in rugged-yet-sensitive Michael Shannon, has an actor whose forceful, focused presence is the film's sturdy linchpin.
3 ||| Michael Shannon adds another stunning performance to his resume with this small-scale neo-noir by writer/director Noah Buschel.
3 ||| There's a pretty good film if you give writer-director Noah Buschel a chance. The 31-year-old crafts a convincing noir tale, with a sense of realism that makes the experience pleasingly voyeuristic.
3 ||| Most of it is admittedly a lot of fun, especially when the characters come out intriguingly sideways.
1 ||| It's clear from Polanski's cramped frames that [director] Chapa knows as little about filmmaking as he does his subject.
1 ||| To describe the film as this generation's "Wired" hardly begins to scratch the surface. This is a movie so bad that the people who actually made "Wired" can actually look down upon it without coming across as hypocritical.
1 ||| Ambitious in an obsessive, stalkerish sort of way, Damian Chapa(TM)s low-budget biopic of Roman Polanski is avowedly empathetic and thus not a complete hatchet job.
3 ||| It's an easy movie to snipe at, but its quest for authenticity, even in its most affluent characters, is honorable.
3 ||| Moodysson actually really loves his characters and wants them to be happy, rather than putting stock characters though a series of heavily predictable trials and tribulations on the way to a forced happy ending.
3 ||| Focuses on the strong and universal desire of both the rich and the poor for a loving connection with their children and the obstacles which can hinder that intimacy.
3 ||| a remarkably subtle exploration of family in a time of capitalism
1 ||| The overlapping stories, the emotional disconnect, the heavy-handed symbolism -- no, it's not a movie from the makers of Babel, its a mumbling, stammering copycat drama from Swedish director Lukas Moodysson.
3 ||| Less obsessed with coincidence and more interested in the ways people from various cultures connect, or don't quite connect, in everyday situations.
3 ||| There are so many reasons to be outraged and depressed by this film, indeed, that it all but distracts from the real and immediate qualities of the four fine actors.
3 ||| Mammoth is a masterclass in feel-bad cinema.
1 ||| [A] fatuous, self-serving and fantastically dishonest exercise in pseudo-compassion, composed in the supercilious "globalised" style of Alejandro Gonzlez Iarritu's 2006 film Babel.
1 ||| As woolly and elephantine as its title.
4 ||| A well-balanced and thought-provoking documentary that doesn't forget the cinema-going experience needs to entertain as well as educate.
3 ||| Crude is both a tribute to human-rights tenacity and a sobering account of the multinational-Moloch greed that can keep justice in limbo.
3 ||| Keeps a tight focus on a sprawling topic, condensing three years of production into a narrative that neatly lays out the history of the controversy, the opposing viewpoints and key players
3 ||| Mr. Berlinger has both a strong narrative instinct and a keen eye for incongruous, evocative and powerful images.
3 ||| Berlinger gives a good amount of time to the big oil representatives, but it's clear that he's on the side of the people. Aside from that, Crude is a fine work of journalism.
3 ||| Embedded in the story are enough intriguing characters and moments of high human drama for it to function more like a piece of effective fiction than a work of overwrought agitprop.
4 ||| A provocative, well-balanced, illuminating and thoroughly engrossing documentary.
3 ||| A dynamic and dramatic documentary about the David vs. Goliath dimensions of the "Amazon Chernobyl" case where indigenous tribal groups are fighting the multinational corporation Chevron.
4 ||| Here's a powerhouse of a documentary that makes you feel mad as hell and unwilling to take it anymore.
4 ||| A heart-wrenching, alarming and brilliantly crafted documentary about Chevron's desecration of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and the 27-billion dollar law suit in which indigenous peoples seek remediation and justice.
3 ||| No film could convey all the complexities of the case -- what Crude does is air the plaintiffs' claims and show the lawyers at work.
4 ||| Powerful and powerfully upsetting.
3 ||| Looking for another reason to leave your car at home? Go see Crude.
3 ||| A legal thriller, it's a three-year investigation into the disaster environmentalists call the "Amazonian Chernobyl" that offers both sides of the story and leaves the viewer in the position of jury.
3 ||| It will certainly remain in your mind the next time you stop for gas.
3 ||| Crude has all the hallmarks of a John Grisham story - sharp lawyers, raw greed, Big Business behaving badly. The difference is that this David-vs.-Goliath story is no work of fiction.
3 ||| Berlinger provides a bracing and intelligent look at how such battles are (and perhaps must be) fought in a world that's hardly lacking when it comes to tales of injustice.
4 ||| This isn't just a story of right and wrong, it's a story of money and media and, most of all, spin.
3 ||| If you ever had doubts about the impact that celebrities can have on such a David-and-Goliath struggle, Berlinger methodically removes them.
3 ||| At first Crude looks like one more environmental agit-doc intended to outrage and inspire. Director Joe Berlinger is no doctrinaire hack, though.
3 ||| An elegantly structured, horrifying film that shows the vanishing rainforest may be the least of the Amazon's worries.
4 ||| As the film very eloquently implies, when the greater good is defined as profits, and a lack of culpability is proportionate to your number of shareholders, well . . . a lot of petroleum-soaked chickens will be coming home to roost.
3 ||| One has to wonder if oil industry executives are concerned about the release of Joe Berlinger's damning documentary.
4 ||| What Crude does best is take us behind the scenes and show in often candid detail how campaigns are waged, tactics decided on and strategies prioritized.
3 ||| 'Crude,' thankfully, brings insight and urgency to an issue that has until recently been ignored
3 ||| Crude unfolds like a pretty good legal thriller. Which, when you really think about it, is what this documentary feature is.
3 ||| A powerfully emotional documentary that grips like an expert legal thriller - by turns uplifting, suspenseful and utterly devastating, this is likely to be one of the best documentaries of the year.
3 ||| This intense documentary tells a hugely important story that's packed with compelling characters and situations. Although a repetitive structure and a sense of agonising futility conspire to undermine the vital lessons it has to teach us.
3 ||| A bleak, necessarily incomplete tale, and suffers from a late intrusion by celebrity eco-botherer Trudi Styler. But with this gripping, angry film, Berlinger has put himself back on the side of the angels.
3 ||| Although the real-life outcome may be known to some, Crude still, at its best, unfolds like a courtroom thriller.
3 ||| The Ecuadorians' fight continues, and their courage isn't to be doubted. Even the much-mocked, much-maligned campaigner Trudie Styler emerges with credit for supporting them.
3 ||| Gripping and powerful, Crude is documentary journalism as it needs to be. Blissful ignorance stirred with bland apathy is no longer an option.
3 ||| While the current trend in documentaries is to take stories and wrap them into neat little packages, Crude runs merrily against the grain.
3 ||| Joe Berlinger's film is a suitably forensic dissection of an ecological disaster and much less of a crusading piece of polemic than documentaries such as An Inconvenient Truth.
3 ||| A sturdy, hard-hitting account.
3 ||| Yes, Crude talks about the environmental impact of oil exploitation, but it is not just another documentary about this subject... it is the human perspective that prevails, showing the human cost of each drop of oil we consume. [Full review in Spanish]
3 ||| Though one-sided and all too happy to assail an easy target such as a monstrous oil company, Crude backs up its rhetoric by providing footage and images of the people and terrain affected...
3 ||| Another dark, gloomy drama about home life during wartime, this film features some seriously great performances and a theme that will resonate powerfully with thoughtful audiences.
3 ||| Although Hollywood has dealt with the war from various perspectives, Moverman's film offers a new angle that brings the horrors home about the decision to go to war.
3 ||| These largely self-contained vignettes are harrowing, the source of a font of raw emotional release that could never be otherwise captured except through a presumably invasive documentary process.
3 ||| Intelligent, graceful, and touching filmmaking.

4 ||| The Messenger, showing humanity under siege, opens wounds inflicted by the Iraq War -- not on the battlefield but in the hearts of the families of soldiers who never made it back home.
3 ||| What The Messenger has going for it is some sober, straightforward direction from Oren Moverman and a few strong performances.
4 ||| This film will be too much for some viewers because of the spot-on antiwar statement but the story is tight and the performances powerful.
4 ||| A devastating debut helmed with immense power and control ... Foster, a rising talent whose career brings to mind Edward Norton, is tremendous.
4 ||| Moverman understands the deep, powerful struggle that must accompany such constant grappling with death.
3 ||| Oren Moverman's sober and satisfying drama shows how the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have created a fissure in American society.
3 ||| Messengers with the worst possible message, they nonetheless manage to be human and alive .... In a film that itself bears sad tidings about the costs of war, that is an affirming, even an inspiring, gift.
3 ||| The Messenger is a successful examination of the harsh realities of war that too often are put in the back of people's minds.
3 ||| Together, under the assured direction of first-time feature filmmaker Oren Moverman, these three actors tell a story that is at once hard-hitting and bizarrely gentle.
3 ||| Just don't watch this and The Hurt Locker back to back or you'll need to refill your anti-depressants when you're done.
3 ||| A fine bookend to Katheryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker, showing another side of how the war at home can be just as rigorous as the one abroad.
1 ||| A shoddy, shouty bore. A piece of flummery.
3 ||| Poignant and insightful.
3 ||| The Messenger is a privileged glimpse into people's private pain, a drama shot with the simplicity and immediacy of a documentary.
3 ||| Director Oren Moverman's feature-length debut is a little like The Hurt Locker in the way it uncomfortably probes a little-known military organelle.
4 ||| The Messenger knows that even if it tells a tearjerking story, it doesn't have to be a tearjerker. In fact, when a sad story tries too hard, it can be fatal.
3 ||| Foster leaves you hoping that Will finds his way home.
3 ||| One of the rare movies that communicates honestly and artfully about the real casualties of war: the surviving combatants.
4 ||| Some jobs are dirtier than others, and after seeing director and co-writer Oren Moverman's beautifully acted new film The Messenger, you'll be better acquainted with some of the most grueling work a human being can be called upon to perform.
3 ||| This film doesn't take political sides -- and it's all the more heartbreaking because of its restraint.
4 ||| Individually, none of the mini-dramas in The Messenger would be enough to blow you away. But grouped together, they're so beautifully and specifically written that they make for a convincing picture of the first stages of grief.
4 ||| This is a wholly different look at the fallout of the Iraq War and its effect on soldiers and civilians. It is also a gentle portrait of grief, friendship and solace.
3 ||| A forcefully acted and peculiar emotional drama...
3 ||| The Messenger delivers what it has to say without sensationalism or political posturing. That restraint, along with the quality of the performances, makes it all the more powerful.
3 ||| Foster and Harrelson have a winning camaraderie as they develop a bond of trust and friendship. Both performances are memorable and deserve year-end awards consideration.
3 ||| Because of the nature of its subject matter, 'The Messenger' is emotionally charged, but director Oren Moverman and his able cast prevent it from feeling phony or manipulative.
4 ||| The Messenger involves difficult subject matter, but it's not hard to watch. It's sad and sobering, but also humorous and touching at turns.
3 ||| ...[The Messenger] highlights the gulf between those who have served in Iraq and nearly everyone else they deal with after returning home.
3 ||| Co-screenwriter/director Oren Moverman slowly peels back the layers to the characters, with the game cast helping considerably in that regard.
4 ||| The best war movies don't preach against war: They remind us of the costs for soldiers and families and ask us to consider whether those costs are worth paying.
4 ||| The miracle of this film is in its insistence on finding a way back home -- to fragile new beginnings giving way to new friendship, perhaps even new love.
3 ||| I used to think working at the Salt Lake City Hooters was the worst job in the world. Boy was I wrong. That dubious occupational honor goes to working for the Army's Casualty Notification Service.
4 ||| This is the type of original film that should be pulling in the box office numbers. Harrelson and Foster deliver completely natural and raw performances. See this movie now!
3 ||| This is a powerful war film that never needs to enter the battlefield for you to be fully absorbed.
4 ||| Yes, you're going to have to look for The Messenger. But the fact it's one of the best American films of 2009 makes that search worthwhile.
3 ||| It's hard to believe that an actor of Ben Foster's caliber is just now getting a leading role.
4 ||| Foster is a revelation, while Harrelson has arguably never been better.
4 ||| An emotionally affecting drama about the birth of compassion in an Iraq war hero assigned to work for the Casualty Notification Office.
3 ||| Powerful and resonant, this is a film that asks us to look at the human cost of war. Ben Foster is a revelation.
3 ||| Valiantly brings all wars to their ultimate endpoint: death and its effects on the fallen's loved ones.
3 ||| This is the kind of film people might skip due to the preponderance of war movies out there, or forget in the wake of flashier end-of-the-year output, but The Messenger is one to watch for great performances.
3 ||| Implies without stating, allowing us to understand and interpret the men as we will, without having anything forced down our throats.
3 ||| Well acted, bare-bones look at homefront horror, but it's not quite in the same war league as The Hurt Locker.
4 ||| The Messenger makes it [the death of a soldier] personal. And it is uncomfortable. Well-done movies about the tragedy of war and its impact on ordinary lives are that way.
3 ||| With the insight and sensitivity of an insider, The Messenger illuminates the sometimes invisible victims of war -- the survivors -- and a pain that is tolerated but never quite healed.
4 ||| As suspenseful -- in its less-violent way -- as 'The Hurt Locker,' as the soldiers bring their bad news to the homes of unsuspecting family members in a series of devastating vignettes, beautifully wrought by director Oren Moverman.
3 ||| The Messenger is the first film from Oren Moverman as a director, and it's a fine piece of work.
4 ||| Harrelson gives us layers of hurt under a callous yet needy crust. It may be the best performance of his career and certainly deserves Oscar consideration.
4 ||| A film that never forgets those who most feel the pain of loss during a time of war.
4 ||| ...a stunningly sad and sobering movie about the inevitable personal costs of national bellicosity.
4 ||| Harrelson received an Oscar nomination for supporting actor for his grim and volatile performance, but it could just as easily have gone to the quietly seething Foster.
4 ||| The bombshell is the news of a soldier's death and the delivery of that message is the heart of this unsentimental, yet deeply moving, story.
3 ||| It's Foster's movie.
4 ||| The film is premised on the verbal communication of urgent information, yet its many non-verbal moments provide the greatest strength and clarity.
3 ||| The vignettes of reactions to Montgomery and Stone's grim visits are the meat of the movie.
4 ||| A tremendously moving drama, filled with heartbreak, humor and, most importantly, humanity.
4 ||| A powerful, PTSD PSA for 'Don't ask, don't kiss and tell' advocates.
4 ||| The Messenger drives home the point that war is a losing proposition, which has nothing to do with who is victorious on the battlefield. They're the everyday losses of life, of family, of friends.
3 ||| The massage is important, and the acting from Harrelson is incredible.
4 ||| It's sublime to see Woody Harrelson become Robert Duvall, with grit, gusto and muscles visibly twitching beneath his head. "The Messenger" is draining, but not numbing - an agnostic anthem to the impossibility of applying predictive methods to grief.
3 ||| The film is poised, unforced and powerful.
3 ||| The two leads give nuanced, lived in performances that unfold slowly but with certain determination.
4 ||| The worst job in the army isn't cleaning latrines or disarming roadside bombs, it is being back home telling people that someone they love has been killed.
3 ||| Viewers will appreciate the work ethic up there on the screen, and how it finds a number of fresh and telling angles on the complexities of the grieving process.
4 ||| Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster dominate every inch of the screen.
3 ||| This is a great anti-war film examining the residual effect of war on the people who fight it and the people who are left behind.
3 ||| It's a tough job but someone's got to do it in a moving look at one of the armed forces' most harrowing details.
3 ||| A powerhouse performance full of tragic comic undertones while looking at the psychological effects of war in an original storytelling manner...
3 ||| The Oscar-nominated script pursues a grimly honourable task into its grim and not always honourable byways.
3 ||| Intimate, powerful filmmaking.
3 ||| [An] unpredictable, episodic, deeply resonant character piece.
3 ||| It's a film of quietly assured dramatic clout, a strong and sober reckoning with American conscience.
3 ||| Stumbles a little, loosening its grip in the bromantic final stretch. But if impenitent heartstring pluckage is what you're after, this is where it's at.
3 ||| This worthwhile drama reports from the home front as the war on terror continues.
3 ||| It's a shame so few people will see this on the silver screen.
3 ||| It never feels contrived or overwritten, managing to deftly pack emotional punches through the strength of its performances and direction.
3 ||| Alejado de cualquier rastro de patriotismo, desnudando la complejidad emocional detrás de un drama históricamente recurrente que ha sido retratado con frecuencia por el cine norteamericano, aunque esta vez de manera un poco más intimista.
3 ||| It is relentlessly bleak, even in its lighter moments. The downbeat tone is wearying. These days, we just need some hope.
4 ||| One of the most powerful and humane war dramas to spring from this current conflict.
3 ||| Thoughtfully dissects the overarching consequences of that unfortunate conflict.
3 ||| As a ghost story, the underplaying of the actors helps to make the mystery creepily effective, but the mockumentary format is a bit of a cop-out because it allows the filmmaker to avoid all the big dramatic scenes.
3 ||| Anderson's use of the documentary framework is an inspired choice, since it lends what we're seeing an air of reality that helps build the tension to jangling point.
4 ||| Every time this slow-burning thriller appears to be running out of wick, Anderson's screenplay drops in an unexpected twist with impeccable timing.
3 ||| The entire film may be a construct but the skilled direction, writing and acting give Lake Mungo a spooky 'realistic' authenticity.
3 ||| An after-the-fact faux-documentary about the death of a young girl -- and the creepy little hints she may have left behind.
3 ||| It's actually quite difficult to imagine that this isn't a true story, and that the actors playing the tragic Palmers are not exactly who they say they are.
4 ||| Apologies to Samson and Delilah, Mary and Max and Balibo: the one true great Australian film of 2009 was easily Joel Anderson's Lake Mungo, a mournful, dreamlike examination of the hole left in the heart of a family after a death.
4 ||| This masterpiece of modern horror takes relatively safe elements and turns them into nightmarish factors of a grim and realist mockumentary. [Full review in Spanish].
4 ||| The film boasts subtle performances and curious situations with unpredictable outcomes.
4 ||| It's the kind of film that Hollywood used to excel at but no longer seems interested in making.
1 ||| If great movies resulted purely from wizardly technical displays, then Czech writer-director Bohdan Sláma's The Country Teacher would be a masterpiece to give Béla Tarr pause.
1 ||| It's impossible to feel sympathy for any of The Apartment's characters.
4 ||| A barbed and occasionally brutal comedy with few illusions about personal or corporate ethics.
4 ||| Wilder and IAL Diamond's brilliantly witty screenplay has a serious undertow as it savages corporate ethics and conjugal infidelity.
4 ||| There is a melancholy gulf over the holidays between those who have someplace to go, and those who do not. The Apartment is so affecting partly because of that buried reason.
4 ||| Quite simply one of the finest comic romances ever made.
4 ||| Sure it's a bit dated, but that's not the movie's fault. One of Wilder's best films ... and that's saying a whole lot!
4 ||| This comedy tells truths about American business and sexual mors as uncomfortable now as they were in 1960.
4 ||| Among the funniest films ever to win a Best Picture, this was also risque for its time (and perhaps it is today to some).
4 ||| It's one of the most heartbreaking films I've ever seen.
4 ||| Humanism and cleverness age like fine wine, even if served with spaghetti strained with a tennis racket.
4 ||| Billy Wilder further enhances his filmic resume with this tender portrayal of a lonely man who may soon get what he deserves. Jack Lemmon is terrific.
4 ||| Billy Wilder somehow took a story about infidelity and suicide and made it into a comedy.
4 ||| A film for anyone who's ever been in love or had a boss; forget the credit crunch and take out a lease on this Apartment right now.
4 ||| With tremendous performances by the two leads (Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine), this is yet another "must see" title to be found on Wilder's resume.
4 ||| A perfect mix of comedy, drama, and romance, The Apartment showcases writer/director Billy Wilder at the peak of his creative talent.
4 ||| This Oscar-winning Best Picture still has the power and appeal that won audiences over back in 1960.
4 ||| This really is a film of ever increasing returns.
4 ||| No one does the pitchblack flipside of funny like Wilder, and 1960's The Apartment is the darkest he ever made.
4 ||| Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine shine as two essentially good souls trapped in a tangle of office politics.
4 ||| Beautifully written and directed by the great Billy Wilder, bittersweet and heartfelt, this is sheer delight.
4 ||| From such potentially edgy material Wilder and co-writer IAL Diamond sculpt an unforgettable romance.
4 ||| Production and direction wise, Wilder sustains his usual excellence. But his story is controversial and I am not one of those who can quite see The Apartment as the great comedy-drama he evidently intended it to be.
4 ||| A screen gem that attained classic status in about as much time as it takes to comb one's hair.
4 ||| A black-hearted satire this smart, cutting, and hilarious is good even if it can't quite find a way out of its nihilism.
4 ||| Balancing the comedy and drama is perhaps the film's finest achievement, maintaining a synchronization that keeps the story alternately funny and poignant.
4 ||| It remains a controversial, heavy-hitting classic from an auteur whose filmography is filled with them.
0 ||| The Golden Boys, writer-director Daniel Adams's adaptation of Joseph Lincoln's novel Cap'n Eri, could just as easily be called Grumpy Old Sea-Men or Two Brides for Three Salty Seadogs.
1 ||| peddles safe humor that's mashed up and spoon-fed to an audience craving toothless comedy
1 ||| Trying to sit through The Golden Boys is like trudging across the Cape Cod sand in galoshes during a nor'easter with a mule on your back.
1 ||| The Golden Boys is an object lesson in how to squander a seasoned cast, a charming premise and a breathtaking location.
1 ||| "Fame" is content to simply repeat the key moments from the first film without any of the grit or energy that was on display the first time around.
1 ||| Forget about living forever: This new Fame will be lucky to hang around for a month.
0 ||| Fame has today's usual gritty form of slick to it, but in every other way it's an Amateur Hour and a half.
1 ||| Somewhere, Irene Cara weeps.
1 ||| This film makes even the most gaudy of Saturday night TV talent contests look like Dostoyevsky in comparison.
1 ||| A desperate, cynical -- and most likely unsuccessful -- attempt by a dying studio to stave off oblivion by jumping on the High School Musical bandwagon, exploiting one of its legacy titles in ways that dishonor the original.
1 ||| The awful truth about no one from the Fame movie or TV show going on to become famous may not yet have dawned on the cast of this new and bizarrely pointless remake.
1 ||| In addition to the movie's general awfulness, there's an undercurrent of contempt toward the women characters.
1 ||| a totally unoriginal and unnecessary remake that runs far, far away from anything edgy, controversial or interesting.
1 ||| Everything is predictable, which is to the detriment of the mostly fine, young talent that appears in this ineffective retread.
1 ||| Fame! 2009 is destined to become famous for all the wrong reasons.
1 ||| absolutely shameless in its sadistic trotting-out of every single rabbit in the tiny teen-pageant top hat.
4 ||| So far, this is one of the best docs in terms of intelligence and craftsmanship this year.
4 ||| Outrage is essential viewing -- a film that offers a window into modern politics, and the political obstacles faced by gays and lesbians around the country.
4 ||| A brave, provocative and thoroughly compelling expos that you'll be talking about for weeks.
4 ||| A hugely entertaining, effective doc, and even if no one sees it, it should provide fuel for the fire for years to come.
4 ||| This is a portrait of how modern politics is still getting it wrong when it comes to gay rights, made worse by the fact that many of the puppet masters behind anti-gay legislation are homosexual themselves.
1 ||| Director Anthony Fabian and his team of writers have lost sight of the conflicts inherent in her story, relying on TV-movie cliché and tired, unsuccessful attempts at emotional manipulation.
4 ||| Based on a true story, his powerful drama tells an important story from Apartheid-era South Africa with honesty and real sensitivity. And the cast makes it thoroughly gripping by never playing it safe.
4 ||| A frightening primer on how untreated racism can lead someone to abandon, even hate their own offspring.
4 ||| This great film by Anthony Fabian tells this story through the eyes of a happy girl who grows into an outsider.
1 ||| It's a neat idea, of one life "standing-in" for another and starting afresh, but badly handled. It's a glum 79 minutes.
4 ||| It's a pretty terrific movie -- unruly, a little attenuated in its unexpectedly lyrical third act, but clearly the work of a major director.
4 ||| Leave it to Park Chan-Wook to put a stake in any pretty, romanticized notions of the undead in down and dirty, daring and dynamic style.
4 ||| Boldly erotic and playfully ponderous about sins of the flesh, "Thirst" rips open its bodice, and various veins, with arterial sprays of carnage and carnality. It's a savage, frank, fanged fusion of "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice."
4 ||| A formula thriller done as an elegant genre exercise.
1 ||| The directors never bother to delve into why these men need simple answers, and avoid complications at all costs.
1 ||| Instead of digging up and making sense of true information, it tracks half a dozen boring conspiracy theorists spouting balderdash and makes no effort to check out their cuckoo claims.
1 ||| An unrelentingly tedious documentary.
4 ||| A timely, provocative, vital and eye-opening documentary.
1 ||| Stupid
4 ||| What it may lack in an official body count, April Fool's Day more than makes up for with its whip-smart script, charismatic performances, and a whopper of an ending that I certainly wasn't expecting at all the first time I saw it.
1 ||| If you go in expecting an amusing stinker, you may enjoy it.
0 ||| Is there a word that transcends abysmal? BLOOD is the lowest form of cinematic garbage that carries not a single shred of redeemable screen time.
1 ||| Shows a new level of filmmaking incompetence previously only seen in the films of Dr. Uwe Boll. It is just plain awful
1 ||| Blood is borderline incomprehensible.
1 ||| Apparently someone forgot to add an extra dimension in the process of adapting the film from anime -- the characters have the personality of cardboard cutouts and the actors deliver performances to match.
1 ||| The action is repetitive and unoriginal, but it at least offers a respite from the horrible writing and acting.
1 ||| Often-unwatchably dim.
1 ||| Watch True Blood, Let the Right One In or Twilight instead. Or wait for Thirst or New Moon or Daybreakers or ...
0 ||| Not only isn't the new effort up to the standards of the anime, it's bloody awful by any standard.
1 ||| Suffers from abusive close-ups, repetitive fight sequences and uninspired demon design.
1 ||| If that sounds kind of hot, don't get your hopes up.
1 ||| So laughably awful that it easily qualifies for so-bad-it's-good status.
0 ||| Really, is there supposed to be any entertainment value in this thing, or is it meant to be a ponderously stupid endurance test?
4 ||| I think this is a world-class film! It contains great martial arts and great storytelling, and it turns the vampire genre on its ear.
1 ||| Full of fake moments and 'Deep Thoughts' sentiment. It's the kind of film in which people stare regretfully into mirrors a lot.
1 ||| Director Jonas Pate and screenwriter Thomas Moffett have turned this strongly cast, potentially smart tale of personal intersection among a mostly rarefied group of Los Angelenos into an irritating and unconvincing slog.
1 ||| This is a movie for people who thought Crash was wise and profound, most of whom probably live in L.A. and know everything they know about life from watching movies.
1 ||| A perfect example of a sophomore misstep and a powerful argument for action stars to gather more experience before stepping behind the camera.
1 ||| Bears virtually no connection to the original.
1 ||| Tony Jaa is a lot of fun to watch, but Ong Bak 2: The Beginning is not only a step back in time -- to 1431 -- but a step back in this martial artist's international film career.
1 ||| Lovely to look at by small degrees, but a mud-spattered mess of a movie overall.
4 ||| this is a major Australian film in what's proving to be a great year for Australian films.
4 ||| As Kev, the veteran actor Weaving gives the performance of lifetime.
4 ||| Tron: Legacy is an exciting and beautiful film that I can guarantee will be considered a classic, just like the first.
1 ||| Tron: Legacy looks like the bathroom of a trendy nightclub.
4 ||| Fittingly, Legacy is not overwhelmed by its own technical brilliance, the human heart that beats beneath its polished chrome veneer being felt even over Daft Punk's evocative score.
4 ||| I'm actually going to buy a ticket to see it again. I never do that.
4 ||| I was 11 when Tron came out, and I was in the theater with my eyes glued to the screen and jaw on the floor. This film brought me back to that fascination and wonder.
1 ||| Tron: Legacy is a letdown. Let's hope this misfire marks the "end of line" for this fractured faux franchise.
1 ||| Labeling this film a "disappointment" really only makes sense if you were expecting it to be good in the first place.
1 ||| "Tron: Legacy"? How about "Tron: Tedious," instead?
4 ||| Watching Tron: Legacy is like witnessing a thermonuclear explosion from inside the mushroom cloud-white hot, dazzlingly intense and indescribably overpowering-pop art unlike any you've ever seen before.
4 ||| Worth its while for the next generation special f/x alone, especially when witnessed in 3D.
0 ||| The Canyon is so singularly inept it gives you a whole new appreciation for the ept.
1 ||| The best thing about this would-be nature thriller is Will Patton's zesty performance as a cackling, crazed muleskinner, a wily old hand who exits far too soon. There's nothing much to replace him, so we're in for a long 102 minutes.
4 ||| It's been along time since relentless, biting satire found its way to the big screen and skewered its subjects with such impressive skill.
0 ||| This intertwined tale of people struggling on society's fringe plays like bad community theater.
1 ||| Set among the mean streets and meaner people of downtown Los Angeles, this laughably clichd dive into sexual masochism and hardscrabble survival replaces story with outline and characters with place holders.
1 ||| A Beautiful Life makes little attempt to be credible or original. And the acting is poor.
1 ||| A Beautiful Life is nicely shot and features some appealing actors, and that's about it for the good news. The bad news is that the characters and situations are platitudes and the story is so heavy-handed that the film is hard to sit through.
1 ||| An amateurish, contrived drama that's neither captivating, insightful nor engrossing.
1 ||| It's one of those films that keeps sinking lower than you ever thought possible.
1 ||| The general hamminess implies a low estimation of our intelligence.
1 ||| Chloe is an atrocious movie. It's about bratty, self-absorbed people. And it makes the 96 minutes seem like 96 hours. It's a guilty displeasure.
1 ||| Don't let the wayward Oscar nominees fool you; this sex thriller is trapped in a tepid zone between quality trash and pretentious psychodrama.
4 ||| A highly evocative psychological drama.
1 ||| The kind of epic disaster that will leave cineastes wondering how a once-great filmmaker could take leave of his senses, artistic and otherwise, as completely as Egoyan does here.
4 ||| Sure it's a bit much. But just try tearing your eyes away from the screen.
4 ||| Egoyan never makes a story with one level. He never reveals all of the motives, especially to his characters. He invites us to be voyeurs of surfaces that may not conceal what they seem.
4 ||| The film finds real sensual heat whenever Moore and Seyfried are together, and Egoyan and cinematographer Paul Sarossy turn up the thermostat by making Toronto locales seem exotic and vaguely sinister.
1 ||| If you've been waiting desperately for a lesbian Fatal Attraction that manages to be simultaneously slick and tawdry, your wish has finally been granted.
1 ||| How could two amazingly FUNNY guys spend so much effort on a movie so bereft of laughs? Candy and Levy deserve much better, and they moved on to it after this junkpile.
1 ||| 1.5
1 ||| It may not be armed, but it's dangerous alright.
4 ||| A darkly funny and fascinating examination of body image, sexuality, and self-esteem.
4 ||| Co-directors Lexy Levell and Michael Uys deserve a 21-gun salute for fashioning a sobering antidote to all that patriotic claptrap about serving God, country and apple pie.
4 ||| The most magnificent travelogue disguised as adventure spectacle ever made. Or is it the other way around?
1 ||| This is the worst film to win the Best Picture Oscar.
1 ||| Michael Anderson's direction couldn't be more unimaginative and flat. A movie like this should be swimming in creative whimsy, and a sense of wonder. There's nothing of that sort here.
1 ||| It's a strange thing, this type of whimsy. Kari offers us ideas in place of characters, and yet he expects us to see through these ideas to the real-life conditions they represent -- and then to respond to them in kind.
1 ||| You know those movies where two very different people meet, and you're so intrigued by both of them that you hope they'll form an unlikely friendship? Well, The Good Heart isn't one of them.
1 ||| Ben is such a stock type, and his circumstances are so doggedly implausible, that his ultimate transformation and happily-ever-after are a preordained conclusion that one must dutifully await while enduring squishy dramedy.
1 ||| Collapse is boring. But what do you expect from a one-sided movie about a kook, who, at the time the film was shot, faced eviction from his home because he hadn't paid the rent?
4 ||| There is controversy over Ruppert, and he has many critics. But one simple fact at the center of his argument is obviously true, and it terrifies me.
4 ||| Ruppert's deep sighs, dramatic pauses and a slight sneer on his lips say that he doesn't care what you think because he knows he's right, but he forgives your ignorance.
1 ||| It's not one of Sparks's more inventive efforts and Cyrus's extended sulk doesn't exactly enhance her acting prospects. Not that this means much.
1 ||| Miley Cyrus must be stopped. Her emotional range includes happy and mad and nothing in between.
1 ||| While the movie will probably rake in big bucks from her built-in fan base (and their moms), the decision to showcase her dramatic chops may not have been in Cyrus' best long-term interest.
1 ||| Yes, it's Hannah Montana as a cynical brooder, and no, the movie does not pull it off.
1 ||| Cyrus is ghastly in The Last Song, bad not just in one or two ways, but in all kinds of ways. It was a disservice to the audience, to the material and to Cyrus herself that she was put in this position.
0 ||| It's the worst of both worlds as Disney cash cow Miley Cyrus makes the most dubious "dramatic" debut of any singer since Britney Spears.
1 ||| In case you wondered: Little girls still scream for Miley Cyrus. You too may experience the need to scream, albeit for different reasons, should you take one (or more) of them to see The Last Song...
0 ||| You can tell Miley Cyrus is trying to show her character is filled with dramatic, painful agony because she scrunches up her face like a Cabbage Patch Doll (or Renee Zellweger).
0 ||| Hopefully with this, his second critical flop within two months, Sparks will think thrice before hurting us again. This last song? A requiem.
0 ||| So bad it makes The Notebook look like Casablanca.
1 ||| It seems we're stuck in the middle with Miley. She's not ready to be a dramatic lead, and her core audience will be bored with this typical Sparks story.
1 ||| It's understandable why Cyrus would want to show she's capable of more than bubbly effervescence. But by overreaching, she only draws attention to her limitations as an actress while curtailing her own natural appeal.
1 ||| Sinks in its own excessive melodrama.
1 ||| Interminable
1 ||| Watching her graduate into mature roles is like watching a 17-year-old girl graduate from high school: So young, so full of promise, so little idea how to act like a grown-up.
1 ||| Death can't come quickly enough.
1 ||| The "last song"? In all conscience, that should really have been Billy Ray's Achy Breaky Heart in a brooding minor key. You'll feel the ache and hear the break.
1 ||| Disney starlet Miley Cyrus becomes an early contender for worst actress of the decade in this painful attempt at a romantic tear-jerker.
1 ||| Miley Cyrus makes a pathetic attempt to demonstrate her non-existent dramatic skills in this latest Nicholas Sparks-penned story.
0 ||| An obvious bid for the teen queen to extend beyond her comfort zone only to then clearly show her limits and need for further development.
1 ||| This is piano-key-tinkling melodrama that pulls out just about every cliché in the book.
1 ||| full review at Movies for the Masses
1 ||| This film is kind of a brilliant move on the part of the Cyrus Corporation.
1 ||| Cyrus and Hemsworth... represent some kind of theoretical low for how terrible two romantic leads can be, together and separately.
1 ||| Saved from failure largely through the efforts of Kinnear.
4 ||| The photography is stunning, and Bruno Coulais' music adds just the right soundtrack to this intriguing visual diary.
4 ||| A delightful and thoroughly appealing documentary that charts the adventures of four babies from the U.S, Japan, Mongolia, and Namibia.
4 ||| There's no narrator telling us what we're looking at or what to think. The adults here speak different languages, but the film is such a tour de force of visual storytelling that subtitles are unnecessary.
4 ||| Really, it's a nature documentary, except that the topic is human nature and the subjects are the only humans on the planet whose behaviour is unaffected by the camera.
4 ||| Watch a baby for a while and chances are you'll be entertained. Multiply that times four and you have BabiesM/em>, a documentary as funny, charming and un-self-conscious as its subjects.
4 ||| Might restore your faith in our perplexing, peculiar and stubbornly lovable species.
1 ||| So vapid and shallow that even the most devoutly Catholic viewers will find themselves agreeing that it never comes close to become a viable film.
4 ||| Babies are fine "actors" because they can't do anything untrue, and what's great about the documentary look at the first 15 months in the lives of four babies is how sharp Babies' focus is on a child's-eye-view of the world.
4 ||| It's a movie without a plot; a documentary without narration. It's a wonder about small wonders. 'Babies' is about four cultures of the world and how they raise their babies %u2013 the differences, the similarities, and, ultimately, the happiness involved
1 ||| I think babies are like fantasy football teams. I have my own, which I love, to the point of obsession. But I'm not nearly as interested in some complete stranger talking about his own for an hour and a half. Much less four of them.
4 ||| A beautiful and entirely embraceable bit of cinema, and a welcome break from the pablum normally served up at theaters this time of year.
1 ||| ...an absolutely interminable piece of work that seems destined to send most viewers into protracted fits of daydreaming.
4 ||| The baby stars were given the go ahead to improvise every scene. The magic came in the editing suite (Raymond Bertrand, Craig McKay).
4 ||| A ROFL treasure hunt which unfolds like an inner-city variation of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. What more can you ask for from a ghetto-fabulous, escapist fantasy?
1 ||| Even on its own limited terms, the jokes are sub-Friday sequel, and a last-act grab for Boyz n the Hood pathos is seriously reaching.
1 ||| A classic case of a decent cast trying to make the most out of bad material, but it brings nothing new to the 'urban comedy' than any of the worst Friday knock-offs.
1 ||| the worst urban comedy in a long time
1 ||| Haven't I seen this movie before? I think it came out in 1995 and was co-written by Ice Cube.
0 ||| There's a one-in-a-billion story to Lottery Ticket: Those are the approximate odds against a script this bad making it out of the introductory seminar at film school.
0 ||| A film so devoid of direction, so offensive in its storytelling and so wholly ignorant to its own philosophy, you would swear it was made by Madea Perry.
1 ||| If given the opportunity to see Lottery Ticket again (once was enough!), I'd break down... and buy some lottery tickets instead.
0 ||| A tasteless and obnoxious "comedy," "Lottery Ticket" is easily one of the year's worst films.
4 ||| A reminder of what the genre can accomplish when it stays true to a premise that actually has relevance to and basis in reality.
4 ||| Captures the harshness and the sweetness of our time.
1 ||| a standard-issue, relationship-thin rom-com that hopes its potty mouth will distance itself from the competition
4 ||| Going the Distance superficially resembles a genre film, but is hipper, edgier and about 40 I.Q. points higher than the average romantic comedy
1 ||| a crass excuse for a film
4 ||| I've seen so many romantic comedies over the years it's nice to find one that refuses to bow to conventions while still staying true to the genre in which it inhabits.
0 ||| Plays like the work of soulless hacks who put a conventional romantic-comedy script through some sort of Judd Apatow computer program before enacting it for the cameras.
1 ||| Particularly forgettable.
1 ||| A wan romantic comedy about the difficulties inherent in long-distance relationships and touches on every cliché in the handbook.
1 ||| It smothers the already frail story of their characters' long-distance relationship with enough R-rated gross-out humor for half a dozen Judd Apatow movies -- except that virtually none of it is funny.
1 ||| This empty, immature romantic comedy ultimately feels as if it's filled with all the hot air that separates New York and San Francisco, yet still manages to be a suffocating bore.
4 ||| This is the best of the romantic comedy genre since '(500) Days of Summer.'
1 ||| Whoever thought they could mix gross toilet-humor and endless vulgarity with romance has done a big injustice to these otherwise likeable lead stars.
1 ||| The only reason you root for a reunion at the end of this unromantic romp is because these two jerks really deserve each other.
4 ||| Distance: The Perfect Date Movie.
1 ||| full review at Movies for the Masses
4 ||| Burstein is a documentarian by training, and she milks an unforced honesty from the story.
4 ||| An original film that gets it right when it comes to exploiting both love and laughs.
4 ||| This easygoing, good-hearted, and spirited romantic comedy is a great end to Summer 2010.
0 ||| This is crap as we know it, a 113 minute package of romcom suck.
1 ||| I didn't laugh once at any of this trite, sentimental gunk...
1 ||| Formulaic, shallow and sinfully tedious from start to finish.
1 ||| Smooshing lips, no problem. Everything else, alas, falls in the category of badly written, badly acted, or a stultifying combination of both
1 ||| The Heigl/Duhamel hostilities are so persuasive their entire movie balls itself up into a shrill domestic nightmare.
1 ||| This exercise in cynical formulaic movie construction is best avoided, unless insomnia's been a problem.
1 ||| You cant open a diaper and expect a diamond.
1 ||| It's not that baby comedies aren't a legitimate popcorn genre. But by comparison, this sleepwalk through pre-fab family-life makes Look Who's Talking and Three Men and a Baby look like art.
1 ||| The plot goes through motions that will be tiresomely familiar to anyone who saw Baby Boom, Three Men And A Baby, Raising Waylon or dozens of other movies about unplanned parenthood.
1 ||| There is not a single deviation from formula.
1 ||| This is just a waste of time.
1 ||| Cue baby-based farce and all the romcom clichs you can eat.
1 ||| "Life", in this context, is pushing it. How about instead "desperate contrivance that unites two people who thought they hated each other"?
1 ||| Whose life are we talking about, exactly?
1 ||| I truly loathed just about every second of Life as We Know It.
1 ||| It's not as bad as it sounds. It's much worse.
1 ||| As "meet-cute" scenarios go, it's one of the more sick and twisted ones out there, not least because it takes all of 30 seconds for the film to forget about Holly and Messer's grief and embrace the hilarity of poop-filled nappy montages.
1 ||| It would take a much better director than Greg Berlanti to animate this corpse ...
4 ||| Even if the film isn't worth recommending, it's not nearly as bad as it deserves to be.
1 ||| The deranged fantasy of some demented social outcast.
1 ||| You've probably had bloodier encounters with a vegetable peeler.
4 ||| [Writer/director Adam] Green has crafted a potent combination of absolute terror and compelling human drama that will stick with you long after you've left the theatre or turned off the DVD.
4 ||| Frozen is quite simply terrifying. It will do for skiing what Jaws did for swimming.
1 ||| Where are the flying Saint Bernards when you really need them?
4 ||| February or not, Frozen already has a reserved spot as one of the year's best pictures.
1 ||| Frozen is good for five minutes of "What would you do if?" games. Then it's just stiff as a board.
4 ||| Taking a dramatic turn from the slasher hilarity of his breakthrough feature Hatchet, writer/director Green plays it straight with a script that has the virtue of simplicity.
4 ||| With believable characters, a real sense of terror and that terrific whatwould-you-do? plot, Frozen works on every level. A proper chiller.
4 ||| Armed with an appealingly pared-down premise, Frozen effectively establishes itself as one of the best horror films of its kind to come around since Open Water.
4 ||| Reinterpretation of The Snow Queen, Hans Christian Andersen's classic fairytale as an animated, female empowerment musical.
4 ||| As director and leading subject, Kimberly Reed shares all sides of herself. She's sensible, sensitive and candid, and brilliantly establishes a tone of contemplative empathy and compassion.
4 ||| Sometimes we forget that when documentary filmmakers begin a project, they don't always know what they'll be filming because, to state the obvious, real life doesn't work from a script.
4 ||| [An] engrossing, unpredictable, often heartbreaking family-drama documentary.
4 ||| Stirring and thought provoking, intimate and a work of quiet genius.
4 ||| Shows Polanski in brilliant command of a political thriller that ties you up in knots of tension while zinging politics and showbiz like two sides of the same toxic coin.
4 ||| Mr. Polanski's work with his performers is consistently subtle even when the performances seem anything but, which is true of this very fine film from welcome start to finish.
4 ||| It's a brilliantly made, paranoid, leftish political thriller. And it's also the first great film of the year.
4 ||| ...a smart and satisfying mystery that relies just as much on substance as it does style.
4 ||| Polanski at 76 provides a reminder of directors of the past who were raised on craft, not gimmicks, and depended on a deliberate rhythm of editing rather than mindless quick cutting.
4 ||| Not only is "The Ghost Writer" an uncommonly smart and efficient political thriller, it is also a Roman Polanski film through and through and, with the exception of "The Pianist," easily the best and most consistent thing he has done since "Bitter Moon"
4 ||| Polanski infuses the action with the quality of a waking nightmare. He has the capacity to take a simple shot of a ship coming into harbor and give it a feeling of foreboding.
4 ||| One of the first truly Oscar-worthy films of 2010.
4 ||| I am consistently amazed at Roman Polanski's seemingly effortless mastery of cinematic craft. There is no wasted energy and no indulgence.
4 ||| It might not be the right time for a Polanski film to play in a theater near you, but those unwilling to forgive the sinner will be missing the first great film of 2010, a Manchurian Candidate for the post-9/11 world.
4 ||| It's refreshing to see that Polanski can still make thrillers that never take a viewer's intelligence for granted.
4 ||| Smart and atmospheric, with a delicious undercurrent of brutality, this is a political thriller executed with the panache of Hitchcock in his prime.
4 ||| Polanski is in total command of his medium, something that hasn't been a sure thing since the 1970s, The Pianist notwithstanding.
4 ||| Sleek and sophisticated, evoking memories of Hitchcock. It's an elegant remainder of what a great director Roman Polanski was - and is.
4 ||| Polanski is a master of mood and pacing. The Ghost Writer moves forward at an assured pace and sprinkles in an acerbic sense of humor.
4 ||| Polanski is expert at keeping the audience guessing and turning the screws for maximum tension.
4 ||| May be, at its core, just a standard issue thriller. But as directed by old master Roman Polanski, it turns into cinema of the highest order.
4 ||| A methodical, intelligent, adult mystery...
4 ||| Harris and Polanski dole out the revelations carefully, and the dialogue crackles with both sophisticated wit and bare-knuckle energy.
4 ||| Suspicion and insinuation seep from nearly every frame.
4 ||| Polanski's film is nothing short of a masterpiece by a filmmaker who has returned to the top of his game.
4 ||| taut and suspenseful in interweaving the fundamental pleasures of a good mystery with an astute critique of the current sociopolitical climate
4 ||| What a well-told mystery. Hitchcock must have been watching from above and smiling when 'The Ghost Writer' was filmed.
4 ||| Polanski's most enjoyable film for a very long time.
4 ||| The Ghost isn't Polanski's best work, but it's a more worthwhile project than the 2005 Oliver Twist remake, his only other movie since winning a best director Oscar for The Pianist in 2003.
4 ||| The best thing I've seen so far this year.
4 ||| Hitchcock would approve.
4 ||| The brilliance of the ensemble acting here is perhaps Polanski's finest achievement
1 ||| [Contains] a series of fundamentally dispiriting moments that are seemingly insulated from criticism by the Polanski brand.
4 ||| But for fans of the auteur able to separate his personal life from his cinematic one, and for others open to old-school suspense where no one gets away clean and failure truly is an option, this political whirligig delivers the goods.
4 ||| A slow-burning and elegant thriller firmly in the Hitchcock mode but with shards of cynicism that are uniquely Polanski's.
4 ||| With The Ghost Writer, Roman Polanksi not only does his most assured thriller filmmaking since the mid-1990s, he also does some of his wittiest work in years.
4 ||| The director's shrewd and witty approach to the material demonstrates his finely tuned sense of the absurd. [Blu-ray]
4 ||| A good, old-fashioned suspense yarn that culminates with one of the most haunting final shots in years.
0 ||| ...a repellent, nauseating, disgusting motion picture.
0 ||| a bewilderingly awful concoction that seems to have been written by a committee whose individual members were forbidden to contact one another and who seem to be ignorant of the most rudimentary fundamentals of storytelling, screenwriting or coherence
0 ||| Grisly, humorless and over-long, this sci-fi thriller about the repossession of artificial organs isn't nearly as interesting, clever or original as it wants to be.
1 ||| Alternately smirking and dully disgusting.
1 ||| Should be immediately screened in film schools across the world as a shining example of everything that is wrong with the American studio system and the increasingly dreadful junk it produces.
1 ||| Repo Men starts with a sly premise - and then adds literally nothing of worth thereafter.
1 ||| This violent sci-fi retread is exactly what it sounds like: a film shoddily assembled from the vital parts of other, far superior films.
1 ||| Any picture that instantly recalls one of the worst movies of 2008 is off to a bad start.
1 ||| Repo Men is a rare film where Toronto plays itself. It's also the first I've ever seen where a typewriter is used as a lethal weapon.
1 ||| It's a film to be endured more than experienced.
1 ||| It's a baldfaced ripoff of Terry Gilliam's Brazil right down to the nasty twist ending.
1 ||| The slicing and dicing is unsparingly full-on, but it's the gruellingly slow pace which really does this in.
1 ||| A paranoid fantasy of what's over the horizon if the macabre rumors about the Obamacare death panels are true.
1 ||| One of the worst endings to a movie since Bobby Ewing stepped out of the shower on "Dallas."
1 ||| [An] immensely feeble attempt at a science-fiction action epic.
1 ||| Law and Whitaker are disastrous in the lead roles. It's a dreary and violent film that betrays its three years spent on the shelf.
1 ||| The script has a resonance of sorts with today's debt-ridden society. But it's also derivative, violent and lacking in both suspense and the sort of characters we cared for in Stephen Frears' organ drama Dirty Pretty Things.
1 ||| The script, ambitious and inept in similar quantities, tries to work the set-up into an allegory for cosmetic surgery, immigration and the credit-based economy, adding a dash of confusion to the general atmosphere of callousness.
1 ||| There's the seed of a good idea here. But good geh-RIEF, has it been turned into an all-clucking, all-squawking turkey twizzler of Foghorn Leghorn dimensions.
1 ||| As an example of how not to make a movie, Repo Men deserves to be studied by film students.
1 ||| The plot becomes predictable before an ending that appears to have been borrowed from Terry Gilliam's Brazil. Never as cool or clever as it would like to think.
1 ||| One of the worst endings of any film, ever. Seriously. Ever.
1 ||| The overused homages and a tacked-on twist ending are just failed attempts to save Repo Men from its own shallow blood lust.
1 ||| Enthusiastic stealing from other movies is great if I can feel the enthusiasm. I couldn't.
4 ||| ...one of the most gripping thrillers to come around in quite some time.
4 ||| This first feature from Daniel Grou, which recently premiered at Sundance, has much to offer.
1 ||| Torture porn that feels generic and not worthy of our time. [Full review in Spanish].
4 ||| At its best, this beautiful, off-the-cuff comedy-drama recalls John Cassavetes' shaggiest, most honest work.
4 ||| The movie picks away at the standard, glamorized depictions of life in New York to arrive at a different, essential truth.
4 ||| Deserves to be the major commercial breakthrough for both director Debra Granik and Jennifer Lawrence, its luminous, moon-faced star.
4 ||| The temptation to call Debra Granik's latest film, Frozen River Jr., will be great. But the longer the buzz builds for it and for Jennifer Lawrence's star-making performance, it will become abundantly clear that this is the Senior of the two films.
4 ||| ...a relentlessly bleak tale that in some ways echoes Charles Portis' classic True Grit, another story about a young girl who takes on adult challenges.
4 ||| Winter's Bone sometimes feels like a haunted house, where only extreme deference to scary people will save you.
4 ||| Sobering but unfailingly engrossing, uncompromising yet not without a certain hope by the end, Winter's Bone is the kind of original, blessedly independent work that major studios simply refuse to make.
4 ||| This terrific cultural and psychological thriller is a horrifying descent into mystery so mesmerizing I couldn't have taken my eyes off of the screen had I even dared try, the film made all the more potent thanks to Lawrence's superlative performance.
4 ||| A coming-of-age story that is not entirely about breaking free.
4 ||| Granik makes something real out of all of it. And even, against all odds, hopeful. Because, yes, this is a hard and stony land. But the life that manages to take root there tends to survive.
4 ||| Impressively directed, superbly written and featuring an Oscar-worthy performance from Jennifer Lawrence, this is a thoroughly riveting, naturalistic thriller that exerts a fierce emotional grip.
4 ||| Chilling as the woods in the dark, this quiet mystery has kindness and humanity sprinkled across hopelessness so constant you forget to breathe.
4 ||| A riveting exploration of old-society notions of responsibility and obligation, loyalty and betrayal
4 ||| Serious, sensitive and stirring, it reveals a gritty, cruelly uncompromising world within the confines of our own country.
4 ||| The gritty, desperate Ozarks milieu of Winter's Bone feels so real, so right, that you only slowly realize you're watching a detective movie.
4 ||| It's been a long time since a film has conveyed a culture, and a sense of place, with such telling precision. At the same time, Winter's Bone thrums with suspense.
4 ||| No movie is perfect, but this Sundance winner comes close.
4 ||| Winter's Bone is the best film of the year.
4 ||| There is a hazard of caricature here. Granik avoids it. Her film doesn't live above these people, but among them.
4 ||| Winter's Bone...constantly surprises you, not only with unexpected twists in the story, but also with the complexity of the moral and ethical decisions made by the characters. .
4 ||| Granik also manages to make viewers care about characters who wouldn't think twice about betraying their own families for a few bucks or maybe another hit.
4 ||| It's a tough, no-nonsense film, with a tough, no-nonsense protagonist, and the kind of slow-burning, ominous atmosphere that gets under your skin and lingers for days.
4 ||| With Winter's Bone, Granik has morphed from a director worth watching to one who demands our undivided attention. She's got mine.
4 ||| Jennifer Lawrence gives a stirring turn in a gift-of-a-lifetime role.
4 ||| A masterpiece of sparseness.
4 ||| Winter's Bone is the kind of film that should be offered to us more often.
4 ||| The setting, which I don't recall ever seeing on film, is menacing, unsettling and so foreign-seeming I kept forgetting Winter's Bone is set in present-day Missouri.
4 ||| The picture offers a rare look at a region that will seem as foreign to most moviegoers as the forest moon of Endor.
4 ||| By its towering ending, the movie feels like a feminist reworking of a classical heroic myth.
4 ||| An altogether astonishing film, not in the least because Winter's Bone lives up to the hype -- or so nearly that it makes no difference.
4 ||| leavens its worst moments with a sense of compassion and tenderness that reminds us to understand and empathize with, rather than judge, the characters
4 ||| A spare but riveting drama built around a raw, revelatory performance from Jennifer Lewis, it is one of the best movies to land in theaters to this point this year. By far.
4 ||| Winter's Bone is a genuine triumph, a great movie with astounding performances so natural, so genuine, that you forget it's a movie.
4 ||| This unblinking look at America's Red State Crystal Meth Belt is an instant Southern Gothic classic.
4 ||| The sound of rarely heard voices and a portrait of a world all but forgotten except by the people who live there.
4 ||| The film explores the crushing poverty of America's rural regions, a Grapes of Wrath-style story with a country noir twist [that] feels authentic and original immediately.
4 ||| There are so many unforgettable scenes, in which I found my heart racing at not knowing what was about to happen, that I found myself forgetting to breathe.
4 ||| Granik deftly creates a film that's both a suspenseful crime drama and a pitiless portrait of a part of America that's usually ignored.
4 ||| A vivid reworking of Daniel Woodrell's novel that brings the book's conflicted heroine to searing life in a piece of unhurried filmmaking too rarely seen these days.
4 ||| Director Debra Granik has captured a female performance of such rare, career-defining intensity that the film actually has a life-affirming effect.
4 ||| The film, adapted by director Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini from the novel by Daniel Woodrell, establishes a formidable tension between mystery and matter-of-factness.
4 ||| The film continues to grow in the memory months after it was first seen which is always a sign of something great.
4 ||| A Chilling look at American Poverty.
4 ||| Winter's Bone is indeed harrowing, but it is also fun. It's fun, because it's excellent, and after enduring the mostly-disappointing Hollywood blockbuster season, simply seeing an exquisite piece of work such as this brings a smile to my face.
4 ||| Uma narrativa densa e multifacetada que permite que aquelas pessoas desafiem nossos preconceitos e se apresentem como indivduos imperfeitos, sim, mas jamais unidimensionais.
4 ||| Jennifer Lawrence is dazzling as the film's protagonist as she struggles to uncover the truth between her addict father's disappearance.
4 ||| Call me a sucker for punishment but I find myself drawn to these harrowing tales, and Winter's Bone is certainly one of those.
4 ||| Winter's Bone is a haunting film of life in America, one that depicts meth as the replacement for moonshine. Ree's character does offer hope but much more is needed.
4 ||| It's a harsh life in a hostile world, observed in such fine detail that the setting transforms into a living, breathing entity suffering through the same struggles as its characters.
4 ||| A stunning and authentic portrait.
4 ||| A poignant human story deeply rooted in feelings we all can relate to even if we come from a more conventional family than this one.
4 ||| A remarkable family drama with five endearing characters whose struggles and foibles are both genuine and touching.
4 ||| Kids makes its own special magic. It's irresistible.
4 ||| It's a brilliant screenplay, but happily, this is also Cholodenko's most visually satisfying movie.
4 ||| It treats both its characters and its audience with respect, everything building with a delightful effortlessness that's both enchanting and deeply moving.
4 ||| It's a movie about basic things, about the meaning of family and the vulnerability of families, with the suggestion that the ones most subject to bombardment are the families least protected by custom and tradition.
4 ||| Kids may sound like typically quirky arthouse fare. But this is a movie for everyone -- and, in one way or another, about everyone, too.
4 ||| This gem features five topnotch, multidimensional performances in one of this summer's most engaging films.
4 ||| Expect a human comedy about relationships that haven't been fully explored on film before, told in a fashion that ensures tenderness trumps self-importance at every turn.
4 ||| The best thing about the film is its bigheartedness. It's not out to mock these people, but rather to show how any person of any orientation can become unraveled when high-minded principles meet with base human instincts.
4 ||| Such a low-key feat of filmmaking that the scope of its offhanded generosity -- toward its characters, its story, its actors and its audience -- may not hit you until days after you've seen it.
4 ||| Plenty of movies strive for topicality, but occasionally something like The Kids Are All Right slaps you in the face with the world you're actually living in.
4 ||| "All right" doesn't begin to describe it ... the easiest movie to love I've seen all year.
4 ||| It's a film about marriage itself, an institution with challenges that are universal.
4 ||| The performances are all close to perfect, which is to say that the imperfections of each character are precisely measured and honestly presented.
4 ||| The specifics of the story only underlie its general, and universal theme: Marriages and families can be hard work -- and kind of worth it.
4 ||| A captivating, honest, unpretentious and intelligent portrait of an American family that's genuinely poignant, warm and funny. It brims with well-nuanced, brave and resonating performances.
4 ||| It would be criminal if , come Oscar time, Annette Bening and Julianne Moore are not competing for a Best Actress award.
4 ||| Cholodenko's film stands as one of the best American films of the year precisely because it's willing to look at what love truly gives, and what it truly takes.
4 ||| Movies like The Kids Are All Right -- beautifully written, impeccably played, funny and randy and true -- don't come along very often.
4 ||| The acting in this film is so good, across the board, that it doesn't feel like acting; we're simply watching a family going through some drama (and comedy) over a summer before its eldest child leaves for college.
4 ||| Directing from the tart, laugh-out-loud script she cowrote, Lisa Cholodenko (Laurel Canyon) has crafted an honest, generous portrait of the challenges of American family life -- gay or straight.
4 ||| [A] charming, uplifting, and very funny subversion of the traditional patriarchal family.
4 ||| Cholodenko and cowriter Stuart Blumberg have crafted a loving work about family that will resonate as true for those who find their experience reflected on the big screen and will be revelatory to others.
4 ||| A comedy of modern manners with the texture of a great short story.
4 ||| The subtle intelligence of this film is reflective in the title itself. By employing the words 'all right,' we are alerted to the fact that this film, however unique, addresses a sense of normalcy.
4 ||| A perfect combination of fantastic writing, strong storytelling and an All-Star acting ensemble.
4 ||| You can tell Cholodenko loves people, and that's why, in The Kids Are All Right, she wanted to show how funny and weird and foolish we often are.
4 ||| Funny and warm, The Kids Are All Right feels lived in and acutely observed, and is as steeped in joy as in regret.
4 ||| Here are five gifted actors at the top of their games as five characters in search of what makes a family.
4 ||| It's a terrific film.
4 ||| The Kids Are All Right is written with such perception, directed with such sensitivity and acted with such brio that the result is not only a path paved with good intentions but also one lined with loving detail.
4 ||| No matter what its plot particulars, The Kids Are All Right ultimately takes place within the human heart.
4 ||| "A great drama that is sure to be remembered at Oscar time (note to the Academy  the last name is spelled B-E-N-I-N-G)..."
4 ||| A comedy that perfectly balances natural hilarity with genuine drama while exploring a whole slew of issues.
4 ||| 'The Kids Are All Right' is a warm film about flawed people.
4 ||| A warm, funny, entertaining, slyly subversive little movie built around five very solid performances.
4 ||| I really enjoyed being dropped into this family's world for two hours. The Kids Are All Right is one of my favorite movies so far in 2010.
4 ||| ...a wonderful thing, intelligent in the ways of human foible, and generous with sinners.
1 ||| While Certainly Not its Intent, this Film is So Vapid in its Plot and Empty in Character It Ends Up Being Anti-Gay in Message.
4 ||| It's no less than a classic portrait of an American family.
4 ||| Packed with humble family principles. Immensely enjoyable the whole way through and one that delivers values and that warm fuzzy feeling inside to hold on to afterward.
4 ||| Cholodenko... nicely grounds herself here in the mechanics of day-to-day relationship maintenance.
4 ||| Kids more than just all right.
4 ||| An ultra-contemporary, intelligent drama sprinkled with humor.
4 ||| The leads in this beautifully told drama are more than just all right - they're Oscar worthy.
4 ||| Rich and funny, a film that doesn't condescend or strike a single false note, and one whose structure and detail work together in lockstep.
4 ||| Five of this year's best screen characters appear in this comedy-drama about a relatively ordinary family facing some unusual challenges. And while the premise seems extremely offbeat, it's actually beside the point.
4 ||| Films about the stresses and strains of marriage don't come any better -- or more entertaining -- than this.
4 ||| Smart, funny, slyly satirical and wonderfully warm, this deft 'dramedy' is bitter-sweet film-making at its best.
4 ||| Only those without a funnybone will fail to be seduced by its sheer verve, wit and charm.
4 ||| Piercingly funny, subtle and moving.
4 ||| The Kids Are All Right would have been a highly regarded, stinging family drama in the tradition of American Beauty and Ordinary People even if the subject family was not so proudly unorthodox.
4 ||| A twist on the traditional family drama, where every character has depth and deserves redemption.
4 ||| It is a wonderful example of what happens when you blend a near perfect cast with stellar direction and a story worth telling.
1 ||| John Stalberg's film proves incapable of striking even a faint comedic spark.
1 ||| Not only is this drug-related film not as funny as the likes of "Pineapple Express," it isn't even as funny as "Midnight Express"
1 ||| Surely this could be a fine premise for an entertaining stoner flick. It isn't.
1 ||| Lacking real kick, "High School" winds up as irksome as a bag of ditch weed and as lame as the pun of the film's title.
1 ||| There's no heartfelt bond between the generic main characters, no emotional drive or urgency or pithy observations about life and high school. "High School" only emphasizes the "high."
1 ||| A stoner comedy that runs out of gas.
1 ||| W're left with poorly reasoned scenes and storylines that dangle like a pothead's unfinished sentences.
1 ||| If it ever opens at a theater near you, remember: Just say no.
1 ||| No contact high is acquired.
1 ||| Quickly grows old with no likable characters or anything else, much less genuine wit or humor, to engage.
1 ||| Unvarying in tone and style, it's a rough slog.
1 ||| Mark Young's bargain-basement thriller is as witless as the captor's motive; to paraphrase another well-dressed Madsen psycho, this little doggie barks, but it has no bite.
1 ||| The movie might suffice on late-night cable, but it is hardly worth big-screen prices.
0 ||| An unnecessary reboot of the 1987 cult movie. Quite literally every image, every idea in Predators, is a straight steal from another film.
1 ||| The only interesting person is Grace, who grasps the essential absurdity at work here and, eyebrow cocked knowingly, runs with it
4 ||| Antal is a professional who respects your dollars. In a season where the blockbusters are as flat as month-old soda, that's the most romantic gesture a commercial filmmaker can make.
1 ||| Adrien Brody is trying to use the gravelliest, froggiest voice possible to sound tougher than he looks. Then he takes off his shirt and proves he is no Arnold (he's no Taylor Lautner, either).
1 ||| If it's not going to be smart, it could at least have the decency to not also be boring.
1 ||| Starts out with a bang but ends up with a thud.
1 ||| I had never wanted so much to forget a movie about something I remember fondly. [Full review in Spanish].
4 ||| An insightful and moving documentary.
4 ||| Stonewall Uprising is first and foremost about people. Politics and history and sexuality are there, too, but they're subsidiary to the human stories the documentary tells.
4 ||| Stonewall Uprising is an important documentary -- and a passionate and compassionate reconstruction of the historic standoff between police and pubcrawlers.
4 ||| On the one hand, Stonewall Uprising shows how far we've come toward enlightenment and tolerance since that hot June night. On the other, it reminds us that there are still many minds to change and rights to win.
4 ||| Among the year's best non-fiction features.
4 ||| that rare breed of documentary, a film so exquisitely told you don't want it to end.
4 ||| A documentary that at its start purports to be the tale of two terrorists, the film keeps deepening and widening until it becomes a subtle, stubborn moral drama about users and the used.
4 ||| Compelling both as drama and as an indictment of the eight years of folly known as the War on Terror.
4 ||| The Oath makes spare use of images to convey a great deal. Al-Bahri's smiling child is surrounded by lethal weapons that are little more than toys to him. The color-drained skies of Guantnamo are juxtaposed with the lively Yemeni street scenes.
4 ||| Poitras has crafted an extremely savvy and compelling documentary, an essential piece of the increasingly intricate puzzle that is the war on terror.
4 ||| Even if Dudley Moore's performance weren't so darn funny, it would still be worth watching just for John Gielgud.
4 ||| One of the best comedies of the 1980s; Moore's signature role
4 ||| Simply comedy cold.
4 ||| Only someone with a heart of stone could fail to love a drunk like Arthur Bach.
4 ||| No. 1 on my list of favorite comedies. One of the funniest ever made.
4 ||| An extraordinary expose' illustrating what a crying shame it is that the public schools in the inner cities have degenerated to the point that you have to rely on the luck of the draw for a decent education.
4 ||| You look at all these beautiful kids, with all the potential in the world, and every expectation for a great life, and you know that at most one-sixth of them will come out of the room with a fighting chance. That shouldn't be.
4 ||| Entertaining, insightful, and moving.
4 ||| Rough, raw, and entirely unapologetic action classic.
4 ||| ...there's no mistaking the modern racial and sexual politics encoded in the distinctly western elements of Carpenter's lean, mean, genre-defying masterpiece.
4 ||| Assault on Precinct 13 is one of Carpenter's best, an ultra-gritty cop story.
4 ||| This early Carpenter movie still holds up as one of the director's best works.
4 ||| In Assault On Precinct 13, hell is an abandoned police station in Los Angeles and the only means of survival is cooperation across racial, class, and legal lines.
4 ||| Perhaps Carpenter's best film next to The Thing, this is a model of low-budget filmmaking, with a tight script, appropriately tight-lipped actors and atmospheric location shooting.
4 ||| A vital moment in the career of one of cinema's most important directors and a searingly tense thriller in its own right.
4 ||| A great little gothic horror anthology. Track this one down if you can!
4 ||| One of the best anthology horror films ever made
4 ||| Campy cult proves that Hell hath no fury like a 50 foot woman scorned.
1 ||| Typical exploitation stuff. The B-level camp charm of the original is absent here.
1 ||| Astoundingly dull, The Aviator should be revisited purely by enthusiasts of its two leads or those looking for a visual sleep aid.
1 ||| Dry-as-dust "possession" fare.
1 ||| Funnier than most comedies
1 ||| A disgrace to the memory of Laurel and Hardy and the Hal Roach original.
4 ||| [A] smart, character-driven Western that plays a little like the undercover cop genre.
4 ||| A highly engaging sleeper.
4 ||| Bad News Bears is one of those rare films that I loved as a child and I still love just as much as an adult.
4 ||| Matthau's perfectly restrained, brilliantly comic performance holds it together.
4 ||| This charming, funny film takes a gentle poke at Little League baseball and the American obsession with winning.
4 ||| If all kids' movies were like this, you wouldn't need to drag parents to the multiplexes.
4 ||| Stagy pacing and a few woeful missteps can't change the fact that this is a creepified horror classic.
4 ||| Excellent, chilling classic with McCormack as perfect demon child.
4 ||| Never before has a movie considered the game from the inside out.
4 ||| A well-done if depressing film.
4 ||| Mention this flick to any guy over 40 and watch him get all weepy.
4 ||| Even though it's forty-five years old is it as poignant and relevant today as it was back in the 1970s. It's worth watching for any young person, especially those involved in sports.
4 ||| Sterling, memorable WWII classic directed by Wellman.
4 ||| One of the most magical of all films.
4 ||| It is a credit to Cocteau's genius (and to that of his collaborators) that he has taken the unreal world of a fairy tale and made it as real as the world around us.
4 ||| Endures as an improbable dreamscape that marries the apex of cinema to a classic fable.
4 ||| A work of magic that makes the Broadway adaptation look like overproduced swill.
4 ||| There are deep undercurrents to the film, suggesting a dark, horrible and wonderful secret that might be glimpsed if only the viewer stares hard enough.
4 ||| One of the greatest fairy tales ever made. Pure film magic in any language.
4 ||| It's a magical passage to a more impassioned and bewitching era.
4 ||| Cocteau filters the story through the strangeness of dreams... you can't quite get a firm handle on anything.
4 ||| Cocteau's poetic aesthetic...the matter-of-fact extravagance...an otherworldly ambience...[combine to] strike an uncomplicated chord within us, directly connected to the wondrous nightmares of childhood.
4 ||| Amazing, enchanting, a masterpiece
4 ||| This version of the familiar fairy tale has long been revered for its dreamlike state, which continues to mesmerize even in this age of $100 million computer-generated effects.
4 ||| Beauty and the Beast is still one of the best French films ever made.
4 ||| A rich and vivid telling of the classic story under the elegant direction of Jean Cocteau.
4 ||| Littering his film with wonderfully evocative shots of steam rising off of the simmering Beast, Jean Cocteau accentuates his seething animal intensity.
4 ||| Cocteau didn't just interpret a fairy tale with this black-and-white wonder, but re-created a fairy-tale world.
4 ||| It's true that a bit of the film's impact has been diluted by its significant influence both within its genre and without; but the original is still a special thing, a beautiful hallucination.
4 ||| This film is such a visual delight that I gave up worrying about ideological considerations and just embraced its beautiful and influential dreamlike imagery.
4 ||| Brilliant fairytale fantasy, well ahead of its time.
4 ||| With interiors that owe much to the paintings of Doré and Vermeer, this visual feast is enhanced by the magical realism of Henri Alekan's photography, Christian Bérard's exquisite costumes and Georges Auric's audacious score.
4 ||| The timeless fairy tale about a young woman who agrees to dwell with a mysterious monster, as interpreted in 1946 by one of cinema's most brilliant visual stylists and mythmakers.
4 ||| By using the tangible magic of hands through walls, moving statues, steamy paws and the rest, Cocteau makes rapt believers of us all - adults and children alike.
4 ||| When bodies appear through walls or fly up into the air, it is almost as if Cocteau's camera has miraculously recorded a dream.
4 ||| La belle et la bête is full of wonder and mystery. It's cinema's ultimate love story, dressed up as a monster.
4 ||| It's precisely the questions and challenges of visibility-of what's obvious and to whom and why-that the film so masterfully explores.
4 ||| What's mesmerising about Cocteau's film is the seriousness with which it regards the fairytale material, combined with an eerie, dreamlike production design that's more effective precisely because it's more real.
4 ||| Cocteau's enduring fable remains just as enchanting and charming as it ever was.
4 ||| ...a special little film that's well worth seeking out.
4 ||| Hamer brings his visual wit to lives of Norwegian precision
4 ||| In many ways, Fritz Lang's The Big Heat, scripted by former crime reporter Sydney Boehm, laid the groundwork not only for "Dirty Harry," but for the whole sub-genre of 'rogue cop' films that began to surface during the Vietnam era.
4 ||| May be Lang's greatest American film.
4 ||| In-your-face tough cop-gangster noir yarn features gritty Glenn Ford and great Gloria Grahame.
4 ||| That's the beauty of Lang's moral ambidexterity. He tells the story of a heroic cop, while using it to mask another story, so much darker, beneath.
4 ||| Lang at his cruelest.
4 ||| A scalding face-full of harsh reality, courtesy Fritz Lang.
4 ||| For those who take their film black...Moral rot gets full play in Lang's 1953 police drama. [Blu-ray]
4 ||| Extremes of light/shade are tight-focused in ace turns from a malignant Lee Marvin and vivacious Gloria Grahame, while Lang's direction kicks hard: just like a shot of hot, black coffee.
4 ||| The film is drum-tight, directed with muscular clarity and force.
4 ||| Director Fritz Lang has no problems with a high body count, confronting death realistically, and showing violence against women - by both the protagonists and the antagonists.
4 ||| Great dialogue, atmosphere and performances by Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall and others.
4 ||| One of the greatest detective films to come out of Hollywood.
4 ||| A movie that every film student should study and every movie lover should watch at least once.
4 ||| ...fast, witty, and exciting. It may not make a lot of sense, but it's got layers of mood and ambience.
4 ||| This movie was among the most fun movies I have ever seen.
4 ||| A trama extremamente complexa  uma mera desculpa para os dilogos perfeitos e para a presena sempre intensa de Bogart.
4 ||| There's little else I can add about this proto-noir, one of the archetypes of the genre and a showstopper for Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart, who spar through a catty romance while dancing through a taut mystery.
4 ||| It matters not that even the writers (including William Faulkner) weren't sure who shot whom in Hawks' rousing adaptation of the Raymond Chandler detective novel.
4 ||| This is arguably the high-water mark of Hollywood's love affair with the infinitely slippery possibilities of the English language.
4 ||| True classic Bogie and Bacall, even though plot is way out puzzling in many ways.
4 ||| Tribes of monkeys doing monkey things, albeit things related to the perforation of the flesh: murder and blood and sweat and sex.
4 ||| The direction, cinematography, screenplay, brooding score and acting in this movie are all without fault. If you see one film noir movie in your life, make it this one.
4 ||| Bogart as Marlowe is compelling in this classic thriller that is complex but triumph of atmospheric cool.
4 ||| One of the great pleasures of the silver screen.
4 ||| Oozing class from start to finish, Howard Hawks' 1946 noir isn't just a Hollywood classic.
4 ||| The plot is a bundle of confusions, but who cares? Few films have made cigarettes seem so glamorous. Or had such seductive repartee.
4 ||| The Big Sleep is the best scripted, best directed, best acted, and least comprehensible film noir ever made.
4 ||| The Big Sleep remains one of the greatest film noirs ever made.
4 ||| "I don't like your manners." "I don't like them myself. They're pretty bad... I grieve over them on long winter evenings."
4 ||| Just when a few solutions are offered up, further conundrums arise, as if fate dictates that Marlowe can never really be finished with a case.
4 ||| Only Alfred Hitchcock could take a premise which is so patently ridiculous -- the birds come to life and try to kill everybody -- and construct a beautifully realized thriller.
4 ||| The Birds is most notable though for turning something completely harmless into an incredible menace -- all with absolutely no explanation.
4 ||| Underestimated at the time, this is Hitchcok's last undisputed masterpiece, and a more complex film than Psycho
4 ||| Technically, the best Hitchcock ever...and one of the most nail-biting.
4 ||| This masterpiece is one of Hitchcock's purest forays into cinema; it's such a complete piece that it even gets by with two mediocre actors.
4 ||| Hailed as one of Hitchcock's masterpieces by some and despised by others, The Birds is certainly among the director's more complex and fascinating works.
4 ||| Genuinely disturbing thriller classic from the master of suspense.
4 ||| The only thing dated is the special effects. The suspense holds up very well.
4 ||| This Hitchcock classic somehow strayed from favour for a while, yet in the realm of popular mythology it is now rivalled only by Vertigo or Psycho.
4 ||| In the thick of an impeccable narrative that pays deep attention to all those involved, the great filmmaker manages to reach far inside the psychological chasm and find a rich inspiration.
4 ||| The true genius of the film, based on a 1952 short story by Daphne du Maurier, is the way Hitchcock makes the malevolent birds seem like manifestations of his characters' mental unease.
4 ||| Riddled with alarming moments - primarily from wandering down dark hallways alone, but also from sitting in silence waiting for the next inevitable avian ambush.
1 ||| A whodunit that begs the question of why it was made.
4 ||| Although strictly standard fare, the material is elevated somewhat through Clark's skillful handling of such plot devices as obscene phone calls from the killer to the girls via the upstairs phone and a nicely handled twist ending.
4 ||| Generally heralded as the first of its kind, Black Christmas may actually be one of a kind.
1 ||| Something less fun than the worst exploitation sci-fl flick thrown at us by the likes of Roger Corman.
4 ||| Ranks among the very best films to come from the post-Star Wars sci-fi boom.
4 ||| Silent Fairbanks has acrobatic Doug and great effects.
1 ||| A big stupid pile of junk. Am I being too forward?
4 ||| A film that was 25 years ahead of its time, John Frankenheimer's Black Sunday is an intelligently written, complex and constantly intense thriller that builds to an extremely exciting climax.
0 ||| Horrific and dated....worth seeing from a strictly historical standpoint.
4 ||| The themes and visual flourishes that we associate with the mature director are already at play.
4 ||| Overall, it's an essential early Hitchcock, showing the master confidently finding his stride.
1 ||| A sex farce with flat characters trapped within '80s sensibilities...
0 ||| This is something special, even among its ilk. Frighteningly bad.
1 ||| Would you believe My Stepmother Is an Alien was better?
1 ||| Once you get past the now hokey gore, there's nothing left.
0 ||| Unfortunately, while it certainly broke new ground in terms of explicit gore, it isn't a very good film.
0 ||| One of the masterpieces of truly feckless cinema, an epic fail of such grandeur that Ed Wood himself would be hard-pressed to do better. Worse. You know what I mean.
1 ||| The blocky cinematography that never seems to capture what it's supposed to be looking at could almost be called avant-garde.
4 ||| An unqualified masterpiece and milestone.
4 ||| Intriguing for its glimpses of backstage life in shabby German postwar vaudeville, and for Dietrich's performance.
4 ||| It's a brilliant, vitriolic condemnation of pre-WWII German Conservatism.
4 ||| Besides discovering Dietrich, von Sternberg created one of the few early sound films to retain the bravura cinema of the late silent era.
4 ||| Essential Sternberg
4 ||| A classic of the German cinema. Jannings is tragic, Dietrich is devastating.
4 ||| Classic Con Sternberg drama which made Dietrich a superstar.
4 ||| Once the party's over, the money's lost and the humiliation has set in, what leader, what purifying force can rescue everyone from this devastating shame, while supplying something of the same erotic, exalting excitement?
4 ||| Unlike the monsters of Murnau and Wiene, Blue Angel's light is equal to its darkness
4 ||| ...part exploitation piece, part morality tale.
4 ||| If you want to see Jack Nicholson give a simple, compelling performance with absolutely no hambone antics, look no further than this underrated drama.
4 ||| Forget the re-make. This is the original!
4 ||| Speaking in a ditsy, shrill lilt that hints at concealed wisdom, Holliday slyly turns the dumb-blonde stereotype inside out.
4 ||| Perhaps as a whole, Born Yesterday isn't the equal of All About Eve or Sunset Boulevard, but I would put Holliday right up there with Davis and Swanson for her performance here.
4 ||| The moment Judy Holliday opens her mouth at and screeches "Whaaaaaaat????" in a thick New York accent it is hard to not fall in love with George Cukor's Born Yesterday.
4 ||| A great adventure, a lush romance, and a good movie.
4 ||| Hopkins brilliant perfomance adds complexity to Captain Bligh, and this intense and intelligent historical adventure is the third and best film version of the famous mutiny.
4 ||| Schaffner conduz a trama com segurança absoluta, permitindo que o espectador junte as peças do quebra-cabeças ao mesmo tempo em que seu diligente e improvável herói, vivido de forma espetacular por Olivier (mas Peck também merece aplausos).
4 ||| Fast-paced, gripping and totally ludicrous.
4 ||| This is a terrifically chilling entertainment, one that deserves a spot alongside the best paranoid thrillers of the 1970s.
1 ||| A film of unrealized potential.
1 ||| Lame recycled flick that wants to be "Arthur" and "Trading Places" but isn't.
4 ||| One of the all-time great sports dramas to grace the screen.
4 ||| A touching, exquisitely handled film dealing with two ordinary people who accidentally fall in love.
4 ||| Tender without being melodramatic, intense without being tawdry.
4 ||| Less cynical souls will weep buckets.
4 ||| David Lean's Brief Encounter towers over the majority of romantic films, precisely because it calls the bluff of the genre's wish fulfillment.
4 ||| An uncommonly good little picture -- and one which is frankly designed to appeal to that group of film-goers who are provoked by the 'usual movie tripe.'
4 ||| How extraordinary that such a simple, unassuming little film could work such powerful magic over so many people for so many generations.
4 ||| Perfect.
1 ||| Some films don't age well, and no doubt Brief Encounter had more of an emotional effect in the social climate of post-war Britain.
4 ||| A classic of passionate reserve.
4 ||| The loveliest period piece imaginable.
4 ||| Noble and utterly heartbreaking.
4 ||| Solid romantic classic directed by David Lean. Johnson and Howard are terrific.
4 ||| Lovely, small-scale romance by David Lean.
4 ||| Haunting in its evocative mood -- one enhanced by Robert Krasker's cinematography and Lean's meticulous, muted direction -- Brief Encounter primarily hinges on the extraordinary performance by Celia Johnson.
4 ||| Sheer perfection-the gold standard of tragic romances whose influence can still be seen to this day.
4 ||| One of the most vivid, impassioned and painfully believable love stories ever committed to celluloid.
4 ||| The leads are outstanding, but credit should also go to the forgotten Cyril Raymond, whose decent dullness as Johnson's husband makes those stolen Thursdays seem so special.
4 ||| One of cinema's classic love stories.
4 ||| Romance and goodness are evoked with equal power and from these conflicting impulses, voluptuous demons spring eternal.
4 ||| Brief Encounter makes an illicit love affair more than that, giving the doomed romance more of a soul than a thousand tragic romances since then.
4 ||| ...captures roiling emotions with elegant panache.
4 ||| Lean solidified his mastery of emotional intimacy even without the epic scope, and crafted what many consider to be one of his finest achievements.
4 ||| Films like this, naive as they seem today, helped nudge a xenophobic nation toward racial tolerance.
4 ||| Tremendously downbeat, but beautifully stylized.
4 ||| The love story at the center of Broken Blossoms is deliberately overstuffed but unmistakably colored with infinite shades of biting irony and social critique.
4 ||| There is so much that is unusually excellent and excellently unusual in Broken Blossoms that one is compelled by enthusiasm to write about it.
4 ||| The most elemental and uncluttered of D.W. Griffith's major melodramas.
1 ||| Dumb, dumb horror flick on C level starring killer bugs.
1 ||| A witless, hapless exercise in the wrong way to package Goldberg.
1 ||| One of Whoopi's laziest vehicles ... and she's done her share.
4 ||| Monroe has the courage to make Cherie a far less talented performer than Monroe was herself.
4 ||| Moody and realistic, maybe Monroe's best
4 ||| In George Roy Hill's vision, the raw vitality of Peckinpah is replaced by a gentle amiability.
4 ||| Although Butch Cassidy wasn't the first movie to pair up a couple of wisecracking best friends in an action/adventure setting, this film became the model of how well that approach could work when done right.
4 ||| It lost the Oscar for best picture that year to Midnight Cowboy, a film that I suspect most people will probably agree hasn't aged nearly as well.
4 ||| Paul Newman-Robert Redford Western is as great as you remember.
4 ||| What can I say? This is the father of all buddy pictures, against which most of them seem forced and derivative.
4 ||| A classic in every sense of the word. Expert moviemaking.
4 ||| An archetype not yet surpassed.
4 ||| One of the most popular, deservedly, westerns of them all.
4 ||| Made like Cassidy's memorable fight with a fellow gang member: It gave true, old-fashioned Westerns a swift kick to the groin.
1 ||| overrated western box office hit
4 ||| Possibly the most likable movie ever filmed.
4 ||| A charismatic, fun and ultimately poignant classic Western.
4 ||| Note-perfect performances, a screenplay steeped in both nostalgia and a timely sense of insight, and anti-heroes you can't help but love: it's no surprise that the always re-watchable Butch And Sundance was once labelled the most likeable film ever made.
4 ||| iconic, American experience, a classic adventure tale, and a singular slice of late-'60s moviemaking that has never really been repeated
4 ||| One of cinema's greatest ever advertisements for pure entertainment...
4 ||| Although much of its freshness has faded, this still-amusing film reinvented the Western for a new generation.
4 ||| Funny and poignant tale of two famous outlaws.
4 ||| Of all the innocent and innocuous musicals of the 1960's, this goofy one is my favorite.
4 ||| The tunes are gold, and as Jane approaches a local creek, resplendent in her gorgeous yellow gown, we get one of the most famous visual gags in the history of the musical.
4 ||| The opening sequence of this wonderful musical is pure pleasure, as Doris Day rides the Deadwood stage across the screen and into our hearts.
4 ||| The songs are catchy and fun (well sung by Doris Day). It's a great movie!
4 ||| Ponderous and super romantic date movie musical.
4 ||| Exactly what we were promised: ornate, visually beautiful, romantic and staged as the most lavish production in the history of the Hollywood musical. If that's what you like, you'll like it.
4 ||| The great Garbo at her radiant peak, and certainly among the top five most romantic movies ever made.
4 ||| Miss Garbo has interpreted Marguerite Gautier with the subtlety that has earned for her the title, 'first lady of the screen.'
4 ||| works best as a twisted nail-biter, punctuated brilliantly with an apocalyptic score by Bernard Herrmann
4 ||| Keep-you-up-all-night terrifying!
4 ||| The film gets all the beats right; the situations alternate between nerve-wracking and infuriating and horrifying, all while the pacing stays precise.
4 ||| Flynn at his best. Curtiz at the top of his form
4 ||| Back then, Warner Brothers sure knew how to make these adventures a great time at the movies and today, "Captain Blood" is immensely captivating.
4 ||| With a spirited and criminally good-looking Australian named Errol Flynn playing the genteel buccaneer to the hilt, the photoplay recaptures the air of high romantic adventure which is so essential to the tale.
4 ||| Crammed full of all the adventure that $1 million in 1935 dollars could buy... It's all so much candy, I guess, but candy made with the utmost precision and attention.
4 ||| Flynn's star-making swashbuckler is right on target.
4 ||| Well-directed, well-acted coming-of-age tale that may have the most hard-bitten viewer in tears by the end.
4 ||| One of the all time best. Adventure, love, and tears. Tracy and Bartholomew are terrific.
4 ||| If that's a Portuguese accent Tracy is sporting, then I'm Katharine Hepburn -- if anything, his performance appears to be based on Chico Marx. Nevertheless, this is top-notch entertainment.
4 ||| A nightmarish puzzle. It's aged very well.
4 ||| The movie is a triumph of mood over character.
4 ||| demonstrates that the quality of scary filmmaking is not directly proportional to the size of the budget
4 ||| It retains an atmosphere of melancholic, surreal dread.
4 ||| A chilling ghost story with artistic pretensions.
4 ||| One of those unique horror movies where the low budget, gritty footage and rough performances combine to create not only an unsettling atmosphere of dread but also a study of existential angst in the face of unimaginable horror.
4 ||| If characters in a horror movie are watching an old black and white movie on TV late at night, and it's not Night Of The Living Dead, it's almost certainly Carnival Of Souls.
4 ||| A bold film that plays like a perfect nightmare for everyone who's used to standard structures in genre cinema. Still scary after decades. [Full review in Spanish].
4 ||| It's a gripping and rousing perusal of our human souls -- an opportunity to become aware of our dark sides and meet them head on.
4 ||| King's pulp-gothic imagination was perfectly realized on-screen in De Palma's Hitchcock-influenced manipulative camerawork
4 ||| ...suspenseful, scary, and humorously cunning by turns, it boasts superb acting, excellent pacing, good production values, and...a thought-provoking premise.
4 ||| This horror classic might be the ultimate teen angst flick.
4 ||| Here -- as in perhaps no other film -- De Palma's non-stop stylistic flourishes completely complement and enhance the proceedings.
4 ||| De Palma's masterpiece of pure cinema is the unsung Great American Film of the 1970s.
4 ||| Pure squeamish horror!
4 ||| Brian De Palma's Carrie is an absolutely spellbinding horror movie... It's also (and this is what makes it so good) an observant human portrait.
4 ||| A nearly perfect film. The combination of pathos, shocks, and grand guignol excess is orchestrated with jaw-dropping precision by young Depalma, whose later films would pale by comparison.
4 ||| A total knockout. Piper Laurie gives a bravura performance as Carrie's religious fanatic mother, one of the creepiest movie characters ever.
4 ||| Carrie might be a film about high school, but it was perhaps Brian De Palma's first completely mature film.
4 ||| The bulk of "Carrie" is not a gore-fest, but a prescient tone poem about the mental torture of social outcasts in high school halls in the pre-Columbine era.
4 ||| The reason Carrie is still held in such high regard as a horror classic is very simple: it's all in the sheer directorial bravado. De Palma at the top of his game.
4 ||| The film has a strikingly unsettling mood that enhances its power and gives it an impact that the story would otherwise lack. Much of the credit, though, must go to Spacek, who so convincingly portrays Carrie's pain and her longing for acceptance.
4 ||| ... [O]ne of the best horror films of the 1970s.
4 ||| Carrie is one of the most heart-breaking and cringe-worthy high school dramas ever made, and that's before she even gets to her apocalyptic revenge.
4 ||| A voluptuously shot horror movie.
4 ||| Brian De Palma's modern gothic fairy tale, based on Stephen King's bestseller, offers a tense and lyrical web of emotions.
4 ||| One of cinema's ultimate operatic teenage melodramas. I have seen "Carrie" more times than I can count, and yet it never loses its uncommon heartbreak and blood-curdling dramatic power.
4 ||| Like Jaws, here's one of those rare instances when the movie is better than the book. What's more, this box office hit easily remains the best adaptation of a King property (sorry, Shawshank and Shining groupies).
4 ||| Carrie sees Sissy Spacek in breakout form as the titular teenager.
4 ||| This movie is like Hamlet in that, even if you haven't seen either one of them, you are probably familiar with much of the dialogue.
4 ||| More an icon than a work of art, Casablanca is still thoroughly entertaining romantic melodrama, flawlessly directed, subtly played, lovingly evoking our collective daydreams about lost chances and lost loves and love versus honor.
4 ||| Casablanca is a must-have DVD. It is a nearly flawless presentation of a film that has set the standard for "timeless."
4 ||| The casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration.
4 ||| When it all comes down to the end, I think I'd rather be curled up in front of Casablanca (1942) than just about anything else. It's like a warm blanket, a hot cup of tea, or a cuddly old dog.
4 ||| This is the ultimate movie. This is the purpose for which Hollywood invented itself. This is how good a film can be.
4 ||| Seeing the film over and over again, year after year, I find it never grows over-familiar. It plays like a favorite musical album; the more I know it, the more I like it.
4 ||| A film for anyone who has ever had a heartbreaking choice to make, for film lovers who enjoy unpredictable endings, and for anyone who has lost a love.
4 ||| The greatest pleasure anyone can derive from this movie comes through simply watching it.
4 ||| What more can a person say about a movie that defines the word 'classic'?
4 ||| A brilliant film that merits inclusion in every self-respecting film critic's top three.
4 ||| It's a film that pays off the viewer again and again and again.
4 ||| It's one of the three I'd take to a desert island with me to watch over and over again. The romance between all three of the main characters jumps out at the screen.
4 ||| To many, this is the best love story ever, if not the greatest film of all times.
4 ||| Every bit the classic.
4 ||| Timeless. Just flat out perfect and timeless.
4 ||| One of the handful of films that lives up to its hype. This movie defines "classic."
4 ||| One of the best movies ever. The romantic pain still holds up, and political intrigue still compels.
4 ||| The movie gods kissed the production with a confluence of brilliant writing, photography and acting, with all parties collaborating at their ultimate peak of potential.
4 ||| One of the best screenplays ever filmed.
4 ||| Since it screened at the theater in 1943, the story of lovers Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) in Casablanca has made cinematic history.
4 ||| It is a true timeless classic and will stay so as long as time goes by.
4 ||| One of those rare films where every shot and every quotable line of dialogue counts, there's not a dead patch in Casablanca.
4 ||| Irresistible, big-hearted film-making.
4 ||| As time goes by, the appeal of Casablanca shows no sign of diminishing.
4 ||| It is one of the most timeless of all movies in terms of topic, emotion, acting and motivation.
4 ||| The film has a peculiar magic to it, and because of its pace the richness of its sense of detail often goes unnoticed.
4 ||| This is it. The best movie ever made.
4 ||| Every kid should see this Bogart classic.
4 ||| Rick and Ilsa. Laszlo and the letters of transit. Captain Renault and his charming corruptibility. "As Time Goes By." "Here's looking at you, kid." You know the routine. So round up the usual accolades.
4 ||| Whether you return to Casablanca for a nostalgia fix, a guilty pleasure or for the waters, you can be certain there'll be something you didn't notice last time out.
4 ||| Nobody lights a torch like Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa or carries one like Humphrey Bogart's Rick.
4 ||| The reason Casablanca endures is that it's a timeless love story wrapped inside a gripping wartime thriller, written with such wit and meaning that it's still quoted (and misquoted) decades later.
4 ||| There are some of the very finest character actors that Warner Brothers could muster and a rich, detailed screenplay studded with an indecent number of sparklingly quotable lines. It is a movie to play again, and again.
4 ||| Curtiz's film is a classic for a reason -- it's crafted with the precision, detail and beauty of a Fabergé egg; the dialogue is hauntingly memorable and, in Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, it has one of the most magnetic screen pairings in history.
4 ||| Knowing the story doesn't impair one's wonder at the undiminished magic of Casablanca.
4 ||| Stride after stride, scene after scene, moment after moment, everything comes together and everything is right.
4 ||| Casablanca is like fine wine--the film only gets better with time.
4 ||| Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are pure magic in one of the most romantic films ever. [Full review in Spanish]
4 ||| How can one film do so much, and be so effortlessly suave while doing it?
4 ||| No role is wasted, no shot overdone or overlong, and nearly every moment absolutely unforgettable.
4 ||| It may, in fact, be the first post-modern comedy, but it feels more good-natured than snarky -- and there's an undercurrent of true British satire here.
0 ||| Profoundly unamusing bore.
1 ||| Even more awful considering the wasted talents.
1 ||| Proponents of this dreadfully indulgent cabaret, which thumbs its nose at coherence, have called its nigh-impenetrable plot the sincerest form of satire. That's like citing the indecipherable nature of Zapf Dingbats as a foremost send-up of language.
1 ||| A few innovative sets, a wealth of eye-popping colors, and oodles of bared midriffs can't redeem this juvenile experiment in adolescent fantasy.
4 ||| The sort of creepy movie that is perhaps best thought of as spooky fun -- and 85 years have not changed that.
4 ||| Plays with cinematic form and representation like few movies of any style have gotten away with under the aegis of a big Hollywood studio.
4 ||| A mousetrap with teeth that grip and a musky atmosphere of frustrated sex and milky desperation that serves as poisoned bait.
4 ||| The performances are the thing in this film version of the Tennessee Williams stage triumph, led by Ives, repeating his stage role like a force of nature.
4 ||| Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman, both gorgeous beyond measure, strike sparks as the sexually unfulfilled Maggie and her tortured husband Brick, while Burl Ives is sensational as the family patriarch Big Daddy.
4 ||| No mere creature feature, this 1940s classic offers more subtle chills.
4 ||| The result is a haunting and subtle film, filled with desires gone awry and everyday settings turned inexplicably nightmarish.
4 ||| As well as being scary, the film deals intelligently with sex and the psyche.
4 ||| Atmospheric, chilling Tourneur classic
4 ||| Handled more with shadow and suggestion than the outright statement found in the horror pictures that surrounded it.
4 ||| Cat People wasn't frightening like a slasher movie, using shocks and gore, but frightening in an eerie, mysterious way that was hard to define; the screen harbored unseen threats.
4 ||| Magnificent.
4 ||| In its complexity, it functions as a sharp, canny blueprint for the rest of Lewton's pictures.
4 ||| The scariest American horror movie of the 1940s.
4 ||| It's psychological horror at its finest: timelessly terrifying and absolutely purr-fect.
4 ||| A masterpiece of the genre: No less than Martin Scorsese has stated that the movie is "as important as Citizen Kane in the maturation of the American cinema."
4 ||| [Cat People's] masterstroke lies in a constant awareness of its audience, using their expectations of its B-movie horror title to draw out the film's tension.
4 ||| One of the most sexually and psychologically astute films of its time, tackling female sexuality in a way that was unheard of at the time.
4 ||| Cat People is rife with subversive subtexts, alarming suggestions, and potent performances. Cinema rarely manages something so creepy and bizarre as Tourneur and Lewton's strangely poignant and unforgettable film.
1 ||| Abyssmal, literal-minded remake of the 1942 classic
4 ||| Cat People is a good movie in an old tradition, a fantasy-horror film that takes itself just seriously enough to work, has just enough fun to be entertaining, [and] contains elements of intrinsic fascination in its magnificent black leopards.
4 ||| A twisted, sexy horror classic.
1 ||| Falls into the category of works that should not have been remade - or, at least, it should not have bothered to use the original screenplay as a starting place.
1 ||| The most offputting thing about such canny, tear-stained movies as The Champ is not their navet but their unholy sophistication. These movies don't mean to deal with the world as it really is, but as it should be.
4 ||| Brilliant, searing, heartbreaking.
4 ||| Robson's direction is all action, wasting no time in telling this compelling story, and Carl Foreman's script is sharply observant of the boxing milieu.
4 ||| One of the best fight films ever, also one of Kirk's best
4 ||| There are only a couple of action scenes and they're okay, but the real joy is definitely from watching Hepburn and Grant together.
4 ||| Charade reminds us that when all the elements come together, it's possible for Hollywood to make a flawless entertainment that thoroughly whisks us away. Too bad it doesn't happen more often.
4 ||| An excellent piece of classic Hollywood entertainment.
4 ||| Classy mystery that combines romance and comedy with a surprisingly suspenseful finish.
4 ||| Everything about it is a little bit cleverer and a little bit better than it has to be. Thanks must be paid to both Donen and screenwriter Peter Stone.
4 ||| Sparkles with all the vigor of freshly uncorked champagne.
4 ||| The star power of Cary and Audrey is electrifying in this great comic thriller
4 ||| Smooth Donen thriller showcasing Cary and Audrey.
4 ||| even though the age difference is kinda weird the romance works
4 ||| Charade is able to successfully transcend the romance, comedy, and suspense thriller genres because of the cast, screenplay, and score.
4 ||| This absolutely wonderful comedy thriller from Stanley Donen (co-director, with Gene Kelly, of On the Town and Singin' in the Rain) nearly out-Hitchcocks Hitchcock.
4 ||| Almost as sweet as the children's classic novel, "Charlotte's Web" is just, well, crawling with entertainment.
4 ||| A charming animated adaptation of E.B. White's beloved fantasy.
1 ||| An absolutely interminable piece of work...
0 ||| "plenty of corn, for sure, but no chills"
0 ||| incredibly boring from start to finish
1 ||| This is not a story that was ever destined to work on film.
4 ||| A great and eternally heart-warming film that can stand an appreciative viewing every year through every decade.
4 ||| All in all, though, this is all very fluffy and silly and perfectly wonderful.
4 ||| A sometimes hilarious farce and a holiday favorite.
4 ||| A Christmas Story's message is aimed at children and at the child in all of us for whom the Spirit of Christmas is alive and well.
4 ||| A comfortable, homey movie.
4 ||| Sweet, funny and loaded with warm nostalgia.
4 ||| A Christmas classic to be enjoyed over and over - just don't put your eye out.
4 ||| A classic.
4 ||| There's a reason they run this for 24 hours every December -- it really is that good, maybe the best Christmas movie ever.
4 ||| Few Christmas films are funnier.
4 ||| My family watches it every Christmas. My sons tell me I'm getting to be more like the old man with each passing year.
4 ||| Maybe the best Christmas movie ever made!
4 ||| It's so sweet but it has the cynical heart of pre-WWII America.
4 ||| ...sharp, insightful observations, a careful attention to period detail, and, most of all, a gentle good humor.
4 ||| [It has] emerged over the past two decades as second only to It's a Wonderful Life as the definitive Christmas flick.
4 ||| A great Hollywood classic!
4 ||| Funny, touching and unabashedly nostalgic. A true classic.
4 ||| If you're a fan of Christmas movies or films that use nostalgia as a driver, A Christmas Story cannot be missed. Then again, if you're in either category, you have probably already seen it.
4 ||| This great heartwarming comedy from the director of Porky's was a flop during its theatrical run, but, like It's a Wonderful Life, has become a staple on cable during the holiday season.
4 ||| Wonderful antidote to saccharine holiday tales.
4 ||| [A] richly remembered tale of Christmas past.
4 ||| It takes pause to recognize the collective good nature we owe to one another all year round, and pays that knowledge forward with charm and wistfulness.
1 ||| The all-time worst winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture.
4 ||| ...a tale of two men being manipulated, and possibly loved, by a powerful and conflicted woman.
4 ||| A fine and funny film.
4 ||| The movie is worth seeing for a lot of reasons, one of them being the weirdly elegant pratfall Keaton takes on the baseball diamond when he gets clipped by an opposing player sliding into third.
4 ||| Keaton helped write the textbook on comedy, and in College he gives us a master class.
4 ||| Though its story has the makings of standard stuff, and is sometimes sketchily told, nothing about 'Colors is ordinary.
4 ||| A superb suspense-thriller.
4 ||| Commando remains one of the best and most exciting action movies ever to come out of Hollywood...
1 ||| Like "The Getaway," only it sucks.
1 ||| A bad joke that backfires on the director.
1 ||| Unmotivated story riddled with confusion and disarray. Production staff does the job with little imagination.
1 ||| A road movie of the yee-haw variety, it makes the more enjoyable Smokey and the Bandit look positively Shakespearean in comparison and even allows the dim-witted The Cannonball Run to appear as mature and masterful as The Grapes of Wrath.
4 ||| Charming musical built on a skimpy plot but boasting a score by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin that includes some of their best work.
4 ||| As directed by Jack Arnold, the film suffers from silly stretches of dialogue and wooden acting, but the underwater footage is still beautiful, and Adams radiates a strong, sexy screen presence.
4 ||| Very neat
4 ||| When I was a kid, this was the movie monster I wanted to be.
4 ||| The whole thing is ultimately just a '50s B-movie, but it's hard to imagine what they could have done to make it a better one.
4 ||| Crossroads borrows so freely and is a reminder of so many other movies that it's a little startling, at the end, to realize how effective the movie is and how original it manages to feel despite all the plunderings.
1 ||| A D-grade slasher flick that has delusions of comedy and mystery, of interest only to those who lust after Brad Pitt and would love to check out a performance the actor would probably rather forget.
4 ||| Terrific, Oscar-nominated score by Jerry Ross and Richard Adler is electric.
4 ||| Probably the best adaptation of the celebrated novel you can find.
4 ||| It's like Masterpiece Theater ... but not boring!
4 ||| Stephen Frears' direction is superb -- the design and lighting evoke simultaneous worlds of privilege and squalor, and while the nature of day-to-day life in 18th century France becomes readily apparent, it never becomes distracting.
4 ||| Its vernacular style allows the film to connect easily with present-day morals, sexual politics, and thirst for power.
4 ||| Splendid... full of deliciously devious characters
4 ||| Christie's Oscar-winning portrayal hasn't aged a bit, even if the movie's swinging '60s milieu has.
4 ||| Julie Christie is must-see in Oscar winning performance.
1 ||| ...a time-capsule curiosity that thoroughly squanders a fine performance from its talented star.
4 ||| at once the most hopeful and the most melancholy of the trio...
4 ||| An indisputable classic.
4 ||| Demonstrates you don't need to be bombed back into the stone age when you can reach that state by exercising your own stupidity. The subterranean setting is the tip-off: While the zombies evolve the humans devolve -- almost literally -- into cave men.
4 ||| This excellent slice of horror from Romero deals with the head-butting elements of science and military in a world ravaged by the zombie virus.
4 ||| Next time your parents tell you that they don't make them like they used to, believe them.
4 ||| One of the top, let's say, two science fiction films ever made.
4 ||| Long considered a touchstone in science fiction cinema, this stood apart from most of the other 50s sci-fi outings for many reasons.
4 ||| This is no ordinary sci-fi flick.
4 ||| The most amazing thing about this excellent film is how well it has held up and how its message is just as true today as it was in the immediate post-Second World War years.
4 ||| Absolutely among the top 5 sci-fi films ever. Keep going, Gort!
4 ||| still fantastic
4 ||| This is a superbly crafted, landmark film which invested a much-derided -- and frequently ludicrous -- genre with a welcome degree of dignity and respectability.
4 ||| Superb performances by all involved, restrained direction by Wise, and a magnificent and innovative score by Bernard Herrmann help keep this 35-year-old film just as relevant today as it was the day it was released.
4 ||| ...dispels any notion you might have about shlocky science fiction.
4 ||| Iconic from the get-go.
4 ||| An enduring film property with an unforgettable catch phrase ('Klaatu barada nikto')...[and] socially conscious themes. [Blu-ray]
4 ||| A sci-fi classic that still resonates.
4 ||| Yes kids, media was idiotic and hysterical long before the likes of Glenn Beck were around.
4 ||| Hollywood doesn't make 'em like this anymore.
4 ||| Grim, strong drama about alcoholism with Lemmon and Remick's stellar work.
4 ||| Lemmon has given a sizable number of terrific performances over his career, and this one qualifies as a Top 10 entry. As for Remick, she's never been better.
0 ||| Despite the overwhelming demand for Treat Williams/Joe Piscopo team-ups, this effort remains surprisingly hard to find.
1 ||| A real stinker in 1988, and it hasn't improved with age.
1 ||| On the screen, it seems to be like a walking corpse itself: jerking around malevolently, with putrefying limbs, a fixed, grisly smile on its face and absolutely no spontaneity.
1 ||| Williams and Piscopo seem to be on autopilot when delivering their lines, not relating to one another, not picking up each other`s timing.
1 ||| A disastrous attempt at blending comedy and horror.
4 ||| Despite the omissions from Mann's text, dependence on flashbacks, and overwrought arguments about art and music between Aschenbach and a colleague, it remains a film of great beauty.
4 ||| They MAKE you watch it in English class for a good reason!
4 ||| A classic American tragedy.
4 ||| the kind of smart, upscale adult comedy-drama that would never get made these days
4 ||| Feels like a very good, very entertaining movie, but Grand Hotel feels like something truly special. However, the good in Dinner at Eight is very good indeed.
4 ||| A sparkling script and game efforts from an all-star cast easily overcome the creakiness.
4 ||| Scintillating '30s comedy with an all-star cast and quip-happy script.
4 ||| Often the dialogue is nearly as rich as the costumes and settings.
4 ||| Long, but lovely and romantic, and epic!
4 ||| David Lean masterpiece has great performances, sets
4 ||| Beautiful cinematography...and set design...together with excellent performances combine to form Zhivago's timeless appeal
4 ||| ...a passionate movie about passionate people in passionate times.
4 ||| Lean and Bolt pay tribute to a Tolstoyan ambition in Pasternak's samizdat novel, and also to a real contemporary relevance: the story of a suppressed writer.
4 ||| This adaptation of Boris Pasternak's classic novel has all the sweep and stateliness that characterised David Lean's mastery of the epic.
4 ||| A masterpiece of emotional resonance and melodramatic romanticism.
4 ||| Top line Warners western w/heroic Errol Flynn's guns blazin'!
4 ||| Dodge City spirited Errol Flynn away from his swashbuckling milieu and into a Wild West setting, and the match proved so natural that the Australian actor found himself cast in several more sagebrush sagas over the ensuing years.
1 ||| A very heart-driven horror movie, all things considered.
4 ||| One of the most strikingly creative films of its era. Mamoulian piles innovative approach on top of innovative approach with dizzying speed to create a movie unlike any other.
4 ||| Transformations still amaze; best version to date.
4 ||| Easily the best of the many versions of the Stevenson horror classic.
4 ||| Great effects for its time and some incredible performances makes this a true cinema classic.
4 ||| Dr Jekyll combines gothic horror, aristocratic romance and madcap Freudian psychodrama into a dizzying, exhilarating brew.
4 ||| While some of the dialogue and acting may now seem arch, this remains a standout take on the classic novel, visually inventive and often surprisingly strong given the era in which it was made.
4 ||| There has never been a more inventive nor engaging retelling of this classic story.
4 ||| In the middle of a frantic Christmas season, there is no better respite from the buy-me commercialism of the holidays than this short, but poignant story by Dr. Seuss.
4 ||| Christmas isn't Christmas without the Grinch.
4 ||| Like fine wine, it just gets better every darn year.
4 ||| I love Rankin-Bass, sure, but give me this any and every Christmas.
4 ||| It's the kind of weirdly clever, yet innocent and kid-friendly, product that forces me to use this tired clich -- they just don't make 'em like this any more
4 ||| Forget director Ron Howard's ill-conceived, live-action version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. The only cinematic take the story needed was released as an animated television special in 1966.
4 ||| Chuck Jones's wonderful 1966 television special remains a model of economy, taking Dr. Suess's simple tale and perfectly stretching it out to 26 minutes.
4 ||| Classic Christmas animated tale, a perennial on TV.
4 ||| Heartwarming TV special true to Seuss' classic.
4 ||| Its brightness, cleanness, tightness, and wit all go in to making it feel as fresh and alive as any other piece of animation from its generation.
4 ||| Bela Lugosi is inspired in the role of the vampire. One can no longer label it a good performance or a bad performance. Lugosi embodies the role.
4 ||| Creepily beautiful.
4 ||| Certainly it is Lugosi's performance, and the cinematography of Karl Freund, that make Tod Browning's film such an influential Hollywood picture.
4 ||| Still the best American take on the infamous bloodsucker.
4 ||| Bathed in an atmosphere of nightmare, dread and otherworldliness that is unlike anything else in American horror cinema.
4 ||| It haunted no one as much as dear Bela...
4 ||| Once you get into the rhythms of the film, you'll discover a masterpiece.
4 ||| All time horror classic starring Lugosi; still creepy as blazes.
4 ||| The casting is right on target and the atmosphere fittingly eerie in director John Badham's suspenseful, handsomely-mounted 1979 version.
4 ||| Dan Aykroyd steals the show with a hilarious impersonation and tribute to the stern-faced TV cop Joe Friday, played for more than a decade by Jack Webb.
1 ||| even Keaton can't make this clunker click
0 ||| Yet another Keaton-related disaster. Get this guy a new agent!
4 ||| a brilliant send-up of suspense and horror conventions that is, at the same time, extremely suspenseful and often vary scary
1 ||| Hitchcock-lite
4 ||| Brian De Palma is truly a great filmmaker. Whether you enjoy his work or hate his guts, you got to admit that he's at least brilliant at crafting impressive set pieces.
4 ||| Inflates paperback pulp psychology into something like a plot, all the better to demonstrate that filmmaking is an inherently visual storytelling.
4 ||| All dressed up with no script to go, but a feverish nerve jangler nonetheless.
4 ||| Eerily transcendent, Dressed to Kill is a layered machine of on-target character work and the sort of tension that only the best of the best filmmakers can ratchet.
4 ||| Dressed to Kill remains a prime example of how De Palma is able to marry his awesome technical prowess to the material, using his dazzling feats of cinematic derring-do to propel his stories rather than bury their weaknesses.
4 ||| A lurid film featuring throat-slashing, overheated lust, and a too-simple reduction of cross-dressing issues for pulpy purposes. But it also uses grand cinematic gestures to relay the dread and guilt of its characters to great effect.
1 ||| The murder mystery at the forefront is tiresomely plain and detached, even if viewers can't guess the culprit prior to the big reveal.
4 ||| A sign of great things yet to come.
4 ||| A singular idea executed to perfection
4 ||| Not even Hitchcock could have shot or paced Duel any better. Spielberg understands precisely where to insert his silences and pauses, and when to make them restful or tense. He knows how to pour it on for the exciting chase scenes.
4 ||| Superior made-for-TV thriller directed by Spielberg.
4 ||| An exquisite piece of streamlined suspense and action that clearly demonstrates that [Spielberg] was already in full control of his vision.
4 ||| The film pits the awesome talents of Richard Matheson ... with Spielberg, delivering one of the best genre films of the past 50 years.
4 ||| This is among the most flawless pieces of entertainment [Steven Spielberg] ever put his name to.
4 ||| Once you've seen it, you'll never forget it.
4 ||| let us contrast the Sci-Fi channel's unholy debacle with Lynch's masterpiece . . . Game, set, and match, to David Lynch . . . When will they learn to leave well enough alone?
1 ||| Several of the characters in Dune are psychic, which puts them in the unique position of being able to understand what goes on in the movie.
1 ||| This movie is a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion into the murkier realms of one of the most confusing screenplays of all time.
4 ||| If you think David Lynch is the Kwisatz Haderach, baby, have I got a movie for you.
4 ||| There's not a shred of humor in it, and it's a bleak look at humanity's future. But I was swept into the fantastic world.
4 ||| Crafted with meticulous precision and infinite patience, the film unfolds like a good novel, with compelling exposition eventually giving way to thrilling action.
4 ||| Overwrought, often splendid Kazan version of the Steinbeck novel. The movie's chief distinction is the amazing debut of rebellious, romantic James Dean.
4 ||| as exciting a drama as you're ever likely to see, and ultimately it's the unforgettable Dean that makes it so
4 ||| Not only one of Kazan's richest films and Dean's first significant role, it is also arguably the actor's best performance.
4 ||| What could be a better way to spend two hours?
4 ||| James Dean's finest performance
4 ||| Fine James Dean vehicle, one of few that put him into immortality.
4 ||| a reaction to our plutocracy's values and a further case for Dean as the sainted figure of rebellion that would fuel the generational schism of the '60s.
4 ||| After testing various performers (including a newcomer named Paul Newman), Kazan went with the unknown Dean, a move that immediately yielded dividends.
4 ||| Pasolini's rather straightforward style does occasionally mute the film's emotional impact.
4 ||| This tale of a pure soul struggling to be heard over the prejudice of the many is quite heart-rending.
4 ||| Avoids the obvious traps of simple romanticism and playing into sheer pity for Merrick's noble plight.
4 ||| My apologies to the fans of the absurd, but I'd call this David Lynch's one true masterpiece.
4 ||| Beautifully acted and photographed in absolutely gorgeous wide-screen black-and-white, the results are rarely less than stunning, despite the lapses into the melodramatic.
4 ||| The Elephant Man is a memorable film about human survival and a powerful commentary on human exploitation.
4 ||| Perhaps Lynch's finest moment -- Both disturbingly odd and surprisingly humane.
4 ||| This black-and-white film already includes several Lyncian benchmarks: hissing noises, nightmare sequences, and moments of deadly quiet.
4 ||| Has the look and texture of an authentic document, elevated by the hand of a artist with a singular vision
4 ||| One of the year's best films. Only DeNiro could take the Oscar away from John Hurt.
4 ||| A moving, faithful retelling of a bizarre true story.
4 ||| Heartbreaking drama isn't for sensitive viewers.
4 ||| This stylish, poignant drama is probably the closest director David Lynch has got to the mainstream outside of the disastrous Dune.
4 ||| It is an absorbing and satisfying drama, and Hurt's Merrick is very powerful.
4 ||| This is by far the most conventional of David Lynch's films, and thus perhaps it is the easiest with which to demonstrate his immense skill at narrative story-telling.
4 ||| With The Elephant Man, Lynch asserts his unique brand of empathetic storytelling - one that always balances the light with the dark, the good with the evil.
4 ||| Following his startling debut with Eraserhead, David Lynch retained that picture's industrial imagery, unnerving sound design, and oddball atmosphere and layered them over this rich story.
4 ||| I love this movie, yet I'm not sure if I respect it.
4 ||| The oppressive power of Carpenter's Scope framing is matched only by his ability to speak to contemporary affairs.
0 ||| Reagen-era horseshit.
4 ||| Its influence cannot be understated.
4 ||| Most of the images are elaborate confections of urban blight, etched against a nearly unlit soundstage, and the sound mix, until the finale, is rarely louder than Snake's elbow busting out an old windowpane.
4 ||| The movie proudly wears its affection for crusty Sergio Leone archetypes and countdown-clock suspense sequences; Carpenter was Tarantino long before Tarantino was.
4 ||| Snake is Carpenter's fantasy alter ego, a man of uncompromised anti-authoritarianism. 'I don't give a f--- about your war, or your President,' Snake tells the police commissioner, voicing a sentiment that was hardly unusual during Carpenter's USC days.
4 ||| In a time when New York may well have been at its most dangerous, or at least most volatile, John Carpenter came through with a nihilist vision of the city.
4 ||| A substandard-by-design, low-budget, accidental sci-fi epic that is too good to pass up.
4 ||| A stirring chronicle of Israel's struggle for independence in 1947.
1 ||| Peter Yates' initially promising thriller becomes a turgid trifle that wastes its '40s-noir-in-'80s-fashion premise. The only thing more anemic than its mystery or social commentary? Hurt and Weaver's sexual chemistry. Film at 11, asleep by 11:30.
4 ||| Weird, yes. And wonderful.
4 ||| It's a totally intelligent film with a great message, wonderfully presented by Truffaut, with the upmost competence.
4 ||| This is how you adapt a literary classic to the big screen.
4 ||| What's actually indicted is the human inclination towards the easy.
4 ||| trgico constatar que a viso de Bradbury vem tornando-se cada vez mais real: a diferena  que, em vez de queimados, os livros vm sendo simplesmente ignorados.
4 ||| A marvelously courageous personal statement that becomes more fascinating with time.
4 ||| Kevin Costner's Breakout Role, and the Road Trip to end all Road Trips.
4 ||| A perfect example of a film that captures the spirit of the source-material, whilst boldly exploiting and exploring the potential of the cinematic medium.
4 ||| One of the most entrancing and elemental landscape films ever shot in these isles.
4 ||| Christie carries the film with her own insouciant vulnerability. A classic.
4 ||| It has a kick that most other Hardy adaptations have conspicuously lacked.
4 ||| Quality oozes from every pore, with John Schlesinger's direction complemented by Frederic Raphael's sharp script and a cast that includes Julie Christie, Alan Bates, Peter Finch and a dastardly Terence Stamp.
4 ||| Mitchum makes a perfect Marlowe.
4 ||| Terrific casting, terrific noir thriller.
4 ||| Farewell, My Lovely is a great entertainment and a celebration of Robert Mitchum's absolute originality.
4 ||| Two absolutely riveting performances and a smart reversal of the usual male-female stalker scenario leave behind a nasty taste and an unforgettable cinema experience.
4 ||| Suspense at its finest. This is the granddaddy of erotic thrillers!
1 ||| It's nothing but a Friday the 13th flick for people who wouldn't be caught dead at one.
1 ||| This movie is pretty stupid, really. I only felt for the rabbit.
4 ||| Solid direction, ,thrilling set pieces, and an iconic performance from Glenn Close. It's a sleazy movie, but an extremely watchable one. The entertainment value for this one is very high.
4 ||| There are so many reasons Fatal Attraction is such a great film but first and foremost is the cast.
4 ||| Save for the horror-movie finale (which, despite being unforgettable, is something of a misstep), there's nothing too overblown or exaggerated about this harrowing duel.
4 ||| One of the best comedies MGM made in the 1950s.
4 ||| What makes the movie, and particularly Spencer Tracy's performance (arguably his finest), so exceptional is the manner in which it gently brings up the unavoidable heartbreak in this most enduring and celebrated of traditions.
4 ||| Camp classic of the colorful kind.
0 ||| a total bomb; an insult to the original serials; not even good camp.
0 ||| If only Ming the Merciless had turned his death ray on the producers...
4 ||| Quite possibly the greatest movie ever made, and I thoroughly distrust anyone who suggests otherwise.
4 ||| Taken solely as a pop wedge of cheese, it's beautifully realized. As for the empty-headed dialogue and the puerile plot, isn't it obvious those are both part of the point?
4 ||| a great camp classic
1 ||| ...a terminally underwhelming sci-fi epic that may keep small children amused, admittedly, but will leave adults bored to tears.
4 ||| While it's not the best of the sci-fi genre, you don't have to go to a galaxy far, far away to enjoy every minute of it.
4 ||| Director Mike Hodges' Flash Gordon is a wonderfully executed piece of science fiction cinema. It's a film which has become a much deserved cult classic since its original release way back in 1980.
4 ||| Brutally ugly and irresistably entertaining.
4 ||| This is a different kind of action movie, but it's all the better for it.
4 ||| A criminally underrated adventure classic.
4 ||| It's not hard to see the appeal of Robert Aldrich's The Flight of the Phoenix, a riveting adventure film featuring an all-star cast headed by Jimmy Stewart and Richard Attenborough.
4 ||| Fun and frightening.
4 ||| Like the very best monster movies, the creature itself isn't revealed until very late into the picture.
4 ||| Heartbreakingly sad. Disturbingly gory. Cronenberg's finest hour.
4 ||| Finally! A horror movie for adults!
4 ||| Where other Cronenberg films have collapsed under the heavy weight of their own ideas ... The Fly succeeds.
4 ||| Cronenberg at his peak, an artful and disturbing horror film blended with - of all things - a sharp romantic comedy.
4 ||| One of the saddest explorations of love and loss captured in one of the most underestimated films of the '80s.
4 ||| Cronenberg at the top of his form.
4 ||| The remake opts for a slow metamorphosis from man to fly that develops as a disease might. This gives Cronenberg time to examine the implications of such a process, meditating upon our fear of disease, death and change.
4 ||| A true horror classic. Goldblum's best screen performance.
4 ||| David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of the sci-fi schlockfest The Fly is celebrated as perhaps the most perfectly balanced of the director's pre-prestige films.
4 ||| Cronenberg's most triumphant and accessible film to date.
4 ||| The Fly is almost unique for a horror movie in that it compels us sympathize with and root for the characters.
4 ||| One of the greatest, horror or otherwise.
4 ||| Wildly imaginative, gut-wrenchingly scarifying and profoundly primal (not to mention funny), David Cronenberg's The Fly is a movie that whacks you in the solar plexus and leaves you gasping.
4 ||| As slimy and as grotesque as some of its special effects become, The Fly is a far superior horror film to the top-grossing film in America of late, Aliens.
4 ||| The Fly seizes on our ingrained, instinctive horror of sexuality, the sense of shame that our fundamentally puritanical society can't help but teach us, and by confirming our worst fears, helps us, for a moment, to move beyond them.
4 ||| At its best, the movie comes close to the power of classic tragedy.
4 ||| The Fly isn't a metaphor, it puts us directly in a messy science fiction situation where horror takes the reigns and flies away with them.
4 ||| For all its fetishistic attention to gross-out elements, what primarily distinguishes the film is its love story.
4 ||| It's still as frightfully vomitous, darkly humorous, and tragically beautiful as when it first premiered.
4 ||| I will always be grateful for the way this film has positively impacted my life.
4 ||| Embora assuma os contornos de um suspense mais tradicional (e eficiente, diga-se de passagem), Busca Frentica desenvolve um subtexto rico de significados.
4 ||| The film is filled with sight gags and features a wonderful performance by Harris.
4 ||| Scar-eeee!
4 ||| Tom Holland's directorial debut is a wildly entertaining concoction that perfectly blends horror and comedy. Roddy McDowall steals the show as TV horror host Peter Vincent.
4 ||| A minor classic of the genre, this is a memorable addition to the vampire tradition in the horror film.
4 ||| Underrated horror film is modern classic.
4 ||| Fright Night benefits from being one of the purest versions of horror-comedy. Both genres are equally represented without manipulation. The tropes of both combine to present real laughs with the terror and real terror with the laughs.
1 ||| As far as I can tell, every dumb guy in this movie has only himself to blame for all the stupid things that happen to him.
4 ||| A lavish, star-studded spectacle, much bowdlerized but redeemed by a slew of fine performances.
4 ||| Admittedly, it may be more of a guy's idea of a romantic film than a woman's. But it has a taut script and a letter-perfect cast.
4 ||| It's literally one great scene after another.
4 ||| Nothing's as romantic and steamy as the secret liaison ending up with the waves crashing on the half-naked bodies of Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr.
4 ||| Romantic masterpiece is old Hollywood at it's best.
4 ||| ...a macho movie with heart.
4 ||| So clear-eyed and three-dimensional that it makes the recent Pearl Harbor look like a bunch of kids playing dress up.
4 ||| One of the best of all time.
4 ||| There's no real "action" to speak of, aside from a few fistfights and the third act bombing attack, but From Here to Eternity sure isn't boring.
4 ||| Terrific performances from Montgomery Clift and Burt Lancaster highlight this limitedly involving romance.
4 ||| A seamless combination of high drama, romance and action.
4 ||| Director Fred Zinnemann's powerful adaptation of James Jones's bestseller won eight Oscars, upset the military and resurrected the acting career of Frank Sinatra.
4 ||| Fred Zinnemann's strength as a director was less on the technical side and more in line with coaxing stellar performances out of his actors, and with this film, he drew a royal flush.
4 ||| There isn't a dull moment in the picture.
4 ||| The human drama in the midst of wartime procedures and rank politics is astounding.
1 ||| although there are a Dick and a Jane, there is no fun whatsovever
4 ||| Funny Farm is one of those small miracles that starts out like a lot of other movies and then somehow finds its own way, step after step, to an original comic vision.
1 ||| Unwatchable.
1 ||| Tired '80s slapstick comedy has cursing, drinking.
4 ||| An often overlooked De Palma effort. A highly entertaining supernatural thriller with a number of visually stunning set pieces and an unforgettably explosive finish.
4 ||| The movie that draws the deepest line in the sand between De Palma apologists and De Palma maniacs.
4 ||| A hangout movie when all's said and done.
1 ||| Hilariously awful. Giant-worm rape not withstanding.
1 ||| A rip-off of Alien, this Roger Corman production has plenty of gore and a mindless storyline.
1 ||| Creature designs and copious amounts of goo look good (James Cameron served as a production designer), but they're unable to enhance a story this poorly arranged.
4 ||| ...a moving and memorable experience.
4 ||| A portrait of WWI that's both personal and epic.
4 ||| Regarded as one of the very best Australian film's ever made (with Mad Max and Picnic at Hanging Rock). Mel Gibson in one of first roles, and a touching but ultimately tragic tale of war.
4 ||| Both a fitting testimony to the courage of the thousands of Australians and New Zealanders who died fighting for their country and one of the most powerful cinematic examinations of the futility and tragic cost of war.
4 ||| Gallipoli remains one of the better World War I dramas yet made, well worth revisiting.
4 ||| Although we've seen this story before, it is told exceptionally well here.
4 ||| One of the most elegiac anti-war films ever made.
4 ||| A haunting and moving tribute to the Australians who sacrificed their lives in WWI.
4 ||| There was a humanity in Gallipoli that moved me because it wasn't just a clinical exercise but a story of 2 young men who wanted to run but ended up being unable to outrace the foolish decisions of their generals.
4 ||| Reisz, Caan, and screenwriter James Toback have constructed the character and the movie so convincingly that the scene not only works, but works two ways: first as suspense, and then as character revelation.
1 ||| To cash in on footage from a film Lee did not finish before his death, producer Chow puts in a double and uses out-takes for this kung-fu mess.
0 ||| An all around unfortunate and ill-conceived endeavor, it's a Lee feature for completists only.
4 ||| The General is inarguably Keaton's most stirring movie, if not his greatest.
4 ||| [Keaton's films] have such a graceful perfection, such a meshing of story, character and episode, that they unfold like music.
4 ||| There's no point sitting on the fence on this one. Buster Keaton's The General is a work of genius.
4 ||| Ranks among the greatest movies ever made.
4 ||| Newcomers will doubtless be surprised at the excellent pacing of the action.
4 ||| Its peerless mixture of exciting action and kinetic comedy are one of moviedom's supreme pleasures.
4 ||| Keaton's most ambitious and one of his most rewarding.
4 ||| Keaton at the top of his form.
4 ||| Perfection.
4 ||| Keaton's genius has never found more perfect expression.
4 ||| Silent classic is one of Keaton's best
4 ||| One of the greatest comedies ever produced. It is Keaton at his inventive best.
4 ||| Spectacular chases, fires and explosions are captured with fluid camerawork. There are no stunt doubles for Keaton and of course no digital effects.
4 ||| The birth of slapstick.
4 ||| Amongst the greatest of all silent comedies, The General isn't just important, it's bloody hilarious.
4 ||| The General isn't likely to be the favorite opus of the star's purist fans, but it's the one with the trappings of ambition and historical poesy
4 ||| Keaton proves as endlessly clever and athletic as his screen surrogates...chock-full of hilarious sight gags, including bits of business that incorporate moving trains, cow-catchers, a bear (and bear trap), and a misbehaving cannon. [Blu-ray]
4 ||| he General is the highlight of his career's tragicomic performances, featuring not just the awe-inspiring stunts that were his bread and butter, but also a level of fluidity only he and Chaplin attained at the top of their games.
4 ||| Silent masterpiece is enter-train-ment for all ages.
4 ||| A jaw-plunging blend of physical dexterity and bravura moviemaking.
4 ||| The film boasts the most sustained passages of virtuoso slapstick genius Keaton ever shot, and an unflagging momentum that lets it get away with being a reel longer than most of his best-known pictures.
4 ||| A hilarious comedy and a thrilling action film. The General has it all.
4 ||| In these times when all risk is assumed by CGI effects, Keaton's squealing funny, exquisitely timed, death-defying leaps are all the more breathtaking.
4 ||| Keaton has great sight gags and goes to amazing ends to get the thrills he wants.
4 ||| "The General" explores man's tumultuous relationship with technology through the propulsive images and rushing emotion available only to the advents of cinema.
4 ||| Not just one of the greatest films of the silent period, but of all time, and arguably the greatest comedy ever made.
4 ||| Like the train itself, The General rarely ever slows down, barreling from one hair-raising (and frequently hilarious) set-piece to the next.
4 ||| features gags that are as much artful exercises in stuntwork and timing as they are orchestrated attempts at humor, and the fact that they work so well as both is testament to Keaton's brilliance as a filmmaker and performer
4 ||| Artistic perfection. [February 19, 2019]
4 ||| The movie is one death-defying stunt piece after another, and each is jaw-dropping by even today's standards.
4 ||| One of the greatest of all silent films.
4 ||| The peak of silent cinema.
4 ||| Relentlessly depicts ruthless robbery and murder, not to mention adultery, kidnaping, bribery, extortion, and general mayhem. The vivid direction and lightning pace, however, make the film completely fascinating.
1 ||| John Cassavetes made some iffy movies during his career, but none is worse than the original Gloria.
4 ||| Cassavetes may have thought Gloria was nothing more than commercial trash, but what he did instead was take trash and turn it into art.
4 ||| Other films can mimic its style and story, but what they can't replicate is the chemistry between its leads..
4 ||| A strong and valuable film.
4 ||| One of the greatest films ever made.
4 ||| An absolutely phenomenal war movie.
4 ||| Glory is, without question, one of the best movies ever made about the American Civil War.
4 ||| An enlightening and entertaining tribute to heroes too long forgotten.
4 ||| The lasting power of the [film]... rests in the emotional connection to the characters .
4 ||| Still one of the best war epics ever made, with all around fantastic performances...
4 ||| In its broad strokes, Glory gets at the spirit of a group of previously unsung black heroes, and the filmmaking is of a high caliber. [Blu-ray]
4 ||| one of the great war films and perhaps the greatest film ever made about the American Civil War
4 ||| "Glory" is most memorable for some quieter scenes... that capture more elusive aspects of its story - and that help audiences to grasp the underlying significance of what the 54th achieved.
1 ||| Emblematic of the underside of 70s American film.
4 ||| Robert Donat is deeply affecting as the title character.
4 ||| Inspirational, touching, classic work with Robert Donat's Oscar winning performance.
1 ||| The color is rich, the photography superb, and the atmospherics of the roaring twenties are realistically and stunningly in evidence in this film version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece novel, but that's it.
4 ||| Everything a farce should be, played straight while being seriously silly.
1 ||| A monumentally epic disaster...
0 ||| The Green Berets simply will not do as a film about the war in Vietnam. It is offensive not only to those who oppose American policy but even to those who support it.
1 ||| The meager plot follows the bear as it lumbers about slicing up tourists--and not just to get their picnic baskets--pursued by a heroic forest ranger (George) and a naturalist (Jaeckel).
4 ||| ...most notable for the signature Fleischer touches: comic violence; irritable, oval-eyed characters; a general preference for anarchy over order.
4 ||| Good movie about the consequences of our choices.
4 ||| It's expertly assembled classic western fodder, and the template for every elegiac "retired killer" movie to come - from Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven to Hugh Jackman in Logan.
4 ||| One of the best westerns from the 1950s - a decade replete with magnificent westerns.
4 ||| Hairspray might be tame by the director's standards, but it loses none of its subversive energy in its quest for a PG-rating.
4 ||| One of the great films of the '80s and as close to perfect as Waters has gotten
4 ||| A perfect mixture of old trashy Waters and a new kinder, gentler Waters.
4 ||| Certainly Waters would argue that all his films end on an upbeat note. But [Hairspray] is the first time the joy seems genuine, not just perversely plastered on.
4 ||| Controversial filmmaker John Waters finally hits his commercial stride in this film, parlaying his keen social observation and great compassion for society's outsiders into a colorful and engaging comedy full of dancing, music and heartfelt nostalgia.
4 ||| If you've only seen it on network television or it's been more than a few years, do yourself a favour and rediscover this one soon.
4 ||| Halloween remains untouched -- a modern classic of the most horrific kind.
4 ||| flawless for what it is: a completely immersive, visceral dynamo of stylistic belly-jiggling and spine-shivering.
4 ||| Arguably, the greatest horror film of the past thirty years.
4 ||| very possibly no other seminal seventies film--not The Godfather, not Star Wars, perhaps not even Jaws--has had a greater influence on popular culture.
4 ||| Even after repeated viewings, Carpenter's minor masterpiece holds up as a staunchly effective thriller that will always stand head and shoulders above the cinematic progeny it spawned.
4 ||| One of the first and the flat-out best of that ghetto of the horror film genre, the slasher movie.
4 ||| Halloween is an absolutely merciless thriller, a movie so violent and scary that, yes, I would compare it to Psycho.
4 ||| One of the scariest movies ever made.
4 ||| Halloween brilliantly uses its widescreen frame, a lot of hand-held camerawork, and scary foreground and background action.
4 ||| A modern horror classic.
4 ||| Regardless of how silly you think it all is, this will have you scared witless by the time the end credits roll; low budget horror hog heaven.
4 ||| The movie itself is repressed; Hitchcock would have admired the way Carpenter artfully avoids explicit bloodshed.
4 ||| John Carpenter and Debra Hill's film is a genuine landmark in the horror-thriller genre.
4 ||| Virtually perfect. It is the one horror film that I would beg each and every lover of movies to watch, if I could pick only one.
4 ||| To call Halloween merely brilliant isn't giving it enough credit. As a horror film and as a historical milestone that single-handedly shaped and altered the future of an entire genre, it's downright transcendent.
4 ||| A seminal slasher that gets better with age.
4 ||| Well worth another look on the big screen.
4 ||| [A] simple but horribly effective low-budget suburban horror ...
4 ||| Still relevant. Still scary. Make a date on Halloween night to witness cinema's scariest Michael Myers (unless you've seen The Love Guru) causing carnage on the big screen.
4 ||| Halloween still remains the greatest horror film of all time.
4 ||| Why Halloween works is because even in its minute flaws, there's an inherent charm to the basic effectiveness and fundamental workmanship on display & it's hard to say that about many films who have tried to follow in its footsteps ever since.
4 ||| You'll likely be full appreciative of just how stunning a movie Halloween is.
4 ||| The horror genre can often (rightfully) be maligned. Many of the films within the genre are cheap exploitation films, whose filmmakers care more about monetary return than crafting a great movie.
4 ||| ...most compelling as a metaphorical manifestation of Laurie Strode's sexual fears.
4 ||| The beginning of the franchise is a masterpiece of horror which every aspiring filmmaker should see. [Full review in Spanish]
4 ||| Not just the gold standard for American horror, but one of the greatest achievements in cinematic history.
4 ||| The quintessential popcorn horror film, a thrill ride with few equals.
4 ||| Halloween remains one of the most frightening films ever released.
4 ||| Olivier's direction of the film is inspired.
4 ||| a bold, well-paced tragedy that helped expand audience notions of what Shakespeare on screen could be like
4 ||| It is everything that it should be: beautiful and haunting, powerful and ultimately tragic.
4 ||| The best ever adaptation of Shakespeare's best ever play. Olivier is mesmerising.
4 ||| A valuable classic.
4 ||| Laurence Olivier directed and stars in this astonishing Shakespeare adaptation.
4 ||| Altogether Hamlet is one of the most impressive films ever made and, so far as Shakespeare's work is concerned, it need never be done again on stage nor for the screen, as the Olivier production... may stand for all time as THE Hamlet.
4 ||| A striking achievement for an actor/director who would continue to helm and star in Shakespeare's works.
0 ||| An increasingly interminable misfire...
4 ||| Hardcore, flawed and uneven, contains moments of pure revelation.
4 ||| ...a compelling and often shocking drama that also succeeds as a time capsule of a very specific time and place.
4 ||| The very first response to "What's a good haunted house movie?"
4 ||| One of the all-time creepy classics. Don't miss it.
4 ||| One super-creepy haunted house story -- and quite possibly the most stylish picture Robert Wise ever made.
4 ||| Without showing one ghost, Wise's camera works like a contorting black and white swallow.
4 ||| ...it's what we don't see in The Haunting that makes it scary.
4 ||| The scariest movie of its day
4 ||| Ghosts! And they are unseen, frightening things in this creepy classic.
4 ||| few filmmakers have drawn fright from nothingness as adeptly as Robert Wise did
4 ||| An undeniably effective adaptation of the Shirley Jackson novel and remains one of the best haunted-house movies.
4 ||| Borderline perfect... Strip away all of its frightening elements, and the film remains a sophisticated, complex, and tremendously subtle character study.
4 ||| This is one of the best supernatural chillers ever made.
4 ||| Wise brilliantly uses black and white widescreen to strand his characters in odd-shaped rooms or corridors, making the watcher's eye skitter frantically over the letterbox screen to catch every ingeniously rendered detail.
4 ||| As a director Beatty has a light touch. He keeps the story moving briskly along. The movie never gets very serious and yet you care about the characters.
4 ||| God, how I love this movie.
4 ||| This classic children's film, expertly directed by Allan Dwan, is wonderfully entertaining, with moppet Temple at her adorable best.
4 ||| Full of chases, near captures, sword fights, and epic battles, as well as plenty of humor, both of the slapstick and wordplay varieties.
4 ||| The Hidden Fortress effortlessly intertwines action, drama, and comedy.
4 ||| By introducing comedy into the mixture and telling the tale from an atypical perspective, Kurosawa has differentiated The Hidden Fortress from nearly every similar feudal era Japanese epic ever committed to the screen. This is a masterpiece.
4 ||| Kurosawa reminds us that he really is the best Samurai movie director ever ... There are many laugh out loud moments, and the film also bears some of Kurosawa's finest action sequences.
4 ||| [An] exciting adventure epic.
4 ||| I enjoyed The Hidden Fortress as I do all of Kurosawa's movies...for those wonderful, keenly felt moments of life in harmonious balance with the world surrounding it
4 ||| a masterpiece of composition, atmosphere, and subtext.
4 ||| Kurosawa stages every scene with an eye toward screen-filling spectacle, [...] But he's also concerned with the characters' journey, and how they change-or don't-along the way.
4 ||| The play of light and dark elements in what's arguably Akira Kurosawa's most broadly appealing and entertaining picture...explores a dichotomy of the idiocy of greed and the rewards of sacrifice. [Criterion Blu-ray]
4 ||| For all its scale, it is at its heart a "nerd" comedy
4 ||| Mifune shines and invigorates what remains secondary Kurosawa (less rewarding than Throne), but a solid primal adventure in its own right.
4 ||| Even in the moments of levity, cleverness works its way into forms of manipulation, trickery, and lucky escapes.
4 ||| Craven's best movie that doesn't have the word "Texas" in the title.
4 ||| One of the prime examples of the what was so fascinating about American horror films in the 1970s.
1 ||| The Hindenburg is a disaster picture, all right. How else can you describe a movie that cost $12 million and makes people laugh out loud at all the wrong times?
4 ||| 'The Hit' gives the great Terence Stamp what is arguably his best role.
1 ||| It's a film that's about as funny and/or scary as a lump of sod.
4 ||| This is a smartly written and acted and exceptionally well-directed movie.
1 ||| Throughout the film's three interconnected stories, Jim O'Hanlon favors the blunt, maudlin manipulations of Crash.
1 ||| Jim O'Hanlon's drama offers forgettable performances and mediocre BBC One-level melodrama.
4 ||| Great mystery, sparked by superbly cast stars
4 ||| This classic is no dog!
4 ||| Vivid, exciting Hammer production.
4 ||| Cushing is splendid as Holmes -- perhaps less eccentric than other screen Holmes but certainly no less committed -- while it's nice to see Lee in a rare good-guy role.
4 ||| This is my favorite of the movies adapted from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel, and the first one in color.
1 ||| May a house fall on the director's sister.
1 ||| Mediocre horror.
4 ||| Joyfully macabre.
4 ||| Arguably the best of all 3-D movies.
4 ||| House of Wax is not particularly scary or suspenseful, but it is a lot of fun and effectively creates an atmosphere of dread using bright colors and shadows.
4 ||| It's a heckuva lot of fun.
4 ||| Unlike many 3D films from the original push in the 1950s, House of Wax stands on its own without the gimmick.
4 ||| House of Wax has gone down in the books as a classic, but now, finally, it can be appreciated in the form it was always meant to be seen in. There is no need to ever watch it in 2D again.
4 ||| The film's place in cinema history is already secured as it's genuinely one of the best of the fifties horror thrillers from Warner Bros, with Price at his best - being both sympathetic and sinister.
4 ||| Hud understands that torches are more often extinguished than passed
4 ||| A blistering adult western which broke ground in its depiction of an unglamorous West and in the decidedly anti-heroic nature of its lead.
4 ||| ...a Western Gothic, where everyone is headed for trouble.
4 ||| One of the best silent films ever made. Chaney's makeup is still incredible.
4 ||| Absolutely chilling, sad, awesome Chaney
4 ||| Lon Chaney's Quasimodo is one of early cinema's most forlorn and tragic movie monsters, on par with King Kong and Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's creation.
4 ||| This classic silent film will appeal to teens.
4 ||| It's held up remarkably well.
4 ||| An awe-inspiring achievement, featuring magnificent sets (built on the Universal backlot), the proverbial cast of thousands (the crowd scenes are mesmerizing) and an opportunity to catch Lon Chaney at his most commanding.
4 ||| Despite being 95 years old, it remains a classic. It also marks a true beginning of Universal Monster Films that would come to define horror for decades.
4 ||| Don't rent the Disney one by mistake.
4 ||| Gorgeous, brilliant, nearly flawless. Easily the best version
4 ||| Director William Dieterle manages a difficult task well, creating a film of both great sweep and remarkable intimacy.
4 ||| Laughton is excellent as the misshapen bellringer, cowering in the presence of that patron saint of today's Men's Rights Activists, the misogynistic hypocrite Frollo (Sir Cedric Hardwicke).
1 ||| ...plays like nothing more than a vanity project for star Burt Reynolds.
1 ||| With the exception of Robert Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly, all Hammer films have been disappointments. This version of I, the Jury is no exception.
4 ||| Sirk's subversive use of the excesses of melodrama have established him as one of the most significant directors to have worked in Hollywood, even if he was not recognised as such at the time.
1 ||| Trashy remake of John M. Stahl's 1934 classic
4 ||| Sirk immediately and deliberately acknowledges the film's metaphoric, almost pathological obsession with surfaces.
4 ||| You'll be horrified at how this hokum manipulates you, but the best strategy is to just surrender and enjoy it.
4 ||| A consummate display of populist weepie-making.
4 ||| Asquith, an expert in comedy ..., knows just how to let Wilde's drawing-room farce play out to maximum effectiveness with a minimum of intrusion
4 ||| Civilized comedy has never been more civilized -- or as preposterously funny.
4 ||| It doesn't get much better than this.
4 ||| The perfect cast - Michael Redgrave, Michael Denison, Margaret Rutherford - and the perfect director (Anthony Asquith) know just how seriously (not very) to take this amoral satire on society's falsity.
4 ||| Despite a few tweaks to Oscar Wilde's frighteningly witty play, director and writer Anthony Asquith serves up a truly delightful screen version of "The Importance of Being Earnest."
1 ||| a laugh riot -- unintentionally, of course
4 ||| Brooks' great achievement in the film is to portray Smith and Hickock as the unexceptional, dim-witted, morally adrift losers they were.
4 ||| Excellent quasidocumentary, which sends shivers down the spine while moving the viewer to ponder.
4 ||| This movie is so good I moved to Kansas!
4 ||| Adaptao impecvel do clssico de Capote,  um filme psicologicamente denso, soberbamente montado e dirigido e que traz Blake e Wilson em atuaes inesquecveis.
4 ||| A sociological crime drama that plays like a noose tightening around all our necks.
4 ||| Hall's bleak vision, his gift for working with darkness and rain, rivals classic film noir of the 1940s and '50s in its visual mastery.
4 ||| Exquisitely photographed in wide-screen black-and-white by Conrad Hall.
4 ||| One of the most creditable true-crime films ever made. [Blu-ray]
4 ||| It's both a "true crime" movie and a poetic account of two young men who, by committing an act of unspeakable brutality, unleash the furies against themselves.
4 ||| Writer-director Richard Brooks' detached style allows for a non-exploitative presentation, and the contributions by cinematographer Conrad Hall and composer Quincy Jones are first-rate.
4 ||| Sophisticated Donen boasts star power of Grant and Bergman.
4 ||| One of those rare movies that is far better than the play from which it was adapted.
4 ||| Nearly as good as its reputation
4 ||| Among John Ford's first great films; w/Oscar turn by McLaglen.
4 ||| Extraordinarly vivid, rich, and wise about the core questions of how we know and who we are.
1 ||| Director Kramer at his most unbearably high-minded and ostentatious
4 ||| An all time classic
4 ||| Absorbing, if long-winded courtroom drama bolstered by two fine central performances from Tracy and March.
4 ||| Stagey yes, but powerful Tracy and March acting + subject matter make this a must see.
4 ||| Knock-out courtroom drama has deft comic touches.
4 ||| Stanley Kramer's 1960 film is a searing indictment of religious fundamentalism and anti-intellectualism. Inherit the Wind's relevance continues beyond its immediate parallels with McCarthyism.
4 ||| One can't help but feel that two of the stories would stand better on their own.
4 ||| As a concept and a milestone of film, its greatness is undeniable.
4 ||| D.W. Griffith wants to fight for your right to party.
4 ||| The film presents its stories on the grandest of scales, sparing no expense in re-creating the period, and especially the monstrous Babylonian sets.
4 ||| Intolerance's sets, costumes, compositions, and mass deployment of bodies in motion are often impressive, especially in the battle of Babylon sequence.
4 ||| Intolerance is thrilling and vital, a collision of historical periods that feels as earth-shaking as the movement of tectonic plates.
4 ||| Intolerance is undoubtedly cinematic paradigm, but more than this, it's a window through which we can peer 100 years into the past.
4 ||| Reinforces director D.W. Griffith's place as a master crafter of grandiose cinema, while also serving as something of a response to the criticisms of his previous epic.
1 ||| a clunky remake that fails to frighten
1 ||| Shapeless 80s horror; a drag despite a hip pedigree.
4 ||| Wonderfully performed and imbued with a genuine sense of trepidation and unease.
4 ||| The grandfather of all paranoid thrillers
4 ||| I still believe in the reality of pod people.
4 ||| Chilling still. Do not fall asleep while watching it!
4 ||| Tenso e bem construdo, conta com uma tima trilha sonora, a direo expressiva de Siegel e com um roteiro que pode ser lido como uma alegoria clara do mccarthismo.
4 ||| Siegel's brilliant movie sits as a perfect bookend to Romero's "Night Of The Living Dead."
4 ||| Some genuinely creepy moments and good social commentary raise this horror film
4 ||| An all time classic. The "message" was lost on most original viewers.
4 ||| A 50s horror classic that remains a gem of allegorical paranoia.
4 ||| A superbly crafted film by innovative director Siegel, this low-budget science fiction tale became one of the great cult classics of the genre.
4 ||| One of the very best sci-fi/horror pictures of one of that genre's best decades.
4 ||| Among the most thrilling cliffhangers in all of cinema.
4 ||| Don Siegel's taut, bleak, noir-flavoured picture is arguably the science-fiction B-movie of the 1950s, an age when screens glowed with the atomic threat and undulated with scuttling, supersized bugs.
4 ||| Although expertly remade twice - in 1978 and 1993 - and rather less successfully in 2007, the original is still the most striking, with a justly famous scalp-freezing ending.
4 ||| This modest, sci-fi-inflected 1956 horror movie may come to be seen as the defining metaphorical work of the twentieth century.
4 ||| The modest budget and B-list stars (Kevin McCarthy, Dana Wynter) - enhance the movie's impact, and Don Siegel's taut direction makes the sheer ordinariness of the setting all the more scary.
4 ||| A movie that can claim kinship with Alberto Cavalcanti's Went the Day Well? as well as The Matrix and Under the Skin.
4 ||| Brilliantly placed, however unwittingly, to illustrate America's political paranoia from both ends.
4 ||| Watch it in the cinema and you'll find yourself gazing warily at everyone else in your row.
4 ||| [This movie] scares the holy piss out of me.
4 ||| The film's brilliance lies in the way it splits the difference between the horror and sci-fi, turning the potential wonders of outer space into a nightmare about inner space
4 ||| Don Siegel's lean, efficient masterwork of paranoia has never looked better thanks to a gorgeous restoration that vividly brings the black and white terror to your home.
4 ||| This remains not only the best of the adaptations but also one of the best horror/sci-fi films ever made.
4 ||| A daring, tragic, influential, adventurous, utterly perfect blend of smart sci-fi and creeping dread.
4 ||| Personally I think this version to be superior to the original and to be much underrated by both critics and audiences.
4 ||| The screenplay by W.D. Richter builds at a deliberate pace, and within the first half hour we're already disturbed by the almost imperceptible behavior of those who have been snatched.
4 ||| ...what if the mask of your neighbor tilts for a second and you catch a glimpse of the riot going on behind his face?
4 ||| This will read less like a review and more like a valentine, but this is a very, very special film, a forgotten classic of the '70s cinema.
4 ||| A cerebral and suspenseful film of foreboding atmosphere. On a short list of truly outstanding remakes.
4 ||| A superior sci-fi thriller that makes even raindrops, plants and electrical cords take on sinister life.
4 ||| If not quite as great as its predecessor, still a pretty damn fine genre picture.
4 ||| one of the great sci-fi horrorshows, a movie that gooses you with its premise, makes you laugh and jump, and ultimately leaves you with something you can't quite shake
4 ||| Very entertaining, and despite the by now over familiar-plot, pleasantly suspenseful.
4 ||| This terrific remake never lets the audience forget that it should be frightened.
4 ||| one of the best remakes ever
4 ||| Emotionally stirring, visually striking and having not aged a day, "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" cries out for individuality in a skewed, nightmarish totalitarian reality. The results are as squirmily potent in 2016 as they no doubt were in 1978.
4 ||| The 1956 Invasion of the Body Snatchers remains the best of the four adaptations, but this second take is similarly noteworthy and continues to grow in stature over the years.
4 ||| A wonderful, insightful, goofy, bizarre look at a strange case.
4 ||| The many special effects -- some retouched on film by hand -- are quaint by today's digital standards, but that only makes them all the more fun.
4 ||| This pitch black comedy in horror-movie clothing is certainly one of Whale's best films, and one of his most accomplished, making it one of the great classics in any genre.
4 ||| Repleto de momentos deliciosamente bem-humorados (obra de James Whale), o filme tem bons efeitos visuais - mesmo para os padrões atuais - e uma performance marcante, mesmo que "invisível", de Claude Rains.
4 ||| By turns hilarious, haunting and horrific.
4 ||| Great black & white fantasy film.
4 ||| Overacted but holds on pretty well though.
4 ||| Rains, whose expressive gestures are also vital to his performance, recognised it as a career-making opportunity, a whole film that builds up to the revelation of his face.
4 ||| The success of this superb adaptation of HG Wells's novel is down to John P Fulton and John J Mescall's pioneering special effects and the eerie atmosphere conjured up by horror maestro James Whale.
1 ||| Another one of Caine's big bombs!!
1 ||| Laughable remake of Island of Lost Souls.
1 ||| Mais uma tentativa fracassada de se adaptar o livro homnimo de H.G. Wells, esta verso traz Burt Lancaster no piloto automtico e Michael York pouco convincente como o incrdulo heri.
1 ||| Miscast Lancaster fails to be a compelling figure - either tragic or malevolent - and the entire film collapses around him.
4 ||| It's all very standard romantic-fantasy stuff, but it moves with the rhythm of a hot jazz tune, and Bow lights up every moment she's onscreen.
4 ||| The pacing is swift, the expressions priceless, and the confrontational, situational comedy uproarious.
4 ||| One part allegory on familial tensions and one part commentary on environmental and biological poisoning.
1 ||| ...the picture slowly-but-surely loses its grip on the viewer as it progresses into an often unbearably meandering midsection...
1 ||| I could do while watching it was giggle.
4 ||| Luxe MGM historical ransacking, locationed to the nines, beautiful to look upon, but with energy lapses in the soggy script of Sir Walter Scott's epic classic.
1 ||| Fee, fi, fo, flop!
4 ||| The film's engaging use of Greek mythology, entertaining supporting performances (the star, Todd Armstrong, is a bit bland), and outstanding model work (A six-headed Hydra! Seven fencing skeletons!) make it an ideal collector's classic.
4 ||| In a cinema landscape populated with all kinds of digitally created creatures and setpieces, it's nice to take a look back and witness the birth of these ideas.
4 ||| What a blast!
4 ||| But what puts it over the top is a strange sense of melancholy pervading the machismo heroics.
4 ||| There's one thing that neither Neil Diamond nor Danny Thomas nor even Jerry Lewis had in their versions: the unrivaled showmanship and charisma of Al Jolson.
1 ||| An overrated cinematic turd, and an embarrassment to Jazz.
1 ||| The Jazz Singer is a shallow attempt by a powerful group of straying Jews to clear their consciences.
1 ||| An unintentional laff riot. Olivier is so over the top that it's mesmerizing.
1 ||| Mr. Diamond, looking glum and seldom making eye contact with anyone, isn't enough of a focus for the outmoded story.
1 ||| The Jazz Singer has so many things wrong with it that a review threatens to become a list.
1 ||| The third and, one hopes, final remake of THE Jazz Singer is the least interesting attempt so far.
4 ||| If only all biblical films could be this groovy.
1 ||| Surely a candidate for the worst stage-to-screen musical adaptation ever.
4 ||| Powerful Jane Wyman performance and Oscar caliber production overall.
1 ||| ...an entirely ineffective curiosity that's best left forgotten.
4 ||| While Brando's is scene stealing and Gielgud's is masterful, Mason's is emotional.
4 ||| Lavish, starstruck and for the most part, splendid.
4 ||| Brando, Gielgud and Mason are slightly superb.
4 ||| Brando actually addresses the crowd he is speaking to, his searing eyes picking out stragglers and cutting them down
1 ||| We begin to suspect... that the movie is an alien plot to drain the soul from mighty Shakespeare.
0 ||| Kansas...is a really terrible movie.
1 ||| As welcome in its title state as a rash of tornadoes.
1 ||| The final moments of the match are so poorly edited and ludicrous in structure that they contribute to unintentional, laugh-out-loud hilarity.
1 ||| Sam Peckinpah knows how to make movies but perhaps he has forgotten why.
4 ||| If you don't...see [The King and I], believe us, you'll be missing a grand and moving thing.
4 ||| Classic performances, classic score, the best Rodgers & Hammerstein screen adaptation.
4 ||| Tuneful, mesmerizing (Brynner) R&H musical
4 ||| The popular pick for the best Rodgers and Hammerstein musical is probably The Sound of Music, but I'm throwing in for The King and I.
4 ||| A chronicle of colonialism that poses itself as an easy-to-dismiss artifact, yet reveals itself to be an enduring statement about why people can't get along.
4 ||| Starring Yul Brynner in the part he seemed born to play, this is a fine if slightly stage-bound example of the 1950s Hollywood musical spectacular.
4 ||| King Kong was created to grip and thrill like no movie before, and these basic principles hold surprisingly true today.
4 ||| Even allowing for its slow start, wooden acting and wall-to-wall screaming, there is something ageless and primeval about King Kong that still somehow works.
4 ||| King Kong es el termómetro obligado con el que se miden todas las películas de monstruos gigantes; desde los voraces velociraptors hasta la maternal Godzilla
4 ||| The film is everything solid entertainment of the sort should be -- exciting, thrilling, weirdly convincing and finally mythic.
4 ||| While Kong is, in most scenes, only an 18-inch studio model, the stop motion special effects are so intelligently accomplished and lovingly detailed that the animated gorilla often appears more expressive than the human actors.
4 ||| Still to this day it doesn't come off as cheesy and that's because the filmmakers never approached it as such.
4 ||| Though the story's logic is ludicrous if one ever stops to think about it, the movie creates a reality all its own.
4 ||| It's gonna be hard for Jackson to top this one!
4 ||| In much the same manner as The Wizard of Oz and It's a Wonderful Life, it long ago entered into the national consciousness as an enduring part of our heritage.
4 ||| One of the finest adventure movies ever made and the true prototype for all monster movies to follow, KING KONG is, even after 83 years, still the one true ruler of high-end escapist cinema.
4 ||| The beauty of this original King Kong is that there's more to it than the oversized gorilla.
4 ||| A brilliantly structured adventure movie.
4 ||| In many ways, Kong is still king.
4 ||| It's one of the rare, great works of art that stands up to endless repeated viewings, each time revealing something new.
4 ||| 'King Kong died for our sins.' It's a T-shirt seen recently in Seattle, worn by a teenager and illustrated with the original vintage image of the monster ape atop the Empire State Building.
4 ||| All these years on from its original release, King Kong still has a great claim to being the eighth wonder of the world.
4 ||| ...throbbing with metaphorical implications. The riveting, stop-motion battle between the great ape and a T. Rex is just a bonus.
4 ||| Arguably the monster movie of all time, this abiding take on Beauty and the Beast has a mythic power that belies its years.
4 ||| Probably the most perfect popcorn movie movie ever made by a Hollywood studio.
0 ||| Rent the real thing.
1 ||| Awful in nearly every respect; stick with the original!
1 ||| Without a doubt, De Laurentiis' remake of Cooper and Schoedsack's classic is the biggest con job ever pulled on the unsuspecting American public.
1 ||| If this is what bleeding-edge, Oscar-worthy effects work looked like in 1976, it's no wonder that Star Wars made such a gargantuan splash in 1977.
0 ||| This revisitation presented the opportunity for grander spectacle and greater excitement, yet the direction turned instead toward calculated campiness and outright comedy.
4 ||| "twisted, scary satire that was far ahead of its time"
4 ||| Scorsese's magnum opus 'til Kundun came along.
4 ||| Probably Martin Scorsese's most overlooked movie, this eerie parody of celebrity culture features what may be Jerry Lewis' best performance.
4 ||| It's very funny, and it ends on a high note that was, for me, both a total surprise and completely satisfying. Yet it's also bristly, sometimes manic to the edge of lunacy and, along the way, terrifying.
4 ||| A chilling black comedy.
4 ||| This bizarre work is one of Martin Scorsese's greatest and most underrated films.
4 ||| One of the most disturbing, thought-provoking and funniest films of the 1980s. This underappreciated Scorsese great is more relevant today than ever.
4 ||| Beautifully dark and original.
4 ||| Fascinating drama with DeNiro as psycho, talk show wannabe, and Jerry Lewis giving great performance.
4 ||| This jet-black comedy is a symphony of unease.
4 ||| ...cringe comedy of the highest order.
4 ||| With laughs that feel more self-inflicted than involuntary, The King of Comedy is an incredibly eerie film to experience. [August 28, 2018]
4 ||| Cringy, awkward, painful to watch -a masterpiece.
4 ||| The film is perfect, as much for its performances and its sheer un-comfortableness.
4 ||| An epic of considerable scope, filled with broad vistas, yet there are enough intimate moments to give audience a chance to engage with the characters rather than just admire their pontificating.
4 ||| A real treasure, and not shown often enough these days
4 ||| Classic of its adventure genre--colorful, exciting.
4 ||| This is one of Hitchcock's finest British films, a classic mystery that manages to combine humor with a genuine sense of menace -- not to mention the kinds of characters that everyone dreams of meeting on a Central European train journey.
4 ||| One of Hitch's best from his rich British period
4 ||| What separates Lady Vanishes
4 ||| Accept no substitutes for this blissful original.
4 ||| Sheer stylish entertainment and a joy from start to finish.
4 ||| Naturally, nobody builds suspense like 'The Master', but the appealing team of Lockwood and Redgrave receves sterling back-up from twinkly Dame May and Cecil Parker as the spineless adulterer.
4 ||| Maybe the best of Hitchcock's early, pre-USA productions.
4 ||| A pleasure.
4 ||| this director at this moment in his career, back when he was still more clever than cruel.
4 ||| A snappy, witty, dryly funny testament to British perseverance and tea time that cannot and should not be ignored when discussing the master's finest work.
4 ||| a wonderfully macabre comedy
4 ||| Wildly funny!
4 ||| The best of the Ealing comedies.
4 ||| Nothing else like it.
4 ||| One of the great Ealing comedies of the 1950s.
4 ||| The architecture of the film - and buildings and angles are an integral part of why it works so well - rests upon the twin pillars of Katie Johnson and Alec Guinness.
4 ||| This film does a wonderful job of combining dark humor and classic British comedy.
4 ||| Preminger's deft direction creates an elegant noirish tone, and he elicits near-perfect performances from everyone, even a pre-Horror Schlock Vincent Pryce.
4 ||| A truly haunting study of obsession.
4 ||| Both old and new viewers are in for a treat.
4 ||| The materials of a B-grade crime potboiler are redeemed by Waldo Lydecker, walking through every scene as if afraid to step in something.
4 ||| Did Hollywood ever produce a more seductive mystery or a creepier romance? I wouldn't change a line, a frame, or a performance in this film.
4 ||| A classic murder film worth seeing over and over.
4 ||| A masterfully complex -- and frequently campy -- portrait of all-consuming romantic self-delusion.
4 ||| A genuine classic -- not only of film noir but of film, period -- director Otto Preminger's adaptation of Vera Caspary's novel lathers the murder-mystery with a heavy dollop of kinkiness.
4 ||| This kooky film noir is so beautifully directed by Otto Preminger that all its protruding elements seem to slide delicately and accurately into place.
4 ||| Just watching Clifton Webb's deliciously nasty performance, as the effete critic and Laura's mentor, delivering the film's best lines, is worth the price of admission
4 ||| A classic noir romance where all of the cinematic elements fit together perfectly.
4 ||| Classic in the true sense with great theme music to boot.
4 ||| Few movies make you feel dirtier, and so perversely grateful for the pleasure.
4 ||| OK, the plot verges on absurdity - but who cares?
4 ||| The dialogue is stinging and the performances to be savoured in a haunting study of romantic obsession that deserves its return to the big screen.
4 ||| Laura is still every bit as gripping in 2012.
4 ||| Not only one of Preminger's greatest, but one of the great noirs.
4 ||| Preminger deals in facades, with how perception cheats us, right down to the ideal image of Laura as a portrait. (Cinmathque Annotations on Film)
4 ||| It's one of the smartest of all noirs, and thus among the most enticingly savage and dangerous.
4 ||| A masterly mix of expressionism and street realism, this ranks among the undisputed masterpieces of German silent cinema.
4 ||| Rounded off with haunting theme music and sharp black-and-white cinematography (which took home an Oscar), this is a positively top-notch film noir.
4 ||| Perhaps ahead of its time, certainly too ambitious for its budget and its era, Legend is nevertheless a fascinating film
1 ||| Dark and often scary '80s fantasy hasn't aged well.
0 ||| I don't want to remember any more about Legend than to make sure I include it in my ''worst films of 1986'' list and never rent it when it comes out as a video cassette.
4 ||| Fredric March gives a superb performance.
4 ||| Prime Bette Davis featuring a memorable shooting in the opening.
4 ||| The greatest actress that the cinema has ever had the honor to service is typically terrific.
4 ||| Simple story about big hearts. Potier is wonderful.
4 ||| There's not much dramatic urgency to the story, but that's perfectly fine: This is the sort of picture that gives wholesomeness a good name, and its life lessons are imparted in a leisurely and unforced manner.
4 ||| One of the most gentle and affecting stories about faith and generosity ever committed to film.
4 ||| A beautifully understated work, built on the dignity of Poitier's warm gravitas, and told with a gentle and disarmingly moving confidence.
4 ||| One of the joys which movies provide too rarely is the opportunity to see a literate script handled intelligently. The Lion in Winter triumphs at that difficult task...
4 ||| Peter O'TOole and Katharine Hepburn are superb as the bickering, yet loving Henry II and his meddling wife Eleanor of Aquitaine.
4 ||| While the script and the performances are simply dazzling, it is notable, too, for the screen debuts of Timothy Dalton and a combustible Anthony Hopkins.
4 ||| O'Toole holds his own with the magnificent Hepburn in a witty, literate, and inventive script.
4 ||| A commanding blend of the high and low, a thoroughly sordid family melodrama designed for over-literate history buffs.
4 ||| Plenty of swords and knives make appearances in The Lion in Winter, but none can possibly cut as deep as the caustic dialogue.
4 ||| One of Hollywood's great epics, a film often overlooked in favor of some of the era's flashier spectacles.
4 ||| It's a simple children's story, idealistic and dangerously close to cloying, but in the best tradition of Old Hollywood, it's a real treat.
4 ||| Charming tale of adolescent romance that had me mooning after Diane Lane for years.
4 ||| Charming to the max with great Olivier turn.
4 ||| An absolutely delightful teen romance.
4 ||| I have seen a lot of musicals (probably more than most people under the age of 50), and few are as lively and fun as Little Shop of Horrors.
4 ||| The movie doesn't labor its jokes or insist on its virtuoso special effects, but devotes its energies to seeming unforced and delightful.
4 ||| The film represents a rare example where Hollywood has applied itself rigorously to material that might somehow seem beneath it with wholly satisfying results.
4 ||| a classic black comedy musical
4 ||| A solid adaptation and crisp direction by Cukor.
4 ||| The film begins in a gentle fashion and slips away smoothly without any forced attempt to help the finish to linger in the minds of the audience.
4 ||| Released during the depths of the Depression, Little Women buoyed Americans' spirits. It still does.
4 ||| Star-graced Cukor production is classic.
1 ||| Lock this up in a vault and throw away the key.
4 ||| Kubrick made excellent film even in such circumstances, and today's audience may still enjoy it, which is another proof of its timeless quality.
4 ||| It has a kind of weird comic feel to it, with small chuckles coming out of scenes that are funny because of character, not situation.
4 ||| Brilliant and provocative.
4 ||| Classic Kubrick treatment of controversial best seller.
4 ||| A fascinating if problematic early film from Stanley Kubrick, perhaps the most obsessive of the great auteurs of the 1960s.
1 ||| An epically misbegotten, misguided adaptation...
4 ||| O'Neill's greatest play is brought to the screen with an overpowering wealth of talent: Hepburn, Richardson, and Robards give magnificent, once-in-a-lifetime performances as members of the doomed Tyrone family.
4 ||| By the end of this, you're part of the family. Welcome to hell.
4 ||| O'Neill's play transformed beautifully into Hepburn, Robards vehicle.
4 ||| An adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's legendary play results in a stage-bound production lifted by grand performances, including the delightful Katharine Hepburn.
4 ||| O belo roteiro, escrito a partir de histrias de William Faulkner, ganha ainda mais dimenso graas s performances de Newman, Woodward e Welles - alm,  claro, da direo segura de Martin Ritt e da tima fotografia.
4 ||| Director Martin Ritt and writers Harriet Frank, Jr. and Irving Ravetch opted for a less-than-faithful adaptation of the author's work, and the results were excellent.
1 ||| Though The Yard is a terrible picture, I'll admit to having unwillingly enjoyed some of the football practice and parts of the final game -- even though it's much too long.
4 ||| Part prison film, part football film, this violent but outstanding comedy-drama by gifted action director Robert Aldrich explores the brutality inherent in both the American penal system and football.
4 ||| The Best Actor Oscar that year went to Yul Brynner for his broad emoting in The King and I, but Douglas -- in one of the defining performances of his career -- would have been a far more deserving winner.
4 ||| It's an impeccable film -- a model of psychological suspense and a stunning display of Lang's power and skill.
4 ||| This astonishing movie represents an unsurpassed grand synthesis of storytelling.
4 ||| Fritz Lang's M is one of the great philosophical films, primarily because its anger and message are not bogged down in pretentious overtones with crush the story of the film, rendering it almost unwatchable a second time.
4 ||| Arguably Fritz Lang's greatest cinematic achievement, this unnerving tale of deranged child-killer Hans Beckert (Lorre) stalking the dingy alleys and shadowy playscapes of Berlin is as riveting a piece of filmmaking as you're ever likely to see.
4 ||| One of Lang's most impressive achievements
4 ||| Fritz Lang's first sound film, his most chilling and provocative work, features Peter Lorre's greatest performance as a child molester and murderer.
4 ||| [An] important film which rightly deserves its success.
4 ||| very likely the greatest film of one of cinema's greatest directors
4 ||| It's clear that Lang was ahead of most of his peers in grasping the promise of the motion picture form.
4 ||| Even after 75 years, Fritz Lang's first German talkie works beautifully as a carefully constructed thriller and police procedural.
4 ||| Peter Lorre's finest performance, and a truly significant socially-themed film.
4 ||| Fascinating early talkie that made Peter Lorre a star as child murderer hunted by all.
4 ||| M is responsible for some of the most memorable images and sequences in cinema history
4 ||| ...a touchstone, one of those classics that infects the popular imagination to the point that it's really not necessary for most people to have actually seen it to recognize its signal moments ...
4 ||| Fritz Lang's acute use of objects, symbols, letters, and codes to decrypt a relatively simple narrative remains as perfect an example of pure cinema in the sound era as one is likely to find.
4 ||| This is a movie that dares to sympathize with a sick person, that risks making the monster real and us (in an era when Germany's cinema was still shellacked in canted angles and fanciful shadows).
4 ||| Few films are gripping and effective 82 years after their original release, but this one surely is.
4 ||| It is a cousin to the early Hitchcock of The Lodger, and I have always found something even something faintly Ealingesque about its cynicism and satire.
4 ||| You'll never look at a novelty balloon in the same way again.
4 ||| Lang's razor-sharp dissection of crime and punishment never puts a foot wrong.
4 ||| Lang's movie is that rare thing, a nail-biting soul-searcher. While M steers clear of analyzing deviance, it is startling in its musings on which punishment fits an inhuman crime.
4 ||| Be afraid. Be properly afraid. The greatest creation of Fritz Lang's career remains one of the most disturbing movies of his, or any, film-making era.
0 ||| Incomprehensible.
4 ||| This film is stunning to look at, with wonderful sets, interesting costumes, and yet another work of gorgeous cinematography by Bergman fave, Sven Nykvist.
4 ||| An absolutely dazzling film entertainment, so full of beauty, intelligence, wit, and fun that it becomes a testimonial not only to man's possibilities but also to his high spirits.
4 ||| What Bergman does is to convey the actual magic of theater at its best.
4 ||| Ingmar Bergman has never before made a movie so warm, happy and innocent... It's as if all this joy has been building up inside him during the great decade of metaphysical films beginning with Persona.
4 ||| Welles's second great masterpiece.
4 ||| I can't help but be pulled in two directions. One is enthusiastically embracing the film for its beauty, poetry, brilliance, ingenuity, and greatness. The other is mourning the fact that the movie could yet have been still more.
4 ||| Ambersons - even in its mutilated form - has a resonance most movies can only dream of.
4 ||| A domestic drama that is every bit the equal of Welles' Citizen Kane.
4 ||| Orson Welles' heavily chopped up drama, it is still a nostalgic, dramatically powerful tale and should ultimately be savored for what it is rather than rejected for what it is not.
4 ||| Although reams have been written about the mutilation of Orson Welles' second feature, what remains of it is nevertheless a major accomplishment.
4 ||| The bold cinematic techniques Welles employed in Citizen Kane are put to even more sophisticated use here.
4 ||| one of Hollywood's great tragedies both on-screen and off
4 ||| A haunting and rueful examination of a changing way of life and the fortunes (and failures) of those with limited vision.
4 ||| Film snobs like to say that this, the second feature from Orson Welles, is even better than Citizen Kane. That's a stretch, but it's certainly exquisitely beautiful film-making - there are frames in there to die for.
4 ||| Welles has a knack for heart-rending stories rife with comeuppance, tragedy, remembrance, doomed romance, and, most superbly, the pleasures of forgiveness and closure.
4 ||| The theme music is perfect. It's a rousing score that will stick in your head.
4 ||| a rousing adventure story that not only includes a brilliant cast, but explores some of the deeper contradictions of the mythic noble outlaw
4 ||| Simply one of the most entertaining Westerns ever made.
4 ||| If it's not the greatest Western ever made, it's certainly in the top three. This is the movie that made Steve McQueen a star.
4 ||| A classic western, a stellar cast.
4 ||| If you're going to rip someone off, may as well rip off the best
4 ||| Director John Sturges was extremely fortunate in securing a near-perfect cast for this enduringly popular western reworking of Japanese classic Seven Samurai.
4 ||| A touch of romance, a bit of humor, plenty of suspense, and Bernstein's theme music at all the right spots.
4 ||| It's the stuff that dreams are made of.
4 ||| The perfect movie experience.
4 ||| Gets my vote for the greatest piece of American film noir, simply because everything about it is so flawless.
4 ||| A seminal moment in the development of what would come to be known as film noir.
4 ||| Among the movies we not only love but treasure, The Maltese Falcon stands as a great divide.
4 ||| A true masterpiece.
4 ||| One of the most interesting aspects of this classic movie is the way that Sam Spade thinks though the moral dilemmas.
4 ||| The definitive Sam Spade portrayal.
4 ||| Sam Spade é o personagem definitivo de Bogart: cínico, arrogante, frio e cruel, Spade possui todas as características do típico herói dos filmes noir.
4 ||| Now that's some tasty classic noir.
4 ||| John Huston's debut is still primo noir.
4 ||| Best in noir - Best in Bogie - One of the best ever.
4 ||| Bogart became Bogart in John Huston's great first film, a trend-setting, brilliantly cast adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's hardboiled novel ... This was the stuff that dreams -- and Hollywood -- was made of.
4 ||| If 'The Maltese Falcon' doesn't qualify as the best private-eye yarn ever filmed, I don't know what does.
4 ||| ... part of what makes a film great is its power to obliterate whatever preconceptions we bring to it. There is brittle wit and sparkling harm and a very adult sense of fun present in The Maltese Falcon; it still works as a movie
4 ||| With its dark, complex plotting, stark black-and-white photography, concentration on the baseness of man, and a cynical mood sustained to its still shockingly grim conclusion, this is the prototypical film noir.
4 ||| Perfect use of the old McGuffin.
4 ||| The Maltese Falcon is among the most important and influential movies to emerge from the Hollywood system -- as significant in some ways as its contemporary, Citizen Kane.
4 ||| Excellent but too mature for the littlest kids.
4 ||| "The stuff that dreams are made of," comments Spade about the elusive black bird of the title, a sentiment easily applied to this indisputable masterpiece.
4 ||| Arguably the best detective movie ever made in Hollywood.
4 ||| The Maltese Falcon feels evergreen, not so much in style or attitude but in mood.
4 ||| It is a film that somehow started Film Noir and yet was also its peak. It is a film that should be beloved by all, not just Film Studies tutors.
4 ||| There's two competing frames of reference throughout: the narrative itself, then a meta-narrative with the characters continually voicing the etiquette of their genre scenario
4 ||| It's a nonstop verbal joust between each of the severe, slippery characters, all of whom wear unyielding masks to conceal intentions.
4 ||| Grandiose storytelling with peerless performances. Why couldn't Fred Zinneman direct every historical drama in the '60s?
4 ||| Outstanding adaptation of Robert Bolt's play detailing battle between Sir Thomas More and King Henry VIII
4 ||| A film for all seasons.
4 ||| One man's conviction against the tyranny of Henry VIII makes for an intriguing drama in A Man for All Seasons
4 ||| Zinnemann proved to be a filmmaker for all seasons.
4 ||| Superb movie of More's stand against Henry VIII.
4 ||| The notion that politics and religion make the worst bedfellows has never gone out of fashion -- the current pack of right-wing hyenas in Congress attest to that -- and this drama offers a peek at this oil-and-vinegar mix from a historical perspective.
4 ||| Not a moment of The Manchurian Candidate lacks edge and tension and a cynical spin.
4 ||| A brilliantly realized, acidic satire of American political life. It takes us into a strange, hallucinatory world that is hard to shake, long after the movie is over.
4 ||| the film still feels taut, scathing, and paranoid because it cuts to the heart of mass fears and how those fears, whatever they may be, can be manipulated and exploited by the powerful-something that is no different today than it was in 1962.
4 ||| Possibly John Frankenheimer's finest film.
4 ||| It's one of the best movie-movies I've ever seen.
4 ||| Um filme tenso e inteligente que traz Frank Sinatra em grande atuação.
4 ||| Cold War thriller still packs a punch 40 years later.
4 ||| Angela Lansbury [is] the most effective actor among a troupe of memorable roles.
4 ||| A nerve-beating masterpiece, and more timely now than then.
4 ||| With a dour, uncompromising view of humanity punctuated by raw violence, The Manchurian Candidate feels post-Kennedy, or like a harbinger of Watergate-era splatter
4 ||| It's heady stuff in a nail-biting chiller that still has the power to make viewers perspire profusely.
4 ||| It's both exciting and disheartening that a 42 year-old satire like this still works as pointedly as it does.
4 ||| A volatile work, part thriller, part quasi-science fiction, part vicious satire.
4 ||| People have called The Machurian Candidate the greatest political thriller ever made. People would be right.
4 ||| ...goes down the rabbit hole, though never too far to lose its satirical relevance to the insanity of real-world politics.
4 ||| a benchmark of the United States' coming of age in the 1960s
4 ||| With spry editing and camerawork, [Frankenheimer] fuses together a documentary-like realism and more expressive stylizations to create a hybrid thriller-satire
4 ||| Set the standard for cinematic paranoid thrillers and stands as the quintessential John Frankenheimer film. [Blu-ray]
4 ||| Classic Cold War satirical thriller stands test of time.
4 ||| ... what strikes me is the savvy and modern craft of its filmmaking.
4 ||| One of the most successful adaptations from a novel to the big screen, capably translating the paranoia and suspense Condon imparted to his literary readership.
4 ||| A clever, funny and very skillful thriller about how the kid builds his own atomic bomb.
4 ||| The Manhattan Project remains a clever time capsule of 80s nuclear commentary and a timeless, endlessly watchable thriller.
4 ||| Michael Mann unnerves his viewers with this psychologically slippery, contemplative and disturbing thriller.
4 ||| Lean serial-killer thriller makes The Silence of the Lambs look sheepish.
4 ||| Its Miami Vice sheen hides one of the most effective thrillers in recent memory; a dramatically different counterpunch to the better-known Silence of the Lambs.
4 ||| A slick and glossy thriller that still stands out.
0 ||| One of the worst movies ever made. How do people think this is effective? It's so schmaltzy and sloppy and careless. No tension, no terror, and Hannibal does not put his feet up!
4 ||| A grim, stylish thriller.
4 ||| Unlike Hannibal, [Mann is] able to balance style and substance with a late-night hearse pace.
4 ||| Eminently worthy and stylish.
4 ||| Cox's Hannibal is a masterclass in moderation.
4 ||| Innovatively shot by ace cinematographer Dante Spinotti, this contains at least two bravura sequences that still stand out.
4 ||| Mann's visual aesthetic combined with the source material of Harris is a slick and tense package with its own unique boatload of frights.
0 ||| Unbelievably bad.
1 ||| One of the stupidest movies ever conceived... its very off-the-wall shoddiness is astounding.
0 ||| This movie is a real curiosity. It's dead. I don't mean it's bad. A lot of bad movies are fairly throbbing with life. Mannequin is dead. The wake lasts 1 1/2 hours, and then we can leave the theater.
1 ||| Both lead performers are affable. It's the material that sinks them.
1 ||| A pallid shopfloor fairytale with absolutely no magic to speak of.
1 ||| There`s some solid talent here, but Gottlieb's overemphatic direction reduces them all to broad caricature -- the kind of crazed mugging that isn't often seen outside the boundaries of Saturday morning kiddie shows.
1 ||| A lifeless and sophomoric attempt at romantic comedy that draws on the fantasy films of old Hollywood but fails miserably.
4 ||| It's exciting, thrilling, romantic, and thoroughly entertaining.. And it's all anchored by a rousing performance from Douglas Fairbanks. This is what going to the movies should be about: Pure escapism!
4 ||| A compelling and thoughtful film, its strong performances by Borgnine and Blair alone would make it a must see.
4 ||| Marty is one of those straightforward, no-frills films that shoots directly to the dead-true point.
1 ||| ...a meandering, relentlessly unwatchable piece of work.
1 ||| A grab-the-money-and-run disaster opus with a slumming Connery and Wood ludicrious as a Russian scientist. Too bad the set wasn't hit by a giant falling space rock.
1 ||| If you're ever asked just how bad the disaster movie could get, this is the answer.
1 ||| An $18 million, star-studded disaster film, which in itself is a major disaster.
1 ||| "Hey, maybe if we show Chuck Norris killing a lot of evil Asians, we can make people forget about that whole Vietnam thing..."
1 ||| Boring statement about the human condition. DeNiro's a bad guy. Deal with it. And missions are barbaric. Get over it.
1 ||| Bottom of the barrel Bond
1 ||| Possibly the worst Bond film.
1 ||| Another buffoon 007 by Moore
1 ||| James Bond would have to go back to Earth in "For Your Eyes Only" because "Moonraker" is truly a stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf herder.
1 ||| Unquestionably the nadir to the whole Bond series.
1 ||| it is a lousy movie and Hepburn's performance, after some strikingly enigmatic opening moments, is embarrassingly bad.
1 ||| One of the most obnoxious musicals ever to be staged for movie cameras.
1 ||| It's very plastic satire, grounded not in real life or genuine observation but in easy, tired ideas of suburban life.
1 ||| Gere and Basinger fizzle rather than sizzle in this lame Bayou thriller.
1 ||| Not even the goings-on between Gere and Basinger and the horrific happenings in the exotic bayou settings can rev up this romantic thriller.
1 ||| one remake the world is probably better off without
0 ||| I reeeeeaaaaaaalllllllyyyyyy hated this movie...
0 ||| Why do people go to these movies?
1 ||| You'll just have to enjoy the scenes of Curtis disco-dancing and wonderful moments such as when the severed head of a victim rolls across the dance floor.
1 ||| Unusually incompetent from start to finish...
0 ||| It's Mitt Romney in blue jeans, this Promised Land, and we've all had enough of that.
1 ||| Just as underhanded as the soulless corporations it's taking to task.
1 ||| Promised Land can say whatever it wants about fracking and the environment and big corporate business. What really bothers me about the movie is that it stinks.
1 ||| Van Sant is no Frank Capra, so why is he trying so hard to be?
0 ||| Prophecy fails so miserably that it reaches depths generally reserved for William Shatner records and Nora Ephron screenplays. Watch it with a friend.
1 ||| Mother Nature strikes back - but it's mostly boring, then silly, instead of gory and tense.
1 ||| Yes, all of our DVD collections can now be complete with the addition of one of the '80s lamest, blandest, and most TV-movie-ish flicks ever made: Pulse.
1 ||| Typical Ah-nold shoot 'em up.
0 ||| So bad it's painful. If there wasn't a "Terminator," there would be no "Ahnuld."
0 ||| Red-baiting pablum about some Brat Packers, here dubbed the Wolverines, who rescue Colorado from a Soviet occupation. Risibly bad, jingoistic, and often laughable to boot.
1 ||| This thing was a dud in the 80s. That's saying something.
0 ||| Incredibly stupid
0 ||| Horrible spawn of the mediocre Conan the Barbarian.
1 ||| Hilariously awful
0 ||| Unwatchably bad sword-and-sorcery nonsense.
1 ||| It's a truly horrible concoction, filled with stiff, overly serious dialogue, wretched performances, bad lighting and a lazy score by the otherwise great Ennio Morricone.
1 ||| Sure, there are a few funny moments here and there with several obviously intended jokes, but director Richard Fleischer never milks the elements of self-parody for what they're worth.
1 ||| None of this would matter if Red Sonja was the least bit exciting, or sexy, or even funny. Instead, it`s lumbering, oddly prim and laughable.
1 ||| Director Walter Murch tries to infuse the story with the inventiveness and adventure of the Star Wars saga, but the results are disappointing.
1 ||| I'm seeking it for making me sit through this whole thing
0 ||| Positively one of the worst movies ever made, though Stowe is, as always, luminously lovely.
0 ||| Though it doesn't say so anywhere in the film, Road House must be set on another planet where the inhabitants resemble humans. This can't be the world I live in.
1 ||| I hated this movie as a teen. Haven't seen it since.
1 ||| Road House tries so hard to be macho that it becomes a parody of itself.
1 ||| All Road House amounts to is a botched southern, and it's not worth a detour.
1 ||| It's pointless, mean-spiritede, excessively violent and, perhaps worst of all, just plain dumb.
0 ||| The nadir in the history of Disney animation. Simply a disgrace.
1 ||| One of the worst animated films ever produced by Disney...
1 ||| The tagline says that they called it love and it was for sale, to which the appropriate response is that one hopes they kept the receipt.
1 ||| Takes itself way too seriously.
1 ||| Crystal and Hines don't have great chemistry, nor do they have a complementary repartee.
1 ||| The film is awkward and, at its worst, listless and meandering.
1 ||| Cronenberg's obsession with making the human insides visible begins here.
1 ||| The film has nowhere to go except to give us a predictable initial confrontation between Guttenberg and Sheedy over military weapons.
1 ||| As slasher films go, this is about average. The sets are cheap, with most of the budget seemingly going to the gore effects.
1 ||| Witless even by slasher-film standards.
1 ||| It's a lousy movie, the kind where camp does not manage to equal fun.
1 ||| A movie in which leering and beer-drinking are everybody's favorite pursuits.
1 ||| It doesn't know that girls are people, too.
1 ||| Another worthless sex comedy.
0 ||| By the time the "world famous" wet t-shirt contest arrives, the movie has already unfurled nearly an hour of boredom.
1 ||| The Squeeze is a non-movie held together only by the intrinsic appeal of Michael Keaton and Rae Dawn Chong, its stars. They are given nothing to work with here. Nothing.
1 ||| Seriously, strangely and curiously BAD comedy. Keaton's really been through some stinkers, but few as dire as this one.
1 ||| The Squeeze is the kind of insufferably dull and derivative self-styled "comedy caper" doomed to play for about a week in movie theaters and then be instantly relegated to in-flight limbo.
0 ||| Dullsville
0 ||| Why?
1 ||| Barbara Streisand. Is. A Star Is Born. And two-shots have never been so completely arbitrary.
1 ||| Too often director Frank Pierson appears to be allowing his players to act the scene as they think fit rather than under his guidance.
0 ||| A sorry excuse for a straight-to-video movie, even by the standards of the rest of the sequels.
0 ||| A comedy so listless, leisurely and unspirited that it was an act of the will for me to care about it, even while I was watching it.
1 ||| Mr. Harmon has an easygoing attractiveness, but neither he nor anyone else seems comfortable with the film's antic pace. And for all its busyness, this comedy has no real focus, ricocheting from character to character with wearying abandon.
1 ||| Another failure in Harmon's attempt to move from TV to the big screen.
1 ||| ...a crudely calibrated series of 'thrills,' each timed for maximum sustained interest.
0 ||| Laughing at this stuff isn't good for the soul.
0 ||| about as erotic as a Shirley Temple musical
1 ||| not even funny as modern irony
1 ||| This cinematic atrocity truly is one of the all-time worsts.
1 ||| Silliness abounds, so much so that the picture comes off closer to a comedy than the romantic action-adventure it was meant to be.
1 ||| Truly forgettable, except for Bo's booty
0 ||| Painfully dull.
0 ||| The movie is an ambitious experiment, but a long and tedious one, and our revels end long before Mazursky's.
1 ||| The film is so tackily written and directed, so darkly photographed and the sound so dimly recorded, that it's difficult to stay with it.
1 ||| ...an absolutely interminable piece of work...
1 ||| I never got into this. Very slow, dated special effects, and obvious exploration of the paranoia theme.
1 ||| All great farces need a certain insane focus, an intensity that declares how important they are to themselves. This movie is too confident, too relaxed, too clever to be really funny.
1 ||| It's the laziness of the project that's finally most galling.
1 ||| The concept is a funny one, yet no one seems to have the faintest idea of what to do with it.
0 ||| Cameron Mitchell, playing the masked psycho, delivers one of the most obnoxious performances ever in a horror movie...
1 ||| These images more closely resemble a bad dream following an overdose of pepperoni-and-onion pizza than the result of ingesting hallucinogenic drugs.
1 ||| Like many comedies attempting to exist in the real world, the numerous predicaments are far too severe to be approached with even a touch of sincerity.
0 ||| Ugh! Ick! Gag me with a spoon! This film is an embarrasment.
1 ||| A bad joke shoddily disguised as a gritty urban thriller. Didn't any of these guys have subway tokens?
1 ||| Boring fish out of water story. No laugh out loud moments.
1 ||| It's great, if you're 13, and living in the 80s, and have a crush on Kelly Le Brock.
1 ||| Watching Weird Science again in the harsh light of my 20s was like catching up with an old friend who I had recalled as a raucous party animal, but was now clearly a shaky meth addict with no teeth.
0 ||| An offence to the Amish
1 ||| Forget it, Jake: It AIN'T 'Chinatown'
0 ||| At one point the (pig) swallows a mobile phone -- why couldn't it have eaten the movie's master print?
1 ||| Well-intentioned hunk of trash.
1 ||| Well intentioned but failed attempt at morality story about homelessness
1 ||| Of the many threats to modern man documented in horror films -- the slashers, the haunters, the body snatchers -- the most innocent would seem to be the druids.
0 ||| Absolutely hysterical. Unfortunately, it's supposed to be scary
1 ||| Friedkin here seems strangely determined to squander his talent; lots of wasted opportunities.
1 ||| Even the characters in the movie don't know what's going on.
0 ||| star-spangled silliness, and one of the biggest debacles of the 1980s
1 ||| Either as unintentional parody or truncated epic, you can start this Revolution without me.
1 ||| Mixed in with the film's graphic action sequences -- which are as beautifully shot as they are unwatchable -- are a lot of feverish, feeble, inch-deep platitudes about freedom and justice.
0 ||| Savagely unfunny and unbelievably stupid.
1 ||| Lame and tedious comic book film. Try THE SHADOW or THE ROCKETEER instead.
1 ||| Should have stayed in the funny pages.
1 ||| A disappointment on every count.
1 ||| Ohmigod. Bad. Ohmigod. Bad. Ohmigod. Bad.
1 ||| The film where we began to suspect that Charlie Sheen might not be as cool as we thought.
1 ||| To be honest, I just don't know how your kids will react to this film; you, however, might want to bring something to read.
1 ||| It's always a bad sign when the core audience of a film -- children -- are either walking out early or are half-asleep when the credits roll at the end of a film.
1 ||| In a season like this, what's one dog more or less?
1 ||| Kevin Lima directs with as heavy a hand as Stephen Herek did the last time around -- and with a script even more contrived.
0 ||| It's hard to imagine kids paying more than lukewarm attention to this drone of a movie.
1 ||| A film without mirth or magic.
1 ||| hopkins cringing at rourke is absurd!
1 ||| Ghost is a movie about corporate malfeasance and greed, aided by bloody awful early CGI and predicting the basic flippancy of Forrest Gump and American Beauty.
1 ||| Fails miserably to join the ranks of buddy cop classics like Lethal Weapon and 48 hours.
1 ||| Boring adaptation with no scares, no mood and no sex appeal (considering it's a form of sexual persecution)
0 ||| Supposedly whimsical fantasy by Woody Allen feels forced and underdeveloped. Great performances by Joe Mantegna and Mia Farrow are lost in Allen's bizarre dream world.
1 ||| Perhaps if you have a special interest in foul folks and morbidities, you will thrill to this Hal Wallis picture. Frankly, we squirmed -- and not from dread.
1 ||| The painstakingly obvious screenplay by Kevin Wade (Working Girl) plays like an eighth-grade civics primer: ethics and morality are good, greed and corruption are bad.
1 ||| The Field is a grim allegory of hard life on the land -- a symbolic play, transplanted uneasily to the greater realism of the film medium, where what we might accept on the stage now looks contrived and artificial.
1 ||| This is why Stallone gave up on comedy.
1 ||| Toy Soldiers, a film with earnest performances and professional production values, is constructed out of characters, situations and gimmicks that will be instantly recognized by the weary viewer. There is nothing new here.
1 ||| One of Chuck's more generic efforts.
1 ||| The problem with Deceived, and its rather hobblingly bland title, is not so much Hawn as a premise which doesn't quite know how to utilize its potential.
1 ||| Nearly washed-up Davis essaying completely washed-up Davis.
0 ||| Repellent in a way few films ever have been
1 ||| If I wanted to watch a bunch of pointless brutality, I'd go turn on the news.
1 ||| Dreadful coming of age movie about kids and death. Kudos for the effort, but it's just depressing.
1 ||| Will Steve Martin EVER be funny in a movie again?
1 ||| Minor fluff. Not recommended.
1 ||| For all its glad-handing of cheer and all-encompassing warmth, has a heart as tiny and cold and calculated as a Grinch's.
1 ||| Connery & Bracco run through the jungle. Yawn.
1 ||| One of the weakest 'Indiana Jones' rip-offs to date.
1 ||| Embarrassing for Connery
1 ||| Aside from being superficially written, aside from being shot with little sense of time or place, the movie portrays Babe Ruth as a man almost completely lacking in the ability to have, or to provide, happiness.
1 ||| A terrible bio-pic, almost as bad as William Bendix in The Babe Ruth Story; Goodman is all ham; inaccuracies abound; no real sense of the game is evident.
1 ||| Everyone except Sweeney and Kelly is excruciatingly bad, small wonder spouting lines that crash like lead pucks on to the ice.
1 ||| I prefer the remake.
0 ||| All I want for Christmas is to never see All I Want for Christmas again.
0 ||| ...is a break from trash like this. Just awful!
1 ||| A witless, sexist, offensive mishmash that is surprisingly inept, considering all the high-power talent involved.
0 ||| It's not even funny. Nor does it contain half the wit or charm as the old Doris Day sex comedies it so resembles. In fact, it's downright mean-spirited toward women, as is Murphy's wont.
1 ||| As for the movie, the makers of Casablanca can sleep peacefully. Come to think of it, so can the makers of Ernest Scared Stupid.
1 ||| The movie is shameless in exploiting the father-son connection to try to make the star, who exudes a bored, dead-eyed cool, seem sympathetic.
0 ||| Man, the Bond films came just in time to rescue Brosnan from swill like this.
1 ||| Com sua cena de sexo cafona, seus dilogos patticos, seus efeitos trash e seu roteiro absurdo, quase acaba servindo como diverso involuntria. Quase.
0 ||| Hilariously bad horror show
1 ||| A surprisingly incompetent film.
0 ||| Mommy! Mommy! Make the bad man stop!
1 ||| A huge disappointment.
1 ||| Both the live and animated characters are equally uninteresting.
1 ||| Critics often use the word 'incomprehensible' when referring to a poorly constructed movie, but nowhere is this assessment more accurate than in the case of Cool World.
1 ||| nice animation & design but - shudder
1 ||| Hopeless.
1 ||| The doodles are thoroughly repulsive and, worse, unfunny.
1 ||| A few of Bakshi`s inventions, such as a rattled telephone that panics every time it rings, are amusing and well animated, but most of the characters are grating and dislikable.
1 ||| The movie has no internal logic. It's a mess.
1 ||| Much ballyhooed, much-advertised, the live-action/animation feature is much disaster. Not even an animated Kim Basinger dancing the hoochie-coochie can save it from its own death-wish combination of outsized ambition and undersized budget.
1 ||| Conquest, no; a lot of Space, yes
1 ||| Filmmaker Michael Mann kicks of The Last of the Mohicans with a muddled and mostly baffling opening stretch...
1 ||| a debacle
1 ||| Curiously though, as it so often does, the rare convergence of everything gone wrong makes for pretty compulsive viewing.
0 ||| I actually walked out of this one...bad!
1 ||| The first movie was existential in its merciless unfolding. This one turns into a slasher movie with a cheap joke at the end.
1 ||| The original was horrifying.
0 ||| An exploitative thriller that also harbors dangerous notions about and readily trivializes child neglect, sexual abuse and rape.
1 ||| This film stinks worse than a big fat pile of dated limburgher.
0 ||| The story not only relies on the complete and unalterable stupidity of every character in the movie, but on the gullibility of those who watch it.
1 ||| Yeah, Alicia Silverstone's a fetching little Lolita. But there's no excuse for this depressing 'Play Misty for Me' in spandex.
1 ||| The Crush would be an entirely worthless and painfully familiar little thriller even without its creepy devotion to the sexiness of youth.
1 ||| The Crush is the movie that child abusers have been waiting for.
1 ||| Promoted like an action movie, but there's one problem -- this movie has no action!
0 ||| So slow-moving and lacking in excitement that it's torture to sit through.
1 ||| bah. rent the French original
1 ||| This is supposed to be snappy material, and it comes across gloomy.
1 ||| In this pointless remake, essaying the Judy Holliday Oscar-winning role, Melanie Griffith gives a poor performance, marked by monotonous delivery and tiresome semi-spunky routines.
1 ||| Western as vanity project
0 ||| About the least funny comedy ever created.
1 ||| Take away the mountains and what you have is a howlingly bad action film with a cornball villain out to steal a massive amount of United States currency from federal agents.
1 ||| The fact that this was a hit proves, once again, that the average IQ is only 100.
1 ||| Is this a thriller? You've never scene a 'suspense film' drag its heels so deplorably, enlivened only by some colorful character acting.
1 ||| Though socially-minded in its concern for the moral decay of urban society, Equinox suffers from the usual Rudolph problems, low-key tone and incoherent text, made worse by Matthew Modine flat performance in a dual role.
0 ||| When so few brain cells have been shed during the making of a movie, it seems foolish for others to expend more than their share figuring things out after the fact.
1 ||| Either Calendar Girl is a blatant attempt to showcase Jason Priestley (of Beverly Hills 90210 fame), or it's an undertaking to make a big-screen copy of the popular 70s sitcom Happy Days.
1 ||| As good as any movie can be with Jason Priestley in the lead.
1 ||| Unfunny, unconvincing nostalgia trip
0 ||| Poor teen period piece. Not enough Marilyn Monroe, and a god-awful chase subplot.
1 ||| Can't we just agree to let Marilyn Monroe rest in peace?
1 ||| On film, the story's charm fades fast.
1 ||| Unpersuasive and shallow.
1 ||| Most of the screentime goes to Michael Biehn, who brings all the gravitas of Mr. Bean to his hardboiled con man role. As far as Cage goes over the top, Biehn goes just as far under the bottom.
1 ||| All in all, AIrborne is not bad for what it is, but what it is is very little.
1 ||| Fad flick that has lots of skateboards ... and literally nothing else.
1 ||| Predictable teen-slush.
1 ||| Dismal: Stick with the Disney version instead
1 ||| The Flop that tried
1 ||| At its best, Gunmen is a pale imitation of other, better films. At its worst, it's instantly forgettable.
1 ||| Standard actioner with a "what were they thinking?" acting ensemble.
1 ||| [A] witless action movie.
0 ||| Truly awful, though I'll never get tired of Patrick Stewart a'slummin'.
1 ||| Dreary drivel from Madonna's "arty" phase
1 ||| More dreadful than dangerous.
1 ||| ...an uncommonly interminable experience.
1 ||| The Getaway is a particularly nasty and mean-spirited action picture, with the dramatic depth of an arcade game.
1 ||| What Oliver Stone has created is his Mrs. Miniver for the Vietnam era.
1 ||| The film is for very young children and people in comas.
1 ||| A huge disappointment from Don Bluth.
1 ||| It's hard to maintain the proper mood when your 'bad-***' heroines inspire fits of giggles.
1 ||| Boring Western. Could be empowering, but it's not.
1 ||| Frankly, if this flick is somebody's idea of "pro-woman," my guess is that that certain "somebody" probably doesn't know all that many women.
1 ||| The worthwhile cast can't overcome bland storytelling and uninspired scripting.
1 ||| Gimmicky, tiresome, and without any redeeming qualities. Diaz is nothing more than a pretty, smiling face.
1 ||| No one involved seemed to have anything interesting to say or present visually.
1 ||| Stinks.
1 ||| chaotic and dull
1 ||| For the most part, the film is simply boring.
1 ||| It Could Happen to You is so busy being nice that it forgets to be interesting, resulting in a watery, flavorless little love story with a good heart.
1 ||| Sour is not the word for it. The milk obtained from this money is positively rancid.
1 ||| I don't want to spoil it for you, but let's just say the gangster doesn't get what he wants, and true love saves the day.
1 ||| Not bad enough that it's witless and bland, but what a waste of Ed Harris!
0 ||| I can hear the pitch for this one: 'a sex comedy for the whole family.'
1 ||| This execrable film sinks ever lower as its dirty joke of a plot unfolds.
1 ||| A work so rancid and alienating you can only suppose it was planned as a tax loss.
1 ||| It's pointless to blame the cast members, who at least are in there trying.
1 ||| An embarrassing, preposterous mess.
1 ||| There's no redeeming this movie, possibly the worst idea Hollywood has conceived in a decade.
1 ||| What results is, at best, only a sparingly funny series of mistaken identities and some really distasteful hooker gags delivered by the shocked townsfolk.
1 ||| The latest film from director Richard Benjamin is a sour little attempt at heartwarming comedy that blithely relies on that most questionable and discomforting film convention -- the prostitute with a heart of gold.
1 ||| Too schmaltzy by half, and Downey and Tomei just never click.
1 ||| One of those movies that evaporates from memory the moment you leave the theater.
1 ||| Llosa relies on stock action shots and tedious exposition to get from scene to scene. You keep waiting for something -- anything -- neat to happen, but nothing does.
1 ||| This film perhaps didn't deserve its horrible reputation, but very few people should have to endure watching The Specialist just in order to come to such conclusion.
0 ||| A bizarre mix of explosions, histrionic acting and ridiculous plotting ... and it isn't pretty.
1 ||| A totally dull story that thinks it can use various explosions to make it interesting, The Specialist is about as exciting as an episode of Dragnet, and about as well acted.
0 ||| Ponderous, pretentious and acted with astounding indifference, The Specialist is a big fat bore with a couple of nice explosions. It's too somber to work as camp, and too tedious to work as anything else.
1 ||| A truly terrible moment in action cinema
1 ||| Tedious. Ludicrous. Completely unecessary. And I mean the whole movie, not just Stone and Stallone's naked shower scene.
1 ||| Rent the animated film instead.
1 ||| [Emma Thompson] is totally wasted in this movie.
0 ||| A pregnant Schwarznegger? Whose brainchild was this? A repugnantly lame and unfunny comedy.
0 ||| To quote Last Action Hero: "Big mistake!"
1 ||| Bizarre, surreal, and ultimately less engaging than playing Pong with a blind man...
0 ||| OOOF!!!!!
1 ||| The film is based on the popular video game and plays as a pathetically incoherent attempt to accommodate all the characters kids want to see come to life on the big screen.
1 ||| There's very little to get excited about in this laughably bad action adventure.
0 ||| With Van Damme giving one of his most wooden performances, and de Souza failing to capitalize on his graceful fight moves, Street Fighter adds up to the worst of a bad crop of Christmas movies, a picture only an arcade junkie could cheer.
0 ||| While de Souza's arrested development makes him a likely suspect to adapt a video game for movies, the result (like The Super Mario Brothers movie before it) is an empty exercise in hyper-stimulation. Or, to put it bluntly, a complete waste of time.
1 ||| It's too bad that the late Raul Julia had to finish his career with this dreck.
1 ||| Offensive and annoying.
1 ||| Raul Julia... is the reason that this is a memorable triumph of campy, kitschy, ironically lovable cinema, and not just an unlikable, boring farrago of an action movie.
1 ||| I'm not surprised that in my youth I thought Shallow Grave was a pretty cool movie. What surprises me now is that the adults at the time gave this ridiculous movie a pass.
1 ||| An almost astonishingly interminable thriller...
1 ||| Sea of Love with a black guy. Nothing new or interesting here.
1 ||| Appropriate title. Don't invite this film into your home.
0 ||| Despite the title, little, if anything, in this film rings true.
1 ||| Why, exactly, would you want to make a movie about racist hate groups, and then disguise it as family entertainment about a cute dog?
1 ||| Dog you say?
1 ||| ...as if you need to be warned away from a movie starring Chevy Chase and Jon Thomas.
1 ||| Pretty weak little family comedy...doesn't hurt but doesn't help.
1 ||| Brain-damaged adaptation of a book that wasn't all that brilliant to begin with.
1 ||| "a bomb that's sure to send you running for cover"
1 ||| Bad horror almost saved due to Silverstone's 'hotness' factor.
1 ||| This film is devoid of any real tension or thrills.
1 ||| Carpenter can't cloak the hilarity of this hoary horror tale.
1 ||| Horribly, horribly bad. Avoid.
1 ||| A trip to a village of the darned tedious.
1 ||| Carpenter's updating of the classic 1960 chiller is mediocre at best, and at times plummets into unintentional humor.
0 ||| abysmal and an embarrassment for everyone concerned
1 ||| It's terrifying to think a studio would make such nonsense. Possible retitling? 'the Death of Luke Skywalker'?
1 ||| John Carpenter's return to horror fizzles.
1 ||| The real shock came when I noticed that a woman filing out of the premiere screening beside me had actually marked her rating card with an "excellent" grade.
1 ||| Almost dreadful enough to spark reassessment of Brooke Shields in Endless Love.
1 ||| Nice to look at, the film's glum Miami Vice plot is subverted by the jiggy flavour of a film that's nothing more than an excuse for Martin Lawrence and Will Smith to play cops and robbers for two hours.
1 ||| Plays less like the gritty action-comedy picture it aspires to be and more like a disingenuous 126 minutes of slick Hollywood inanities, a cobbled-together series of flashy explosions and none-too-witty banter.
1 ||| Bad Boys is an amazingly boring action film, and will be funny only to fans of Martin Lawrence and/or Will Smith.
1 ||| One of the worst animated films in Disney history, you'll get more genuine history out of a pop-up book
0 ||| Horrible. Racist. An affront.
0 ||| Howlingly bad -- so awful, in fact, that it can actually be enjoyed on a certain level.
1 ||| A 90-minute wet T-shirt contest with interludes of extreme violence and soft-core porn.
0 ||| One of the most ridiculous action-thrillers of the year.
1 ||| Cindy Crawford is the best thing, and ultimately the worst thing, about this pitiful action thriller.
1 ||| The lamest model-turned-actress movie since Lauren Hutton co-starred with Evel Knievel in the misbegotten Viva Knievel!
1 ||| Cindy Crawford, meet Action Movie. Action Movie, meet Box Office Death.
0 ||| Dreary, murky, and senseless.
0 ||| Cindy Crawford can act; Joel Silver told us so, and he wouldn't lie to us...
1 ||| This catastrophic conglomeration of Puritanical repression and modern sensibilities squanders terrific acting talent and sumptuous production values, not to mention a darn good story.
1 ||| Pitiful loose interpretation of the Nathaniel Hawthorne novel of adultery and its implications.
1 ||| With Demi Moore and Gary Oldman as those 17th century adulterers Hester Prynne and the Rev. Dimmesdale, the movie has its silly moments, but more impressively, it is turgid, the second most prevalent trait of Joffe's films, and long, the third.
1 ||| The script by Douglas Day Stewart gives new meaning to the phrase "free adaptation".
1 ||| Love the book or hate it, but no novel deserves the shabby treatment that director Roland Joff and screenwriter Douglas Day Stewart have given the classic novel.
0 ||| A hysterically incompetent camp classic, highly recommended for English department faculty parties.
1 ||| If you've read the book you won't know the ending. Let's just say that Indians with flaming arrows come to the rescue. They manage to keep a straight face, which is more than anyone in the audience will be able to do.
1 ||| For anyone who's ever wondered why Hawthorne left out the mute servants, red cockatoos, and rolls in the proverbial hay. As Hawthorne himself would say: "Ignominious!"
0 ||| Oh, Roland Joff, thy free adaptation of the Hawthorne classic didst produce abudant derisive laughter. Didst thou once direct 'The Killing Fields?'
1 ||| Slaughter, sin, and sex in classic-turned-movie misfire.
0 ||| Loses its initial kick and verve and settles down into one long whine.
1 ||| Whew! Sitting through 112 minutes of Persuasion is a true exercise in persistence.
1 ||| A paper-thin, predictable family comedy.
1 ||| Under the direction of Andy Tennant, the Olsen sisters lay on the icky-poo cuteness with several trowels, often delivering their lines as though they were reciting the alphabet.
1 ||| To quote one of the characters, 'We mustn't! We mustn't!'
1 ||| Casino is left king-high by a wobbily high-heeled Sharon Stone and by an especially inept script and questionable direction.
1 ||| It's an ambitious film, but also a scattered, unfocused one.
1 ||| Captain! The Pretense-O-Meter's gone off the scale!
1 ||| Despite a lot of mayhem taking place on screen, the only memorable component of this ramshackle actioner is Hans Zimmer's score.
1 ||| It is one long, drawn out exercise in pain.
0 ||| I've never wanted to run from a theater so much in my life.
1 ||| Black Sheep is bleatingly awful as it reteams Chris Farley and David Spade, the poor idiot's Abbott and Costello, in a comedy so desperately inept it makes their previous effort, Tommy Boy, look like a minefield of high wit.
1 ||| Utter, unforgivable bilge.
1 ||| Imagine "Tommy Boy" without all the rapier wit and genius filmmaking technique. I counted one sincere laugh in the full 90 minutes.
1 ||| Exactly what you expect
1 ||| painfully unfunny
1 ||| It's nice to see the two together, practicing their easy screen rapport--and no doubt more so given Farley's untimely passing--but Black Sheep is still a clunker. [Blu-ray]
1 ||| Screamers is inundated with movie cliches, stock characters, stolen premises and scenes that just don't make sense.
1 ||| In its last minutes Screamers becomes the last thing it intends to be -- laughable.
1 ||| There's nothing exhilarating or enjoyable in any of this.
1 ||| Sacrifices last traces of plausibility and common sense for the sake of "surprise" twist that any experienced viewer could have predicted ages ago.
1 ||| There is little to offend in the movie, but neither is there much to engage the audience.
1 ||| The title changes, the actors change, and the superficial details of the story change, but it is always about exactly the same thing: heavily armed men shooting at one another.
1 ||| A hopelessly muddled mess.
1 ||| Silly update of the French classic; the ending is an unforgivable cop-out.
1 ||| The new Diabolique mostly dispenses with subtlety, contenting itself with regularly scheduled cathartic jolts that pass for suspense in our degraded culture.
1 ||| Interesting only for being so totally familiar, even if you've never seen another film about a Ghan-Gheng martial-arts match in an ancient Lost City in Tibet.
1 ||| In his first outing, it is unclear whether VanDamme can't manage the scope of this tale, or if he's just a bad director.
0 ||| Van Damme calls his film 'the Ben-Hur of martial arts'; boy, is he deluded.
1 ||| Whatever one might think of the increasing mindlessness of effects-driven blockbusters, you'd think they could at least manage to entertain, or to give you a reason to come back when you get up to go to the restroom.
1 ||| Cheguei  concluso, depois de assistir a este filme, que paguei o ingresso para ver uma vaca voando e o trailer de 'Misso: Impossvel'.
0 ||| The effects were great, the story was dumb. I hate this movie.
1 ||| The plot is minimal, and the character exposition full of cliches -- the scenes that don't feature tornadoes seem very long and almost unbearable to watch.
1 ||| The only thing scary about this film is watching Mark Wahlberg's career as an actor begin to dissipate.
1 ||| "The Arrival" is a good 20 minutes too long and heavy with useless scenes in which we learn far too much about Sheen's relationship with his girlfriend.
0 ||| It takes an exceptionally talentless screenwriter-director to make such a foul, boring, worthless descreation of DeFoe's witty, insightful and entertaining novel, and Densham is that incompetent.
1 ||| At least Mars Attacks tried to be funny.
1 ||| Big, dumb, glossy blockbuster designed for mass appeal is massively appalling.
1 ||| Forget government conspiracies about aliens -- what about the entertainment media's conspiracy to persuade America that this movie doesn't suck?
1 ||| Connery was very good in this role, and his presence is the reason why The Rock doesn't suck as bad as it could have.
1 ||| A spiritless affair likely to vanish quickly from first-run screens.
1 ||| An action-adventure Frankenstein's monster, cobbled together from pieces of other much better films -- and then nobody remembered to give it a jolt of energy.
1 ||| If Treat Williams were the Phantom and Billy Zane the capitalist villain would any significant nuances be lost?
1 ||| No one seems to be taking any of it seriously, especially as the dialogue reflects dumbed-down conversations and repetition for viewers who may not be paying attention.
1 ||| I'm sure it looked good on paper. That and Kilmer's frighteningly apt mimicry of Brando's voice are about the only positive things I can say.
1 ||| There's the obese Brando pretending to be God while dressed in gauzy white robes like a demented pope
1 ||| One of the greatest directors who ever lifted a megaphone, David Wark Griffith was 56 when he made this, his last movie, and it is a shame that he had to bow out with such a dud.
1 ||| There are no surprises here except for the indecipherable motivations and exacting length of two hours and twenty minutes.
1 ||| Nothing more than an entry in Matthew McConaughey's filmography.
0 ||| Only a screenplay by Akiva Goldsman could make things worse--and lo and behold, speak of the devil and Old Scratch appears.
0 ||| Ultimately, any movie in which even Morgan Freeman manages to give a lackluster performance can only be considered a seriously botched job.
1 ||| The film is dull and drags.
1 ||| Just one of the many Keanu speed bumps found in your local video store.
1 ||| Bad horror flick. Period.
1 ||| There are lots of gory in-the-mouth close-ups, showing teeth being destroyed, needles being jammed into the gums and other graphic indignities
1 ||| Terrible comedy. Depressing (he's basically going to die by 20) and the jokes are obvious. Williams is great and understated, but wasted in this script.
1 ||| Barf.
0 ||| If you're into despicable trash that is completely without redeeming value, Freeway is for you.
1 ||| Freeway is not good satire, it's not good comedy, and it's not in the least bit entertaining.
0 ||| The film wanders around aimlessly like a ship without a rudder or a captain.
1 ||| More ugly and depressing than haunting or suspenseful.
1 ||| Strike three, you're out. A stinker that should have been postponed because of inept filmmaking.
1 ||| Harriet the Spy has real character in some of its details, but it never feels like much more than a low-budget TV show.
1 ||| ...a tedious adaptation...
1 ||| While the well-loved novel was apparently about the admirable battle a kid must wage in order to become an artist in the face of peer disapproval, the movie seems to be about a mean-spirited tyke who has no scruples.
1 ||| The whimsical and meaningless first part dissolves into a mean spirited and disturbing concluding section.
0 ||| One of the year's worst movies... at least I hope so, or it's going to be a very bad year.
1 ||| So riddled with holes it's ridiculous.
1 ||| The film's action elements are so preposterous that the sequence of events seems almost improvised.
1 ||| An embarrassment of near epic proportions.
0 ||| Dickerson and screenwriter Joe Gayton have misguidedly tried to turn Wayans into a physical action star and evidently hoped that Sandler could act.
1 ||| Instead of being exhilarating, the excesses become exhausting.
1 ||| Even the most hackneyed of plot devices wouldn't overshadow the bad taste this movie's politics leaves in your mouth.
1 ||| A noxious, nerve-splitting invitation to vigilante rage.
1 ||| In an age that is nearly devoid of talented horror movie directors, it has become tiresome having to consider the inconsiderable, aggravating to search for rationales for the haphazardly assembled creations of people like Craven.
0 ||| First, it's not scary, and second, after seeing it, you may scream at yourself for wasting your time and money.
1 ||| The movie's only wrinkle is that it is, in a crude fashion, post-modernist. Pardon me while I alert the media.
1 ||| Boring and artificial
1 ||| I will cherish my memory of Chris at the end of In Love and War, bearded and bitter, drinking fiercely and trying very hard to be dark and tormented.
1 ||| Howlingly awful Die Hard retread.
1 ||| Turbulence thrashes about like a formula action picture that has stepped on a live wire: It's dead, but doesn't stop moving. It looks like it cost a lot of money, but none of that money went into quality.
0 ||| Lame, lousy, horrid. No wonder Jim divorced Lauren.
0 ||| A disaster--and not the kind that's fun to watch, either.
0 ||| Metro isn't a movie. It's bumper cars.
1 ||| Eddie Murphy has declared war on America's eardrums. His new film Metro, in which he plays a police hostage negotiator, must have been financed by a wrecking yard, with help from the stunt drivers guild.
1 ||| Murphy is fresh, as usual, but Metro is not.
1 ||| By-the-numbers doesn't begin to describe how cliche-ridden Randy Feldman's script is.
1 ||| Private Parts is nothing but an interminable infomercial about Stern's empty life.
1 ||| Leaky PT-boat of a comedy.
1 ||| I'm not even going to get into the dialogue, the plot, the other performances, because as the sage advice goes, if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.
1 ||| Sink it! Blub, blub, blub!
1 ||| Yet another recycled sitcom turned feature film, and is about as appealing as a failed television pilot.
1 ||| Suitable only for movie-goers who have undergone frontal lobotomies.
0 ||| The process of conceiving, producing, and distributing this comedic Superfund site required active, premeditated thought and effort that, in a just world, would be punishable by hard jail time.
0 ||| A useless movie. Not funny, suspenseful, moving or even offensive enough to want to torpedo. Just devoid of any conceivable value.
1 ||| This McHale's Navy would never have floated as programming ballast on a bad night of network TV.
0 ||| By the end, this soporific comedy makes 105 minutes feel more like a two-year hitch.
1 ||| How to turn a so-so series into a witless movie. Earns a half-star for Bruce Campbell.
0 ||| [Trots] out the same tired cliches -- unorthodox heroes, inept commanding officers, officious little weasels getting trampled by the zany crew -- which haven't been funny since...well, ever.
0 ||| Dear God, why?
1 ||| There's no real suspense here 'cause you don't care about anyone.
1 ||| I don't want to pay $7.50 to watch a movie imitate CNN.
1 ||| Movie bombs L.A. with lava, audience with stupidity
1 ||| You're better off reading the Cliff's Notes.
1 ||| Schumacher has said that he wanted to 'put some "comic" back in comic book,' but he forgets what comic book he's dealing with--Batman, which is a 'comic' book in name only.
0 ||| Nothing but a parade of obligatory one-liners and self-imposed cliches.
1 ||| A limp, excruciatingly shallow knockoff that leaves viewers cringing at the unavoidable one-liners.
1 ||| Bright, busy and visually diverting, but not very much fun.
0 ||| It insults the viewer's intelligence with lifeless acting and a tired script.
0 ||| We should put Schumacher in a room with R. Kelly's useless 'Gotham City' song playing at him over and over again until he wets himself and promises never to do it again.
1 ||| [An] abhorrent waste of celluloid.
1 ||| I didn't expect much from Batman & Robin and I didn't get much in return -- in that sense the movie delivered.
1 ||| This is just too much, like two hours of annoying TV commercials spiked with bad acid.
1 ||| Warner Brothers owns the Batman character; you would think they would have a vested interest in doing a good job of the films, but the films themselves prove that they don't -- and this film provides the most numbing, sickening, inane proof of all.
1 ||| Devoid of a point of view, a narrative structure, intelligent dialogue and three-dimensional (or even two-dimensional) characters, the latest Batman movie is much more like a violence-oriented video game than a form of dramatic art.
0 ||| The title that managed to kill modern-day Batman movies.
1 ||| Abandon hope all ye who enter here.
1 ||| Schumacher's intention appears to have been to make something so awful, so corny, so campy, so preposterously bad that audiences would simply laugh at it. Sorry. Bad is bad.
1 ||| This franchise has gotten aggressively unsatisfying.
0 ||| Among the worst wide-release films of the 1990s, offering virtually nothing in the way of positive compensation other than an excellent chance to mock it with a cadre of like-minded, drunk friends.
1 ||| I've seen colonic X-rays more visually appealing than what Schumacher throws up on the screen.
1 ||| Predictably dismal pop-operatic guff.
1 ||| Batman and Robin is the fourth film in the series but it's also the film that finally kills the franchise by putting Batman out of his misery.
1 ||| Perhaps most disheartening of all is the fact that every character in the film defies gravity, physics, and any form of logic in their clunky or obnoxiously vivid designs.
1 ||| Breakdown has plenty of deft action sequences, and what they add up to is nifty garbage disposal, with all of us -- characters, filmmakers, viewers -- ultimately spiraling down the same drain.
0 ||| Not even watchable. This freakish film defines "lowbrow."
1 ||| True pigtail tale is still bad
0 ||| Even the combined talents of Matthau and Lemmon can't save this sinking ship.
1 ||| Too embarrassing for Robbins
1 ||| Despite the snowman rape scene, this is not a fun B-movie. Nothing clever about it.
1 ||| The only thing melting was my poor mind.
1 ||| a kill
0 ||| At the media screening, the guy sitting behind me could be heard loudly snoring during the third act. We should all be so lucky.
0 ||| As dumb as George's I.Q. is low, and as funny as Fraser's career.
1 ||| Stupid
1 ||| Fraser is so earnest in his desire to make a family oriented, innocent film that watching him speak ape just has to make you chuckle.
1 ||| Packs the entertainment oomph of a free throw.
1 ||| Shaq, meanwhile should bag the movies and work diligently on those freebies. Knees bent, elbow steady, full follow-through... wish.
1 ||| Its sappiness and excruciating sentimentality weighs it down.
1 ||| It's really just a silly excuse for Shaq to play superhero and dodge exploding cars and fireballs.
0 ||| This fil
1 ||| Why does Shaq hate us so much?
1 ||| Shaq CANNOT ACT!
1 ||| It could be worse. Shaq could be rapping.
1 ||| What in God's name were they thinking???
1 ||| [Seagal's] action scenes are so one-sided that nobody in the film ever lays a finger on him. It gets boring.
1 ||| Fire Down Below is an action film that's deadly slow and stupid -- like most of the mountain people portrayed in the film.
1 ||| Not quite bad enough to call rancid, and that's the best I can say for it.
1 ||| Most Wanted is an overly familiar B-grade action flick...
1 ||| Weak action movie. Not enough thrills to elevate the totally average story.
1 ||| First-time filmmaker Mimi Leder builds a couple of suspenseful scenes in the last half-hour, but most of the story is stale and predictable.
1 ||| After more than an hour of solemn preparation, we get ... Brad Pitt showing a kid how to drive a car and work a radio. Wow.
1 ||| Three of the most obnoxious people ever born...all in one movie!
1 ||| Boring adultery drama, but nice Ming-na nude scene.
1 ||| This film isn't apt to light your fire and it's doubtful it will ignite much action at the box-office.
0 ||| When the film isn't using some stock footage of actual forest fires, the simulated ones look hokey.
1 ||| It's fast, simple-minded action with a lot of corny dialogue, preposterous circumstance and good looking people.
1 ||| In movies, as in life, you take your warmth where you can find it, but this particular wienie roast is bound to leave you cold.
1 ||| Unfortunately the film wafts toward Seven turf soon afterward and stalls on a heavy burden of metaphysical chitchat. Washington's dazzling good looks are the only reason to stick with it.
1 ||| Fall leans too heavily in the direction of vain and smug.
1 ||| Fall often feels like a remake of 9 1/2 Weeks, with Schaeffer seemingly competing with Mickey Rourke for most..disgusting sleazeball ever committed to celluloid.
1 ||| A laughably flimsy remake of a frequently told adventure.
1 ||| It is to scary movies what Sesame Street's 'the Count' is to vampires.
1 ||| An absurdly bad mixture of Rosemary's Baby and any Bette Davis movie from the 1960s
1 ||| This film is so bad, even good actors can't save it.
1 ||| Good news: It's very funny. Bad News: HUSH is a thriller.
1 ||| Lange seems at a loss to know how to convey Martha's malevolence -- and writer-director Jonathan Darby offers almost no guidance.
1 ||| I won't even go into the film's leaden ending here; suffice to say it's not nearly as interesting as what has come before, which wasn't very interesting to begin with.
1 ||| The film is so awful it doesn't even qualify as a B-movie.
1 ||| Hush has three very simple problems: it's incredibly dumb, it's incredibly boring, and it's incredibly predictable (at least up to the stupefying ending).
1 ||| How awful can a movie be? This awful.
1 ||| Only Nina Foch, as the wheelchair bound granny hidden away among nuns, shows any flair for taking this into the campy domain in which it might have flourished.
1 ||| Hush will always find a place at sadists' film festivals.
0 ||| If only TriStar had hushed writer-director Jonathan Darby when he made the pitch for this insulting thriller.
1 ||| Absolutely awful.
1 ||| Some reviewers have applauded Out of Sight for its nuances of character, but I and others don't see any characters at all.
0 ||| You may think you're ready for the possibility that a film could be bad, but little can prepare you for something as pointless, smug and misguided as The Avengers.
0 ||| It's appallingly awful!
1 ||| There's only one thing this movie has going for it--and you guessed it: Thurman in a catsuit.
1 ||| The TV series was a character-driven entertainment about two charming spies. The movie is an idiocy-driven 90 minutes of torture dreamed up by people who have no new ideas of their own.
1 ||| As bad as it is, though, I didn't hate The Avengers; I felt sorry for it.
0 ||| Scenes evaporate before your very eyes. Bad puns roll off the heroes and anti-hero's tongues and lay dead before your feet.
1 ||| It is not in any way camp. And without the camp you only have smarmy, sexist and stupid.
0 ||| DeWynter and his conspirators, seated at a long table, are all wearing fuzzy teddy bear suits, each in a different color of the rainbow. Everyone together now: WHAT THE F**K?
1 ||| Words like "bad" don't even do The Avengers justice. It's time to haul out the big guns, like "appalling."
0 ||| Seek out the show and you can enjoy one of the highlights of 60's pop culture entertainment while avoiding one of the low points of the 90's.
1 ||| This film is an absolute mess. It looks like the regurgitated leavings of something watchable, a cinematic abomination that got pulled apart and put back together so many times that it lost all semblance of coherence.
1 ||| The Avengers is out of place in our current cinema of excess; even Mrs. Peel's laudably skintight catsuit is played far too seriously.
0 ||| Oh, I am so angry I paid full price! Don't make the same mistake I did! I can save you the trouble and pain and bitterness. Listen to me. Don't go see it!
1 ||| I had heard it was bad... but this is downright silly.
0 ||| It will suck life force from you.
1 ||| To say Fiennes and Thurman don't have the chemistry of Macnee and Rigg isn't enough. They don't have the chemistry of Don Adams and Barbara Feldon. They don't have the chemistry of Boris and Natasha.
1 ||| Finnes and Thurman look great as agents John Steed and Emma Peel who set out to thwart Connery's diabolical scheme, but they have zilch for chemistry.
1 ||| Thoroughly and consistently awful.
1 ||| A horrifyingly bad movie by any measure; but it feels like the graphic proof of a vicious God in comparison to the television show.
1 ||| Somebody call Austin Powers, quick!
1 ||| The Avengers is, without a doubt, the worst movie of the summer.
1 ||| The cult 1960s TV series gets royally shafted by Hollywood in this stunningly designed blockbuster that's stunningly awful in every other department.
1 ||| This dull spinoff of the 1960s television series has a spectacular cast but little energy and no ideas at all.
1 ||| A few things you might consider doing instead of seeing The Avengers: Walking the dog. Turning the compost. Re-grouting the bathtub. Starting your 1999 taxes. Buying a dog. Starting a compost heap.
1 ||| An unmitigated disaster.
1 ||| The Avengers is so bad it even elicits a horrible -- even embarrassing -- performance from Sean Connery.
1 ||| Very terrible.
1 ||| Worthless but awfully earnest slapstick from Macdonald, who ain't finding the Big Screen quite so simple.
1 ||| A stupid lowdown vulgar comedy.
1 ||| For a film called Dirty Work, what ensues is rather clean of spirit.
1 ||| A movie that makes even Don Rickles unfunny.
1 ||| The jokes just aren't funny, and Macdonald's sardonic, 'non-acting' style of acting quickly becomes tiresome.
0 ||| [A] screamingly awful, achingly unfunny comedy...
1 ||| ...proves that a comedy doesn't need an R rating to be crude, rude, or stupid. Even an innocent PG-13 can do the trick.
1 ||| After two grueling hours of slicing and dicing, I hardly savored this time not well spent.
1 ||| Instead of plot, we're given a lot of breathlessly delivered backstory, overdesigned sets and Stephen Norrington's flat, suspense-defying direction.
0 ||| [It] could have used lots of sharpening.
1 ||| It's a gruesome, gore-filled fang-fest.
1 ||| [It's] dopey and lifeless.
1 ||| Boring vampire blood bath isn't for kids.
1 ||| Has the comic-book movie reached the end of the line? The glumly familiar, been-there-done-that aspect of Blade certainly suggests so.
1 ||| enough yuks to fill up a funny short subject
1 ||| Another nail in the coffin of the once hilarious Airplane genre.
1 ||| Stinky attempt to recapture the magic of "Airplane."
0 ||| An insipid science fiction action yarn that makes you long for the realism of Pigs in Space.
1 ||| If you didn't know any better, you would think I was about to describe the plot of a Chuck Norris or Jean Claude Van Damme straight to video film.
1 ||| It plays even worse than it sounds.
1 ||| The trick is that it could have been a treat.
1 ||| For testosterone freaks only!
1 ||| When it comes to details like plot, character development, and genuine excitement, the film is lost in space.
1 ||| This is a blood-and-bullet fest, tediously filled with lots of breaking glass, neck-crunching and spine-twisting action, and flamethrowers.
1 ||| Anderson's novel solution to slow-moving stretches is to add explosions. But when it comes to directing actors, he's at a loss.
1 ||| Wow. What a terrible movie.
1 ||| An hour of the film is shots of flora and voiceovers of soldiers, all of which sound like parts of Wings of Desire that Wenders left on the writing room floor.
1 ||| Sentimentality is a kind of fascism too, robbing us of judgment and moral acuity, and it needs to be resisted. Life Is Beautiful is a good place to start.
0 ||| I had thought The Other Sister was appalling in its exploitation of the mentally disabled to grab your entertainment dollar, but that was nothing, NOTHING compared to what the funny little Italian man has wrought.
1 ||| King Kong light. Insipid Joe Young. Just because this film is rated PG doesn't mean it has to be written on the level of an orangutan.
0 ||| Never get into a movie where you play opposite an animal, right? They should have listened.
1 ||| It's OK. It should not be fiscally encouraged, however. It's the greatest sin of Hollywood - competent but forgettable filmmaking.
0 ||| At first sight this film is terrible. At second sight, it's even worse.
0 ||| ...a flatulent space bomb. There may not be air in outer space, but you can smell this one a galaxy away.
0 ||| As lost as the audience gets, no one in the auditorium can come close to the bewilderment exhibited by the cast.
0 ||| This tepid trek makes Saturn 3 look like 2001.
0 ||| Murky and dull.
1 ||| Light on originality and low on suspense.
1 ||| a half-baked science fiction rip-off that manages to be both excruciatingly simplistic and utterly incoherent at the same time
1 ||| Vince Vaughn's Norman Bates is about as terrifying as a tranquilized dachshund.
1 ||| Even with its surreal shot-for-shot sense of recreation, what we wind up with here is hubris meshed with an affront to every genre fan's sense of propriety.
1 ||| An utterly empty technical achievement.
1 ||| It's not so much that this movie didn't need to be made. The real tragedy is that a group of enormously talented people wasted several months of their lives when together they could have done something fresh and exciting and original.
1 ||| The script is too muddled to be remedied by vigorous filmmaking.
0 ||| Unfortunately, not a good picture.
1 ||| Gloria is another sad example of what happens to old masters when they become too prolific.
1 ||| Sputtering like a two-day old campfire, the story plays like an ad-lib sketch that was never polished or completed.
0 ||| You always have to be careful with the initial releases of any calendar year.
1 ||| Nothing -- I mean nothing -- works in this film.
1 ||| How many cliches can one film incorporate or steal from other movies?
1 ||| It's rare to find a movie that makes this little sense.
0 ||| Curtis's earnest performance would be better suited for a more intelligent, exciting script, one where "What the hell was that?' and 'What the hell is going on?' don't make up 95% of the dialogue.
1 ||| The dialogue tends toward the obvious, and the characters are constantly explaining what is happening to one another.
1 ||| The last shot is an homage to The African Queen, a movie I earnestly recommend instead of this one.
0 ||| This disgustingly gory science-fiction/horror film also bears a striking resemblance to last year's equally graphic Deep Rising and nearly surpasses that film with its sheer stupidity.
1 ||| It's so unmemorable that I couldn't recall what movie I had seen while the credits were rolling.
1 ||| 95 minutes of unrelieved tedium.
0 ||| It's dead in the water.
1 ||| Why tell a tale -- especially so unimaginatively -- which has been told so many times?
1 ||| Monster movie is a monstrous failure.
1 ||| Even Donald Sutherland in the potentially juicy role as a self-serving old sea dog, is wasted in this big budget ill.
1 ||| Frankly, about 20 minutes into this dud, I was rooting for the alien beasties.
1 ||| "This is very stoopeed, Stevie." I must have repeated that line to myself a dozen times before this abysmal techno-thriller shuddered to a much-appreciated end.
1 ||| If you're looking for comedy nutrition here, you'll find yourself in stand-up anorexic hell.
1 ||| Formulaic, obvious and very slow!
1 ||| Murphy and Lawrence never quite move beyond shtick.
1 ||| Anyone out there buy David Spade as a romantic lead? OK, didn't think so.
1 ||| Spade may be a professional when it comes to mugging for the camera, but he can't save this thing.
1 ||| A movie about characters of limited intelligence, who wander through the lonely wastes of ancient and boring formulas.
1 ||| Why was the sight of scrawny Woody Allen kissing pretty Diane Keaton never revolting, while scrawny David Spade kissing beautiful Sophie Marceau in Lost & Found is the creepiest cinematic sight of the year?
1 ||| An inoffensive, eminently forgettable bit of fluff.
1 ||| Nothing but a cynical, astonishingly inept attempt to copy Mary's formula.
0 ||| Universal has done the unthinkable--they've created the Anti-Matrix, the summer event movie you simply have to avoid.
1 ||| The Mummy fails to reconcile image and tone!
0 ||| The most stupefyingly incompetent animated feature to reach the big screen in recent memory.
1 ||| It's too bad Marvin isn't still around, to at least knock some sense into his old friend, Boorman.
1 ||| Its smirking sense of humor and generic self-consciousness suggest that Payback would like to think of itself as a hip descendant of Pulp Fiction. But the movie is utterly devoid of narrative ingenuity and visual and dramatic flair.
1 ||| Payback is not, in any way, an entertaining film.
1 ||| An inept farce with the mentality of a tittering 15-year-old boy peering under the bedcovers with a flashlight.
1 ||| [An] early contender for most inept comedy and worst film of the year.
0 ||| A cold, stupid bore about people with no goodness, just geniality; no inner life, just impulses.
0 ||| This movie is not merely bad, but incompetent. I get tapes in the mail from 10th graders that are better made than this.
0 ||| There is no structure or dramatic tension to the film, which is just a bunch of aimless scenes of people exchanging witless, pseudo-hip dialogue.
1 ||| The gags and situations are but repetitions and variations on dull, ribaldly worn and reject elementary Farrelly Brothers scribing.
1 ||| At least Alison Eastwood and Suzanne Cryer are good at getting naked.
1 ||| This charmless ensemble comedy starts out amiably enough, but quickly succumbs to the triple handicap of poor direction, a badly written script and some alarmingly excessive performances.
1 ||| You aren't likely to build up much holiday cheer by forcing yourself to sit through this torturous ninety-minute debacle.
1 ||| I'll Be Home for Christmas is like the tableau in a snow globe -- after all the whirling (and blatantly artificial) snow has settled, not a single figure has actually moved or changed.
1 ||| I'll Be Home for Christmas will appeal to people who fail to care if nothing good happens in a movie.
0 ||| Family fare. Pure, sweet, and PG-rated.
1 ||| Bah, humbug!
1 ||| A Christmas turkey.
1 ||| This is a film about deeply confused people that seems likely to put viewers in a state of deep confusion for most of its running time.
1 ||| Rehashes every Star Trek: The Next Generation episode where the holodeck goes haywire.
1 ||| As cold and sterile as a piece of machinery.
1 ||| Good cop/bad cop junk we've all already seen a million times before. The beautiful Gina Gershon spices it up a bit. Still not worth watching.
1 ||| The supporting cast includes Ron Silver (playing yet another smarmy guy) and Alison Eastwood, which leads me to wonder what the initial script looked like (compared to what ended up in the final product), because this is a pretty bad little flick.
1 ||| So far gone, it's irredeemable.
1 ||| This is wild. Absolutely wild. I had to watch an hour-and-a-half of white kids in dreads...
0 ||| The movie is simply bad bad bad.
1 ||| It's hard to imagine the idea even looked good on paper.
1 ||| Now we have proof: It's possible for the Jim Henson folks and Industrial Light and Magic to put their heads together and come up with the most repulsive single creature in the history of special effects!
1 ||| Not to be confused with the horror film of the same name, this Jack Frost is still so frightening I'd hesitate to put it before any child who ever plans to see a snowman.
1 ||| If Jack Frost doesn't prove that Hollywood is not only creatively bankrupt but actually in the hands of minions of Satan, then I don't know what does.
0 ||| The film is shoddy from frame one.
1 ||| It will no doubt appeal to eight-year-olds, but anyone older than that can pretty much be prepared to get to know their watchface very well.
1 ||| It took a lot to be the worst reincarnation fantasy titled Jack Frost from the second half of the 1990s, but by golly, they found a way.
1 ||| It took four screenwriters to come up with dialogue so horrendous, it could have single-handedly ushered in a new era of silent cinema. "You the man!" "No, you the man!" "No, I'm the snowman!"
0 ||| The characters in the story make one stupid decision after another, as if they were trying hard to fail the ultimate pop quiz.
1 ||| Legs will flail underwater. Big red buttons will get pressed in slow motion. Dialogue will be stilted and overly expository, unless it's a quip. Glass will be broken.
1 ||| Harlin, in telling a standard tale of morality and conflict, turns in a plotless, empty picture that dissolves into an emotionless videogame.
1 ||| I don't know, maybe I'm spoiled. But we've already seen Jaws and we've already seen The Abyss, so do we really need a low-rent combination of the two?
0 ||| Harlin, perpetrated, I mean, directed CUTTHROAT ISLAND, but oddly enough, it did not stop studios from giving him big bucks to repeat his mistakes.
1 ||| Rare is the terrible film that's this upbeat and delightful and entertaining.
0 ||| The idea that this film is supposedly based on the classic novel by Jackson is an insult to the author. The words 'insinuated by' would be more factual.
1 ||| It's just a conglomeration of cheap fright tactics and a booming bass track meant to get you to jump out of your seat.
1 ||| One of the stupidest movies you'll ever see. Bad, bad, bad.
1 ||| This all-flash, no-substance--and no scare--thriller is a textbook example of soulless, money-burning Hollywood hype products.
1 ||| The only thing scary about the new version is realizing that someone keeps giving director Jan De Bont money to make movies.
1 ||| A flat, draggy exercise in cheesy special effects and grandiose art direction palming itself off as a horror film.
1 ||| I wouldn't waste more than the price of a video rental on this one.
0 ||| When you're not yawning at the digital ghosts, you're watching a cast of fine actors dogpaddling in cliches and terrible dialogue.
1 ||| The bombastic overkill that helped make De Bont's Speed 2 the most disappointing sequel of the decade is in full bloom here.
1 ||| ...an adaptation that manages to fare even worse than its subpar source material.
1 ||| Reduces Shirley Jackson's disturbing portraiture into a puzzle box with the solution written on the outside.
1 ||| It's a feeble comic spin, at best!
1 ||| It was ok for what it was, but that's not saying much.
1 ||| This is one that history will very quickly forget.
1 ||| The only thing 'too deep' about this movie is the apparent lack of respect its creators must have for audiences -- it is literally an insult that such an abysmal failure has made it to market.
1 ||| In the end, In Too Deep becomes just another bad movie about bad people doing bad things. With none of the glorious fun we used to have watching Pam Grier strut her stuff.
1 ||| Too Shallow!
1 ||| Although it is based on a true story, the subject matter has been covered too many times to care, and the by-the-book plot plods along to an anti-climatic finish.
1 ||| For the most part the actors are forced to ham it up in order to get through cliche-ridden scenes, but a few manage to overcome the burden.
1 ||| What's saddest about this film is the impact it's likely to have on Kaufman's legacy.
1 ||| Andy Kaufman biopic is hollow, even with Jim Carrey's chameleonlike performance.
1 ||| Piles one loony twist on another with dizzying abandon when it's not bogged down drinking up scenery that has been exploited to a fare-thee-well on the big screen.
1 ||| The saddest thing about this flotsam is how much money it pulled in.
1 ||| It just doesn't flow, giving the feel of too many writers and/or directors.
1 ||| I suggest you simply watch the commercial and save 105 minutes of your life.
1 ||| The way the screenwriters treat the law is in many ways similar to way they treat intelligence of the viewers.
1 ||| The tag line for Diamonds promises that 'searching for buried treasure was never this much fun.' Replace 'much fun' with 'dull' and that marketing slogan suddenly gains a lot of truth.
1 ||| It's a male-bonding road movie that veers off a weary course filled with dreary clichs on the way to a possible treasure in diamonds. The trip is barely worth it.
1 ||| Diamonds feels like it was conceived as a showcase for Douglas at 83, and so it is, but what a dreary story and unconvincing characters he has been surrounded with.
1 ||| I have to admit I shed some sentimental tears during the movie, so it's not really very bad at all, but it could have used a script polish.
1 ||| Douglas struggles honorably with his stoke-impaired speech and a shoddy story.
1 ||| Mary Katherine's best suited for the small screen, so wait for the video.
1 ||| About as funny as an oozing fever blister.
1 ||| There are some pretty goofy moments here, but the movie looks like it was just thrown together as a quickie to capitalize on SNL's anniversary.
1 ||| Shannon offers a one-note performance that's ultimately more silly than sustaining.
1 ||| Here is a portrait of a character so sad and hapless, so hard to like, so impossible to empathize with, that watching it feels like an act of unkindness.
1 ||| A funny character with a couple of trademark catchphrases does not on its own constitute a funny movie.
1 ||| Bikini waxing and pulling chin hairs is much more enjoyable.
0 ||| A stick-figure Rembrandt that provides neither the quick surreal poke of a TV satire nor the full lustre of an actual movie.
1 ||| Seriously awful one-joke stupidity.
1 ||| I've seen this sketch numerous times on SNL -- it isn't funny at five minutes, at 90 minutes it's unbearable.
1 ||| House On Haunted Hill is not only never scary, it's never even interesting.
0 ||| House on Haunted Hill is a sorry reincarnation of the 1950s William Castle horror film.
1 ||| Malone tosses wandering lunatics, mad doctors, and hell's spawn into the mix right off the bat, which then makes it all that much more difficult to maintain an air of unease throughout.
1 ||| Slow-moving, yawn-inducing.
0 ||| Geoffrey Rush shamelessly overacts with a vengeance in this chillingly awful movie, which leaves us with one nagging question. Can Oscars be recalled?
1 ||| Consistently inert -- even though the fee for successful housesitting has been raised to a million bucks a night.
0 ||| Quarts of shiny blood are splashed around and numerous moans and groans pepper the soundtrack, but astonishingly, the movie never manages to provoke so much as a shudder.
1 ||| The climactic house-versus-humans scenes were so ludicrous that I half expected Kattan to revert to his Mr. Peepers persona from SNL and start battling the evil inkblot with spat-out chunks of apple.
0 ||| Someone tell me please--what is the point of this film?
1 ||| It's a rare comedy that is so painfully unfunny that it earns not a single laugh.
1 ||| we care so little and know so little about the characters, we feel tiresome and slumberous
1 ||| O'Donnell and Zellweger are easy on the eyes, but we're asked to take it on faith that they have other qualities that would make a person care for them.
1 ||| O'Donnell, former teen idol/Boy Wonder, has always proven to be far less beefcake than rice cake.
0 ||| Step into the darkened theater and the familiar smell may not hit you immediately. Watch your step, though, because A Dog of Flanders is nothing but cinematic doggy poo.
1 ||| Horrible adaptation of a wonderful story. Rent the anime version, instead.
0 ||| What a disaster.
1 ||| A thriller completely lacking style, suspense, and sense, but full of snow globes galore!
1 ||| Sominex: The Movie
0 ||| ...sometimes the film aims for sentiment, sometimes it tries to be funny, other times it wants to be completely revolting...
1 ||| It isn't insultingly bad; it's just incompetent.
1 ||| If you see and like it, then never read a movie review again: there's no need, since you will enjoy every picture you see.
1 ||| Atmospherics trump story.
1 ||| Eye of the Beholder attempts to convey emotional dislocation and passion at the same time. All we get is distance.
0 ||| Perhaps Elliott was trying to make a point about the futility of voyeurism, and if that's the case, it backfires, for it brings to light how much of a waste watching Eye of the Beholder is.
1 ||| Eye of the Beholder wants to be an art film and a thriller. It fails at both aspirations. If you'll pardon the expression, there is far less here than meets the eye.
1 ||| One for a rainy day and a Valium, this is slow-melting psychometrics at their worst, and a clear misfire for Elliott.
1 ||| Impenetrable mess of a movie.
1 ||| Eye of the Beholder suffers from blurry vision at best. Don't let your eyes behold it.
1 ||| I can't elevate this above Rental level, because it was creepy, worth seeing, but kind of dumb.
1 ||| It's late January, winter is entrenched, and in the lull between the bounty of Christmas and the renewal of spring, the big screen can sometimes seem barren -- a movable famine.
1 ||| Eye of the Holder makes you wonder how bad are the scripts that Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor turn down.
1 ||| As if to make up for the disjointed quality of the story, director Elliott has incorporated various themes into the film, such as the repetitive use of snow globes, angel statues, and astrology... Unfortunately, these things only pretty up a bad picture.
1 ||| On the bright side, I only lost an hour and half of my life watching this piece of [expletive deleted], unlike those involved in the making of it, who lost months.
1 ||| It's not good when you check your watch every 20 minutes during a 107-minute movie. It's bad when you think, "Yeaahh, rrright" almost as often.
0 ||| A pointless and trifling mystery fable.
1 ||| If I want to watch folks sit around and berate each other and dog women while making millions of dollars, I'll watch WWF
1 ||| Bottom line, this is American Pie for boys-will -be- boys in the fiftysomething age range.
0 ||| This movie wants to be sweet and dark at the same time, but it is as distant as a planet's satellite.
1 ||| Shandling has such a narrow acting range. He seems like an emotionless alien from beginning to end, especially in contrast to Bening.
1 ||| Bogs down in weak dramaturgy about love and commitment.
1 ||| Here is the most uncomfortable movie of the new year, an exercise in feel-good smut. What Planet Are You From? starts out as a dirty comedy, but then abandons the comedy, followed by the dirt, and by the end is actually trying to be poignant.
1 ||| The movie offers not one shred of insight, comic or otherwise, into the eternal conflict between the sexes.
0 ||| Who wants to watch a bunch of people that seemingly hate each other trapped in a small house for an extended period of time?
1 ||| Another lowest-common- denominator high school romance made from the cannibalized parts of equally unambitious teen fare.
0 ||| With a running time of 92 minutes, Whatever It Takes is too long by an hour and a half.
1 ||| An assembly-line high-school comedy that flunks miserably in all three subjects.
0 ||| The script's way of handling its romantic complications is unusually obtuse and insensitive.
1 ||| Made-for-TV blandness.
1 ||| This is about as lame as teen comedy/romance films come.
1 ||| Whatever It Takes is one of the worst and most inept teen movies I've seen since last year's Jawbreaker.
1 ||| Please, oh please, make these teen-targeted romantic comedies go away.
1 ||| This is simply an assembly of cinematic cliches.
1 ||| Carries the rank stink of hokum, and nasty hokum to boot.
1 ||| It's hard to shake the feeling that somebody's being condescended to.
0 ||| It's too bad [Portman and Frain's] contributions, and those of many others, drown in a big glop of treacle.
1 ||| Where the Heart Is fails to build much emotional momentum.
1 ||| This film is terrible.
1 ||| This is as irritating as chick flicks come and it's a real disappointment since Portman's talents are totally wasted.
1 ||| For each of its grotesque 84 minutes I stared at the screen depressed and appalled, realising I was watching something historic -- the moment when feature-length Disney animation became a dinosaur itself.
1 ||| Plot? What plot?
1 ||| Plot? What plot?
1 ||| By 45 minutes into the movie, I was nudging my friend and asking if he was as bored as I was.
0 ||| After watching this thankfully brief comedic abomination, one can't help thinking it was conceived during a 14-martini lunch.
1 ||| Pitiful excuse for a film.
1 ||| The film's comedy falls like a thud in the path of forward progression, impeding laughter, believability, and sustained interest.
0 ||| Danny DeVito is the only cast member who succeeds in making something out of the movie's nothing of a screenplay.
0 ||| Screwed is a low-brow dognapping caper comedy that had all the early warning signs of a real stinker.
0 ||| I can't imagine any other filmmaker doing much worse with the already-poor material than they have.
1 ||| If you want to see a cinematic Hamlet go see the Olivier or Brannaugh or even Mel Gibson. At least their versions make sense.
1 ||| So poorly produced and directed that there would be serious doubt that the cast speaks English if it were not made up of such well- known and accomplished actors.
0 ||| I guess Johnny Depp was busy, so they got the one that can't act.
1 ||| 2000 version of Hamlet is just dreadful.
1 ||| Gone in 60 Seconds plays like a picture made by the numbers, for the numbers.
1 ||| Drama and thrills are the key elements missing in this film.
1 ||| Cage has found a movie to challenge Snake Eyes and Eight Millimeter as the dumbest of his career.
1 ||| As uninspired as it is insulting
1 ||| Gone in 60 Seconds goes so stale in its last 10 minutes that it makes The Rock look like some experimental flick.
1 ||| It's a movie that could honestly be said to star cars, not actors.
1 ||| And I thought Mission: Impossible 2 was boring.
1 ||| Doesn't rise to the level of its excellent trailer.
1 ||| So clumsy is the film that while our 'heroes' are 'boosting' their 50 cars in 24 hours, the audience never has a clue how many they have successfully stolen.
1 ||| For car lovers and lovers of truly bad films only.
1 ||| A film that fails to satisfy on any level.
1 ||| The movie isn't about much of anything, which you will find out if you can manage to stay awake.
1 ||| This is just not a good movie.
1 ||| Reflects our wish to redeem ourselves through sacrifice. But that entails more than briefly nodding to our flaws, magnifying what we like best about our past, and waving it around, hoping the euphoria will resolve any contradictions.
1 ||| The In Crowd is one of those obscure features that a distributor sneaks into the summer marketplace when no one is looking.
1 ||| This college-age thriller is the second of two similarly themed movies this Spring about secret societies, with the other being The Skulls in February.
1 ||| Porno theater patrons who stumble into this pic purely for its endless landscape of girlie grillwork will get their money's worth.
1 ||| A thoroughly disposable psycho-thriller aimed at the teen demographic, and one of the very worst theatrical films of its type in recent memory.
1 ||| It's fairly slow-moving, and after a long buildup, the promised thrills never arrive.
1 ||| A glossy piece of trash.
0 ||| It gives melodrama a bad name.
1 ||| What on earth possessed anyone to put it on the big screen?
1 ||| The story is sad and pathetic, unbelievable for more than a second to anyone with less than 45% alcohol in his or her blood stream.
1 ||| It's so bad that even the kids, who (let's face it) aren't a very discriminating audience, were hooting at it during an opening-day screening.
1 ||| It seems to think it knows something we don't, which makes it just as obnoxious as the over-privileged, over-sexed, over-boozed world of beautiful people it deigns to let us in on.
0 ||| full of attractive, listless actors who apparently couldn't get jobs on any of the WB's teen soap operas striking poses and mouthing dusty dialogue.
0 ||| There was no advance screening for this movie, so I actually had to pay to see this one myself. Don't make my mistake, because I'll never see that eight dollars ever again!
0 ||| This is the stuff of good, clean, campy fun. But instead of titillating, The In Crowd is nothing but a deadly dull business.
1 ||| Somebody wrote this, directed this, and wrote out checks for the actors. They all have family somewhere proudly boasting that their child makes movies in Hollywood.
1 ||| Stone the crows! Or is that flog the dead horse? Either way, this is cobblers.
1 ||| The press release makes a "special request" to not reveal the ending. They didn't need to worry. Anyone over PG-13 age is going to know exactly where this movie is going long before it gets there.
1 ||| The In Crowd's deep, dark secret? That it, too, is just a mediocre movie-of-the-week in feature-film clothing.
1 ||| Dark and twisted, with sexually suggestive undercurrents, this one's as safe to miss as a sunburn by the club poolside.
0 ||| The most mundane, most out-of-touch college romance of the year?
1 ||| A shockingly awful movie.
1 ||| Loser is just as it sounds.
1 ||| A rote treatment of a tired subject.
1 ||| It's a feel good British movie ideal for gangs of middle-aged, middle-minded women on bored afternoons, and toxically saccharine to anyone else.
1 ||| Little more than a ridiculous action film with a plot as believable as the Warren Report, ugly violence that would have made Peckinpah cringe, and terrible acting by B-list actors.
0 ||| Ludicrous, impenetrable and headache-inducing: the newest Wesley Snipes film, The Art of War, is all that and more.
1 ||| The Art of War makes no sense at all.
1 ||| Overly plotted and too coincidence-ridden for a story that's basically about nothing, this is a film that almost is not there.
1 ||| The Art of War is drenched with a script so incomprehensible you'd prefer Chinese water torture than wracking your brain trying to keep score.
1 ||| If Wesley Snipes were TWICE as cool as he thinks he is...this movie would still stink.
1 ||| Even the mystery of the double and triple-crosses doesn't really matter; it devolves into a bullet-dodging, body-battering, scenery-demolishing collection of brawls.
1 ||| You can't help but feel that screenwriter Barry Fanaro could have tried a little harder to write his own dialogue and create his own story rather than ride on the coattails of a great film.
1 ||| The laughs in The Crew are memorable for their scarcity.
1 ||| Yeah, nothing funnier than old men farting and Viagra jokes.
1 ||| A forgettable made-for-TV-like production.
1 ||| Its ambition is considerably larger than its budget, resulting in a film that looks absolutely dreadful - and to be honest, its ambition is not particularly lofty.
1 ||| A handful of plot points recognizably follow the source material, almost making a game of picking out the morsels of faithfulness.
1 ||| Just serviceable bunker thriller that asks the question, "Would you want to survive The Big One if it meant being stuck [underground] with the kind of guy who spent his life preparing to survive The Big One?"
1 ||| Essentially the picture is one tease after another, misdirecting as fast as it can and amounting to the "Emperor's New Clothes" vacuousness of mid-period M. Night Shyamalan.
1 ||| I couldn't help but see the very visible thread line where the original film ended and the new ending was tacked on to make it a Cloverfield film.
0 ||| Almost every element of the film has been seemingly engineered to be the ne + ultra of slapdash ineptitude.
1 ||| 10 Minutes Gone wastes the talent of two Hollywood greats. Bruce Willis and Michael Chiklis are just collecting a paycheck here.
0 ||| For a film so bent on naturalizing the presumably hilarious incongruity of "the sexes," it sure features lots and lots of that site of horror: a naked male body. And for comedic purposes, of course.
0 ||| This retrograde sex comedy is embarrassing for just about everyone involved ...
0 ||| One of those films of which there's absolutely nothing nice or pleasant to say.
1 ||| How much does this movie suck? Let me count the ways.
1 ||| The movie wimped out by blanding down the story and the characters to the point where she isn't really a shrew and he isn't really a maniac.
1 ||| Those looking for violence and bad Italian stereotypes won't be bothered by the fact that they've seen almost all of this before.
1 ||| A mix of the first half of Donnie Brasco, the last 20 minutes of A History of Violence and a couple of episodes of I Love the'90s.
0 ||| Numbingly incoherent.
1 ||| Given that they left out some scenes it was a bait and switch.
1 ||| The film becomes an endurance test of tedious -- even painful -- labored dialogue and flat, counterfeit emotions.
1 ||| Byrum's lackluster, ambling script and Bruce Paltrow's unimaginative reading of it routinely stand at cross-purposes with a first-class cast.
1 ||| If karaoke were an Olympic sport, this American entry would finish out of the medal round. Way out.
1 ||| In addition to its other shortcomings, Duets is awfully slow in getting going.
1 ||| A conceptual train wreck.
1 ||| Has a far better cast than it deserves.
0 ||| Guys, quick huddle here. If your girlfriend even suggests seeing this movie, you might want to consider these time-tested words: 'Satan, go ye hence from the soul of my girlfriend. I shall not abide thy evil channeling.'
1 ||| A tedious ordeal, riddled with unlikable characters, recycled gags, and inane plot developments.
1 ||| Every mushy element of the script is robustly wrung for every last drip of sap.
0 ||| Beautiful ain't. Sally Field may be proclaiming "You like me! You really like me!" behind the camera, but don't be egged on.
0 ||| The lead character in this film ... is one of the most reprehensible human beings that I have ever had the displeasure of watching at the movies.
1 ||| A mess of a movie that suffers from awkward writing, a plot with major disconnects in plausibility, an annoyingly screechy kid character and cheesy production values.
1 ||| A movie with so many inconsistencies, improbabilities, unanswered questions and unfinished characters that we have to suspend not only disbelief but also intelligence.
1 ||| Some will argue that this review is cruel, and they may be right -- but so is being losing two hours of one's life to this inexcusably bad tripe.
0 ||| It manages to find an almost pitch-perfect accumulation of ill-matched tones, sheer grotesquerie, near-heroic absurdity and self-canceling folly.
0 ||| The movie is so nasty to its mostly female characters that it feels harshly misogynist.
1 ||| Does it have to be so painful to watch? Every performance is gratingly awful, and all the roles are badly miscast.
1 ||| Pior do que a direo de Sally Field, s mesmo o carter desprezvel da personagem principal: uma mulher egosta, ftil e irritante. Ao longo do filme, eu no queria apenas que ela perdesse o concurso; queria que ela sofresse.
0 ||| An uneasy mix of broad satire, soap opera outlandishness, and movie-of-the-week sappiness.
1 ||| Stallone is so artificial, tanned and leathery you could replace his mouth with a zipper and sell him as a pocketbook.
0 ||| The stylish murk seems to signal that everyone on the technical crew had his own agenda, each trying to outdo the others.
1 ||| slow moving
1 ||| Note to Stallone: Stop making movies!
1 ||| A truly rotten remake of Michael Caine's classic 1971 UK gangster pic.
1 ||| The primary problem is that Lurie just can't direct. He rushes and bumps through his somewhat appealing script in the first half.
0 ||| Another cheesy, overdrawn and witless Saturday Night Live takeoff.
1 ||| Desperately unfunny.
1 ||| Yawnnnn.
1 ||| I went into this film with very low expectations and was still disappointed.
1 ||| Used to be Halloween was the scariest event each October. Recently, the most horrifying thing is the release of another comedy based on a Saturday Night Live sketch.
1 ||| ...Hampered as much by the film's third-rate script as Meadows's own weakness as an actor.
1 ||| The Ladies Man is a total dud.
1 ||| Lorne Michls has crapped out another one that is only worth catching when it finally makes its way to cable.
0 ||| Just when you thought they couldn't get worse, Saturday Night Live-based movies hit a new low.
1 ||| Another Saturday Night Live sketch character tries, futilely, to stretch to feature-length proportion...
1 ||| The only moments of terror in this ostensible horror flick are brought about by the appearance of the words 'Producer: Meg Ryan,' giving you chills in a way that only those words can.
1 ||| Rosemary's Baby 30 years later.
0 ||| Dumber than Stigmata, murkier-looking than The Crow, and about as scary as C.H.U.D.
1 ||| Occasionally Lost Souls shakes itself from its coma-inducing torpor just long enough to be aggressively dumb.
0 ||| A shamelessly dull, difficult-to-grasp foray into not the dark but the dim.
1 ||| Its characters are so colorless and uninvolving that it's hard to take them seriously.
1 ||| The barely relieved boredom is, apparently, an attempt to contradict David Byrne's contention that only 'Heaven is a place where nothing really happens.'
1 ||| This slow-paced spiritual thriller is remarkably short on thrills, unless you've never seen a movie about exorcism.
1 ||| While it's beautifully shot, it's way too slow. And it isn't one bit scary.
1 ||| Quite possibly the silliest of the recent bunch of Satan- is- coming- to- eat- your- soul movies.
1 ||| The talented actors ... have no hope of overcoming Pierce Gardner's uninvolving, unimaginative and unoriginal script and first-time director Janusz Kaminski's lackluster direction.
0 ||| A pretty dreary affair to sit through. It's not even scary.
1 ||| This movie would have to rise three grades to qualify as a silly knockoff.
1 ||| A frustratingly fragmented, unconvincing movie.
1 ||| Est destinada a acabar directamente en el infierno correspondiente a las peores pelculas del ao
0 ||| With the original Exorcist back at the multiplex, you don't need this pale copy.
1 ||| Oh my God! THIS is what we're having for dinner?? AGAIN???
1 ||| [An] unholy mess of a flick.
1 ||| Even a cameo by John Hurt fails to make this film worthwhile.
1 ||| There's a good reason this lackluster fright-fest sat on the shelf for two years. It's nothing more than a tired Winona Ryder vehicle taking advantage of the topic du jour -- demonic possession.
1 ||| Mood alone cannot energize this slow, simplistic, and anticlimactic Exorcist pretender.
1 ||| The anticlimactic, is-that-all-there-is ending winds everything up not with a bang, but a whimper.
1 ||| Most of the characters are just plain boring.
1 ||| The only thing less attractive than the silly hairstyles of the competitors is the obvious machinations of the plot.
1 ||| Blow Dry seems both overplotted and underimagined.
1 ||| [Malena is] Renato's -- and Tornatore's -- sex fantasy, never a flesh-and-blood woman.
1 ||| Everything Fellini had once done with phantasmagoric flair ... Tornatore turns into a vulgar spectacle of screams and slaps.
1 ||| For those of us who love Cinema Paradiso, the news that its Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore and his musical soulmate Ennio Morricone were getting back together to do another coming-of-age film, Malena, gave us tantalizing hope. Malena fa
1 ||| this is sex with all the passion of a geometry proof and all the awkwardness of a junior high school dance . . .
1 ||| Originality is clearly not a strong point with this script.
1 ||| An action comedy that can be called just about anything but funny.
1 ||| I don't know which is the worst part of the film: Eddie Griffin's overacting, Orlando Jones' non-acting, or the ugly mutt that passes as Griffin's sidekick.
1 ||| The first hour of the story, whose rampant unexplained mysteries will leave you scratching your head in wonderment.
0 ||| Slick, self-assured, and thoroughly awful, Double Take is a primo contender for worst movie of 2001.
1 ||| Double Take is the kind of double-triple-reverse movie that can drive you nuts because you can't count on anything in the plot.
1 ||| Sketch humor isn't enough to salvage a feature when the plot ties viewers needlessly in knots.
1 ||| A shell game passing as entertainment.
1 ||| The plot itself is simple. The twists are simply thrown in to make it seem complex.
1 ||| ...rent Midnight Run instead...
1 ||| So logy and doom-laden that watching it feels like a hike through waist-deep snow.
1 ||| Moving with the speed of a paddle-boat upstream, the bulk of the movie is about as exciting as watching someone fish.
1 ||| It fails to create the deeply threatening vacuum that is the original's claim to enduring fame and resonance.
1 ||| We flinch, we cover our eyes. Mostly, we just retch.
1 ||| A loathsome, indefensible work.
0 ||| An excuse for all types of revolting and offensive gore.
1 ||| There are moments of a good movie buried amongst this over the top thriller. But these moments are all too rare.
1 ||| We know [Rock] can bring smarts and laughs. Just not here.
0 ||| A ham-handed fantasy that manages the damn near impossible feat of making Chris Rock unfunny.
1 ||| For a comedy, there are precious few real laughs.
1 ||| Heaven can wait and so can the audience for the new Chris Rock comedy ever to catch fire.
1 ||| Most surprising, Chris Rock isn't even consistently funny in the scenes he should have been able to do in his sleep -- his character's stand-up routines.
1 ||| A feeble effort that feels interminable even at a lean 86 minutes.
1 ||| Chris Rock is funny and talented, and so I have said several times... This project must have looked promising, since the directors are brothers Chris and Paul Weitz, fresh from American Pie. But the movie is dead in the water.
1 ||| Rock can't really be expected to pull off the love scenes, but for a man trying to reach the largest possible audience, his comedy is surprisingly uninspired.
1 ||| The material is so far removed from what it originally was ... that the stretch has made it shapeless.
1 ||| "Down to Earth" crashes instead of alighting on angels' wings.
1 ||| To put it bluntly: this is a bad movie.
0 ||| Rock saw the untapped goldmine of humor, found when a white person acts black.
1 ||| What keeps it (barely) from being completely intolerable is Keanu Reeves' hilariously awful lead performance.
1 ||| If I were a guy, and a gorgeous woman took me into her apartment, had passionate sex with me and supported my ass for a month, it'd change my life, too! Perhaps this is more romantic science fiction than anything.
1 ||| Beware all male viewers who enter here, you are in chick-movie hell.
1 ||| Defies all comprehension.
1 ||| This is a film that means to be seductive but merely progresses from the contrived to the manipulative.
1 ||| I don't know who I disliked more intensely -- Nelson, the abrupt, insulting ad man played by Keanu Reeves, or Sara, Charlize Theron's narcissistic martyr.
1 ||| Should have been called Cloying November.
0 ||| Who on earth could resist Charlize Theron? Well, if she's imitating Sandy Dennis, it's not all that hard.
0 ||| Is it still necrophilia if two corpses have sex with each other?
1 ||| In instances like these, you have a certain clich about a kitchen sink in the back of your mind, but this is probably the first instance where they do throw it in.
1 ||| A hard-to-swallow fantasy.
1 ||| A movie made up of nothing but low points.
1 ||| Forgettable affair.
1 ||| Chick flicks have a set of genre rules and expectations all their own, just like big, dumb action pictures for men.
1 ||| A romantic comedy with insights into sex and relationships that are old and obvious.
0 ||| Elizabeth Chandler's script has, by my count, exactly one sort-of-funny line and not a single scene whose comic possibilities are successfully exploited.
0 ||| It's cheap and it's lowdown, and to those responsible for this exercise in devolution: Honestly, I'm not sure I want to know someone like you.
1 ||| I don't use the word "tripe" very often. But for some reason, during most of the running length of Tony Goldwyn's sappy romantic comedy Someone Like You, that word kept running through my mind.
1 ||| This will be no review -- this will be a disection. A desecration even. I plan to slam this infantile piece of poopy from top to bottom, inside and out. And I will give away every piece of it.
1 ||| Strong story telling, character development and acting, off-putting subject matter.
0 ||| It's a terrible film that made no effort of anything but to find a track and go real fast in hope that we wouldn't realize we were only going straight and making lefts.
0 ||| A music video shot by a Cops camera crew on crystal meth.
1 ||| Even fans of open-wheel racing, the high-speed, high-stress pastime that is the subject of Renny Harlin's hectic new film, may walk away from it more logy than exhilarated.
1 ||| The only glimmer of any acting in evidence is by Robert Sean Leonard as Jimmy's heartless brother and Gina Gershon ... The rest of the cast appear to be either escapees from a fashion shoot or wax museum versions of once famous action stars.
1 ||| As hollow and fundamentally false as a video driving game
1 ||| Feels desperately overscripted and straight out of an early Seventies TV movie of the week.
0 ||| Red flags (not checkered) abound in the banal script, silly dialogue, and the age-defying stretch marks on the face of Burt Reynold.
1 ||| Stallone and Car Racing: Just goin' around in circles.
1 ||| Less a look at Formula One than a pilot for a flat sub-Aaron Spelling sudser that just happens to be set in the world of auto racing.
1 ||| Despite a couple of action packed race scenes, it would be more fun spending the day in a traffic jam.
1 ||| Renny Harlin drives this film into the ground.
1 ||| There's no flow to this movie -- it just plods along from one disconnected sequence to another.
1 ||| Takashi has been considered a master auteur. Perhaps, but there's no art here, just violence.
1 ||| It's hard to believe that these two would ever hook up.
1 ||| The product is so synthetic it has only attitude where its heart ought to be.
1 ||| "Stay with me" Jennifer Lopez whispers over and over at the start of the film. Take my advice: Don't.
1 ||| Director Luis Mandoki lets another film drown in the tear-jerker tide.
0 ||| Its protagonists, their situation and its mechanical but mushy resolution are never remotely believable.
1 ||| Angel Eyes is not a movie for watching. It is a movie for passing by and avoiding.
1 ||| Call an ambulance. This mess is in need of a bodybag.
1 ||| Let's hear it for stupendously dumb screen writing.
1 ||| "Think of a dumb, demented Island of Dr. Moreau Saturday Night Live spin-off."
1 ||| This movie is a rabid beast that should be put to sleep.
0 ||| Certainly reeks like something produced from a squatting position.
0 ||| It's a great yawning void where Rob Schneider can hump a mail box and attempt to seduce a goat.
1 ||| Evolution is bad. How bad? Who cares? Do you ask how hot the fire is before running out of a burning building? No, you just run for safety.
1 ||| Flat, rickety and enervated.
1 ||| Perhaps Reitman was so desperate to create the next Ghostbusters and to take advantage of Duchovny's X-Files appeal that he forgot to read the embarrassingly awful script.
0 ||| The director takes a step backwards with Evolution, relying on potty humor and special effects to cover a dim-witted and derivative plot.
1 ||| Look! Up on the screen! It's a bird! It's a-plain! It's super-lamebrain, man!
0 ||| It is deeply boring, blindly paced, and humiliating for me, who had nothing to do with it.
1 ||| Part of the problem with Evolution -- aside from the fact that it isn't really very funny -- is that it's mostly jaded; there's very little gee-whiz, almost no awe.
1 ||| The young and the restless with gas fumes.
1 ||| Rob Cohen, who last directed The Skulls -- ouch! -- can consider this one another career-killing skid mark.
1 ||| Frequently feels like a long music video advertisement for some new cars aimed at the youth market.
0 ||| When is somebody going to make a decent movie about cars? Between this and Gone in 60 Seconds, it's enough to give out tremendous nosebleeds to most of the populace.
1 ||| a jumbled blur, overlaid with a pulsating hip-hop score.
1 ||| More like "The Lame and Laborious".
1 ||| Trash like The Fast and the Furious really boils my blood.
1 ||| At first it's an exhilarating ride with original action scenes that quickly become routine when they are thrown at the audience over and over.
1 ||| Middlingly racist, humorless, and downright inept, Pearl Harbor is solely for fans of fireworks factories.
0 ||| "Titanic" meets "Saving Private Ryan" with a good dose of "Gomer Pyle" added to the brew... could have been subtitled "World War II for Dummies."
1 ||| A bloated, waterlogged catastrophe that looks and feels phony in every detail, from the mossy clichés of Randall Wallace's script to the gleaming computerized perfection of its curiously bloodless battle scenes.
1 ||| The attack sequence in Pearl Harbor shows technical smarts to spare. Where matters of emotional and political truth are concerned, it's crude and jingoistic beyond compare.
1 ||| On December 7, 1941, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. On May 25, 2001, Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay did it again.
1 ||| ...the ending seems so unfinished that it leaves audience members feeling like they've been stranded in an active battleground.
1 ||| Director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer's World War II behemoth has only three operating modes: sub-Titanic romantic mush, jingoistic hokum and lovingly rendered carnage.
0 ||| A cheerfully offensive rape of history.
1 ||| Boring, unpleasant and ghoulish. Surely the people who died at Pearl Harbor deserve better than this.
1 ||| A mindless action movie passing as a serious war epic that is dragged out, unsure, and quite random.
1 ||| [Pearl Harbor] makes no attempt to teach a lesson in history, for fear of losing the interest of 12-year-olds and high-school teeny-boppers. Insulting.
1 ||| Pearl Harbor is what you get when you cross Independence Day with Titanic, with the result possessing the good qualities of neither. The movie gave me a stomachache, literally.
1 ||| May be the closest thing to a good movie Michael Bay will ever direct; unfortunately, it's still not very close to a good movie.
1 ||| There's a certain symbolic symmetry here. The Navy and Walt Disney have teamed up on the production, and both view history as something to be managed and exploited.
1 ||| Even the much-vaunted depiction of the Japanese attack, while often visually arresting, still suffers from over-frenetic editing and more emphasis on adventure thrills than befits the tragedy of Pearl Harbor.
0 ||| A tepid, wannabe-Titanic love story, under the stewardship of a man whose career has ranged from the emotional depth of an 11-year-old boy all the way up to a 13-year-old boy.
1 ||| ... sensationalizing real events for a meaningless film, then coasting on a huge budget and advertising to lure in moviegoers thinking they'll see historic accuracy and drama.
1 ||| Monkeying Around.
1 ||| The script is a pathetic hodgepodge ... the acting is horrible, and the 'surprise' ending feels like a swing from a ball-peen hammer into the temple.
1 ||| Neither a thought provoking metaphor for racism, nor a jaw-dropping blockbuster loaded to the max with action.
1 ||| In a film at least tangentially about evolution it strikes me as poignant that in 31 years, this Planet of the Apes is actually a good deal dumber than the original.
1 ||| ... not a "remake" so much as a "revisal," a new take on old material. The problem is, no one connected with the film seems to have any idea just what that "take" is.
1 ||| A spiritless, unimaginative exercise in professionalism for its own sake.
1 ||| In retrospect, it's a small jump from Shakespeare to God. What if Gibson had been stopped then?
1 ||| The big problem with Big Trouble, despite a fine cast and director, is that the damn thing isn't funny.
1 ||| The maid runs away screaming, something that you'll feel like doing many times during the movie.
1 ||| Is there ever a good time to release a film that endorses bribing airline personal for tickets to carry a suitcase containing a ticking nuclear bomb onto a plane?
1 ||| Contradicts itself because it's a ramshackle comedy that's both rowdy and neatly pressed.
0 ||| A wearisome stab at screwball comedy.
1 ||| The laughs are few and far between.
0 ||| Based on a novel by Miami Herald columnist Dave Barry, but has none of the writer's trademark wit.
1 ||| A little weak -- and it isn't that funny.
1 ||| Too scattered, too convoluted and far too hyper to get any workable comic steam going.
1 ||| What director Barry Sonnenfeld surely intended to be farce now only seems forced, and even actors as self-sufficient as Allen and Russo seem utterly flummoxed.
1 ||| Big trouble, indeed. Memo to Hollywood: Retire that title for another few decades, at least!
1 ||| Laboured, wheezy and almost completely unfunny.
1 ||| Faithful to the events in Barry's novel, lifts a good deal of his witty dialogue, and recruits a proven cast of laugh-winners. Why, then, is it so resolutely unfunny?
1 ||| [Script] has all of the signs of being computer generated. The N-word and the F-word are mixed liberally and randomly...
1 ||| The film aims low and scarcely lives up to its own diminished expectations.
1 ||| A sloppily edited comedy laden with sub-amateurish acting, a script with less direction than a broken compass, and a sense of humor that never made it out of the junior high bathroom.
0 ||| Boring and desperately unfunny.
0 ||| A depressing, stereotypical affair that can be thanked by the African American community for portraying their race as lazy, drug-addicted, and whorish.
1 ||| Halfhearted and badly edited, the picture itself seems stoned.
1 ||| Just not particularly amusing.
1 ||| What could have been a delicious hoot about dysfunctional dynamics in a disillusioned workplace merely ends up as a woeful, clunky comedy of errors.
0 ||| I'd be shocked if even a totally wasted Phish fan could find many laughs.
1 ||| If a white filmmaker were behind the wretched ugliness that is The Wash, he'd be branded the most racist director since D.W. Griffith.
1 ||| Never comes off as desperate--because little effort appears to be put forth by writer-director-co-star DJ Pooh.
0 ||| There's precious little to listen to, laugh at or ogle.
1 ||| Straight up...I didn't laugh once during this entire flick!
0 ||| The Wash is Santo & Johnny through a swamp of mounting disinterest.
1 ||| A 100% feeble comedy that exposes the dire acting abilities of two otherwise well respected hip-hop artists.
1 ||| You've really got to wonder sometimes how talented people end up in hopeless misfires like this film.
1 ||| [A] crude and boring movie.
1 ||| I was wishing I was sitting through Bones a second time.
1 ||| Waterlogged from start to finish
0 ||| Abort! Abort! It's that time of year when Hollywood releases movies it should never have made in the first place.
1 ||| I'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - Arnold is not, nor will he be, back.
1 ||| Head-scratchingly ordinary.
0 ||| Enough similarities to Gymkata and Howie Long's Firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs.
1 ||| An exhausted rehash of Mr. Schwarzenegger breaking through red tape to struggle against his nemesis of the moment.
1 ||| A ridiculous premise inhabited by a poorly developed hero and incomplete villains.
0 ||| Don't make any sudden moves, back away slowly, and whatever you do, don't make eye contact
1 ||| Plays like a bad adolescent revenge fantasy on Ritalin, all jagged editorial edges and silly, pumped-up testosterone.
1 ||| David & Peter Griffiths pretty much wrote this one in their sleep.
1 ||| Like the excruciating End of Days, Collateral Damage presents Schwarzenegger as a tragic figure, but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions.
1 ||| Reduces itself to a highly simplified story about an overly aggressive victim, who is conveniently empowered to carry out extraordinary tasks in unknown territories.
1 ||| Both offensive and flat
1 ||| The question remains whether Americans are ready for a film whose plot hits so close to home. The answer: Americans are always ready for mindless, predictable crap.
1 ||| In a world where the cost of real violence and the sacrifices of real heroes are inescapable reality, there is no connection to be made with the empty, ersatz heroics of a movie like this.
1 ||| Rule of thumb: if Arnold Schwarzenegger is the smartest person in a movie, you've got problems.
1 ||| The whole South American adventure looks so forced you half expect Schwarzenegger to break into a travel programme piece to camera.
0 ||| More 'it stinks' than 'NSYNC.
0 ||| The expensive but soporific Texas Rangers is no Unforgiven, to put it mildly -- in fact, it's more like unforgivable.
0 ||| An unapologetic flag waving military action flick that just happens to suck really, really bad.
0 ||| Convoluted to the point of sheer stupidity.
0 ||| It's like an amalgam of Ghostbusters, Alien and the Pokemon movies -- - all the good parts.
0 ||| After seeing this rancid excuse for a film my lifelong obsession with Scooby-Doo was ripped out of my wiggling brain faster than my appendix was sliced out of my belly during last year's appendectomy.
0 ||| ... represents the very essence of taking a studio-owned property and sucking out its soul ...at the expense of everyone that once cherished it.
0 ||| The most horrific movie experience I've had since "Can't Stop The Music." It may as well be called "Jar-Jar Binks: The Movie." It's that painful.
0 ||| Not only eviscerates the spirit of the shows, it stomps on it for good measure.
0 ||| Far more dull and just plain dumb than it ever is funny.
0 ||| Sexless Britney is also blas Britney and Crossroads might as well be a dry-hump through a Baby-Sitters Club book.
0 ||| The only thing separating Crossroads from a Showtime soft porn is the lack of any actual nudity. Like its star, the film is just a highly inappropriate tease.
0 ||| It does wonders to a critic to know that you could be a continuing font of teen and post-teen kitsch for years to come.
0 ||| So mind-numbingly awful that you hope Britney won't do it one more time, as far as movies are concerned.
0 ||| Utterly formulaic and forgettable teen trifle.
0 ||| Within 20 minutes of this incongruous baloney, I knew I'd stumbled upon a potential Razzie.
0 ||| Every nanosecond of the The New Guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable. Something like scrubbing the toilet. Or emptying rat traps. Or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife.
0 ||| It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen.
0 ||| Every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it. The New Guy is one of them.
0 ||| You know after only 10 minutes that this atrociously unfunny high-school comedy is a dud.
0 ||| Hopefully this is the beginning of the end for raunchy teen comedies. I don't think my heart could bear another train wreck like this.
0 ||| One sits there wondering if all the fizzled and obvious gross-out and slapstick gags are supposed to be funny.
0 ||| No words can describe how truly awful this movie is.
0 ||| The secrets of time travel will have been discovered, indulged in and rejected as boring before I see this piece of crap again.
0 ||| I found myself glancing at my timepiece about every ten minutes of the interminable 96-minute running time of this latest tragic remake of a classic genre picture.
0 ||| ...pitiful, slapdash disaster. A DOA dud from frame one.
0 ||| Human Nature, in short, isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is; neither is it as smart.
0 ||| In its own way, Joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a Luis Buuel film without the latter's attendant intelligence, poetry, passion, and genius.
0 ||| One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out.
0 ||| In terms of actual social conscience, the movie gets a demagogic, rabble-rousing F.
0 ||| A movie that hopes its idiot demographic won't notice the wave of vile stink slopping off the screen.
0 ||| It's a lot like a bad movie once removed, which is to say that it's exactly the kind of bad movie that characters in a movie sometimes go to see.
0 ||| Julia is played with exasperating blandness by Laura Regan.
0 ||| I walked away not really know who "they" were, what "they" looked like. Why "they" were here and what "they" wanted and quite honestly, I didn't care.
0 ||| Why Scream director Wes Craven allowed his name to be attached to this uninspiring lump is a mystery. Whatever he was paid, it wasn't enough.
0 ||| 'Wes Craven Presents.' Such an endorsement is meant to be a mark of quality, and indeed it is--bad quality, that is.
0 ||| Far too predictable, irritating and never engages the viewer.
0 ||| No yacht was harmed during shooting. It's the movie that's the shipwreck.
0 ||| Staggeringly dreadful romance.
0 ||| Even camp status eludes this tepid and misguided picture.
0 ||| New ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is.
0 ||| Writer-director Ritchie reduces Wertmuller's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon.
0 ||| Swept Away's worst crime is that it is butt-numbingly B-O-R-I-N-G.
0 ||| As an actress, Madonna is one helluva singer. As the Mediterranean sparkles, 'Swept Away' sinks.
0 ||| With her meager acting skills, overwrought mugging, shrill line delivery and quasi-Brit accent, Madonna makes Amber far more monstrous and comical than was obviously intended.
0 ||| Alas, the only surprise was in seeing how little a top-notch director can do with a woman who simply cannot act.
0 ||| More than annoyed, or angry, I just felt sad. Sad for what is quite possibly the premature death of a once-brilliant directorial career.
0 ||| [An] utter piece of flotsam.
0 ||| Utterly lacking in charm, wit and invention, Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film.
0 ||| Best described as slipshod, annoying and quite simply, shockingly bad.
0 ||| The only way this Pinocchio can have a fairy-tale ending is if you leave in time to get your money back; then you might live happily ever after.
0 ||| Chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly.
0 ||| It's a frightful vanity film that, no doubt, pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni.
0 ||| If you saw Benigni's Pinocchio at a public park, you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police.
0 ||| Head-slapping, what-the-f*ck-is-this-for-real? trippiness.
0 ||| It's nothing short of a comedy catastrophe and a criminal waste of talent.
0 ||| Anger Management: a film that irritated me so profusely I wanted to seek just that.
0 ||| Both American AND French cultures get shortsighted, religious and political moirs into fidelity are brushed away and the film shifts from melodrama to farce to tragedy and back to comedy (using that term lightly) at the drop of a razor.
0 ||| Think Blue Crush without water - or awesome surfing footage, likable characters with real personalities, beautiful girls in bikinis or anything else worth watching.
0 ||| 'Skateboarding is not a crime' ... but the movie is -- a tasteless, plotless, brainless, humorless, charmless and endless crime against cinema.
0 ||| Humourless, hackneyed yawnfest.
0 ||| 'Grind' rather economically describes the experience for anyone above age 11 who wanders into this skateboarding 'Rad' retread for 'jackass' fans.
0 ||| There is nothing remotely entertaining about this film.
0 ||| Striving for street cred, I'm positive even skaters will turn their noses up at this.
0 ||| Director La Scala can't direct his way out of this can of half-baked beans.
0 ||| Don't believe the hype, as the only frightening thing about this effort is how it received a nationwide theatrical release rather than an instant burial in the straight to video market.
0 ||| An unholy mess.
0 ||| House Of The Dead is laugh-out-loud funny. I should add, however, that it is not a comedy.
0 ||| It's a botched attempt at filmmaking that could easily become a midnight staple along the lines of Showgirls, as aesthetically frazzled as Ed Wood's finest, and as howlingly, inadvertently funny as, well, pick a Sybil Danning movie, any movie.
0 ||| You'd be hard-pressed to find a duller, more incompetent -- and less scary -- flick with cheesier effects in a remainder bin crammed with direct-to-video horrors.
0 ||| I want my ninety minutes back.
0 ||| A movie is a movie, not an outlet for the most expensive arcade game ever made.
0 ||| Dead is so artistically and creatively bankrupt that it boggles the mind just how a miserable little picture like this could sneak into theaters and enjoy a theatrical run.
0 ||| The acting is more frightening than the undead themselves and the gore is lacking, simple as that.
0 ||| At first, I was riveted by its awfulness. Then, about 20 minutes later, I just wanted to go home.
0 ||| Sad to say that after its unpromising opening minutes, the film defies the odds by getting progressively worse.
0 ||| Resides amid half-remembered fragments of Cinemax soft-core, Turkish remakes of The Exorcist, and third-string Troma releases such as Fat Guy Goes Nutzoid.
0 ||| There is an extended sequence in which every individual character goes bullet-time, and [Uwe] Boll must think it's so cool just because they're in bullet-time.
0 ||| How do films like these get made for video, let alone the wide theatrical run?
0 ||| So willfully opposed to everything that decades of refinement have established as cinematic grammar that I am unable to decide if Boll is a genius or just evil.
0 ||| Five minutes into the picture and I felt my inner child weeping for the future of the industry.
0 ||| Elicits groans and the wrong kind of laughter.
0 ||| But nothing is done well in this...outhouse of a production. Nothing. Yes, I know I'm repeating myself. Nothing.
0 ||| Casualties of this wreck are numerous and unfortunate.
0 ||| If there's a movie with a lower IQ released this year it'll be a miracle.
0 ||| Kahn delivers an action pic whose CGI effects more closely resemble a video game than reality and whose organizing principle is the three-minute music video...
0 ||| ... The ninth circle of gearhead Hell.
0 ||| ...too much and too little all at the same time...
0 ||| ... try to do too much, which leads to problems with the movie's tone.
0 ||| I used to think that there was nothing worse than a bran muffin, but then I saw The Girl Next Door and really found out what 'dry' and 'tasteless' mean.
0 ||| This is a dishonest, quease-inducing 'comedy' that had me feeling uneasy and then unclean.
0 ||| If it had been a porn film, at least it would've been made by people with some insight into the adult-film milieu, as opposed to people with insight into nothing.
0 ||| Jack Black is just Bill Murray without the talent and wit, while Ben Stiller doesn't get a chance to shine in this one.
0 ||| A weirdly airless disaster.
0 ||| Weisz... has the most thankless role and was apparently instructed to play her like Jennifer Tilly in heat.
0 ||| To use the obvious metaphor and equate 'Envy' to what Jack Black's miracle product is designed to clean up would be an insult to the canine digestive system.
0 ||| [A] comedy that lands with a deadening thud.
0 ||| Charlie Kaufman possibly could have uncovered this story's true smugness. Instead, Jack Black and Ben Stiller exaggerate what works about their styles to the point of annoyance in a can't-miss misfire akin to John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd's "Neighbors."
0 ||| A talented cast is completely wasted.
0 ||| The Punisher is such a bad film that it becomes inadvertently entertaining.
0 ||| Whoever first had the big idea of revisiting this material should be hung up by his Buster Browns and forced to watch the result -- then he'll know what 'punishment' means.
0 ||| Standard, styleless revenge fantasy.
0 ||| For most of its running time Valentin rambles along in the same gear, providing few highs or lows and generating any real emotional excitement only in the last reel, by which time you've either fallen for the kid or zoned out.
0 ||| ...an unforgettably excruciating experience.
0 ||| It's a tossup whether the crying jags are inspired by this jumbled script or by the fact that Willis has made six dreadful movies in a row.
0 ||| As time capsules of our defeated, misanthropic age go, Hostage is pretty good. As cash grabs go, it's pretty despicable.
0 ||| Doesn't even have the wit to be energetic, funny or humane en route to being inane, irritating, and corrosive.
0 ||| Think twice about getting involved with the woman who reared these two little sadists. Maybe these two rotten apples haven't fallen far from the tree.
0 ||| It COULD have been something, but...
0 ||| An elaborate equation consisting entirely of bad horror tropes and trashy psychological symbolism.
0 ||| One long, intolerable wait for the viewers, who can hear the gears of the script creaking.
0 ||| The last weekend of January is traditionally a dumping ground for turkeys at the multiplexes, so don't say you weren't warned.
0 ||| It is one thing for a movie to be boring and awful, but it is quite another to be insulting, in bad taste, and utterly ridiculous at the same time.
0 ||| The film grows more comic as it's supposed to be scary.
0 ||| As a critic, I've often been bored and offended by the movies I've watched, but Cursed may be the first time I can remember being outright insulted by one.
0 ||| They weren't just scraping the bottom of the barrel here; they were lifting it up to see what gunk clung to its mouldy base.
0 ||| While there's little substance in front of the camera, there's somehow less behind it.
0 ||| ...it's hard to imagine anyone walking away from the film satisfied (this includes the folks responsible for making the movie).
0 ||| I'm sure the filmmakers want it to start a dialogue about race, but this film has about as much racially unifying power as Rodney King.
0 ||| The different stories never end up balancing. The dialogue is simple, too flat, despite very good intentions. [Full Review in Spanish]
0 ||| I've seen lots of horrible movies this year. I can't imagine them getting any worse than this.
0 ||| ...just another fat sitcom loser who never changes and his young, gorgeous, savvy wife who apparently doesn't have the self-respect to dump the schmuck.
0 ||| Unless you're related to one of the actors, there is absolutely no reason to see The Honeymooners.
0 ||| It's not as bad as the average Hollywood movie, it's stupendously worse.
0 ||| Thank God Jackie Gleason and Art Carney died before they could see this.
0 ||| For a prime example of Hollywood's dearth of imagination one need look no further than STEALTH
0 ||| Stealth is a pretty fair military-hardware action movie until you start thinking about it -- at which point it turns incredibly sour in your mouth.
0 ||| ... Watching this movie becomes physically painful.
0 ||| So cosmically god-awful that it raises the bar for such upcoming titles as Dukes of Hazzard, Deuce Bigalow and SuperCross.
0 ||| More of a flying turkey than a tale of airborne action, "Stealth" begins to nosedive moments from its liftoff until it spirals out of control about half-way through.
0 ||| For at least the first hour, Stealth is a SAEBCPSOS (Shockingly and Excruciatingly Boring Columbia Pictures Sack of S---).
0 ||| A disastrous failure.
0 ||| Interminable from minute one...
0 ||| ...a thoroughly awful, downright insulting piece of work.
0 ||| Etheredge-Ouzts can't scare us, because the plot is so random, with no suspects, no hint of why the killer is slicing off peoples' heads and no indication the police have noticed the mounting pile of bodies.
0 ||| this hopeless morass that has all the exuberance of damp lint and even less imagination.
0 ||| So confounded lazy and stupid that it makes your head spin.
0 ||| There's nothing clever about this movie. It starts too slow, plot points are abandoned and even the killings start to run together.
0 ||| After The Skeleton Key, another lifeless Deep South horror movie charting the myriad frights of costumed black people performing defense rituals.
0 ||| The death scenes are so unimaginative and the gore is so minimal that you might miss it if you blink.
0 ||| ... even by the logistically malleable standards of the horror genre, Venom lacks even the barest rudiments of the form ...
0 ||| Uh...ewww!
0 ||| This movie is so bad, two lives into Nine Lives, I started counting how many lives I had to watch until I could leave.
0 ||| Even after 18 years of seeing every movie that plays here, I'm still surprised by some films. I even gave this one conflicting ratings.
0 ||| Broad stereotypes engaged in shallow versions of complex issues.
0 ||| If it were any more obtuse, The New World would be a flipbook where the moving picture was obscured by a thumb drawn over the stick figures.
0 ||| The Ringer is astoundingly craptastic not because the handicapped are handled poorly...but because it's one of the most singularly unfunny films ever made.
0 ||| The Ringer manages to avoid offending anyone -- the handicapped athletes are a savvy bunch -- but it also fails to provide any semblance of intelligence or wit.
0 ||| Curious George is unbearable animated torture: monotonous, hackneyed and lethally cute
0 ||| The funniest thing about Big Momma's House 2 is what I believe to be a grammar error in its press notes.
0 ||| A partial list of things that are more amusing than Big Momma's House 2: Beverly Hills Cop, Fletch, the original Big Momma's House, every sitcom currently on TV, open-heart surgery.
0 ||| A dreadful debacle made wors by Lawrence's promise/threat: 'Keep a lookout. You never know when Big Momma might be back.'
0 ||| It's a shame to once again witness Martin Lawrence squander his considerable comic talents under a fat suit and fake breasts in this shoddy sequel.
0 ||| So desperate that barely a half hour passes before we get the inevitable jokes about Dr. Phil, Oprah, Al Sharpton, Tupac and Billy Dee.
0 ||| The Promise employs laughable computer effects and second-rate martial-arts fighting to tell the hard-to-figure story of a princess and her three lovers.
0 ||| It is such a catastrophic failure that it is amazing to consider it was ever allowed out of China and into the global cinemas.
0 ||| Hoodwinked, what big stink you have.
0 ||| It's as if Hoodwinked was put together in some back alley with a Commodore 64.
0 ||| Exacerbates difficult issues by blowing them into underdog sports cliches and, more damning, race caricatures and slapstick, sitcom misunderstandings and pat rapprochements.
0 ||| Don't demean this picture. This isn't just one of the worst sports movies of all time; it can hold its own with the worst of any genre. If you're not a basketball fan, this film is boring, manipulative, and banal. If you are a basketball fan, it's worse.
0 ||| Why must Hollywood lace every African-American drama with elements of comedy, as if black people find everything comical?
0 ||| Repulsive and repugnant film, filled with bet-we-can-make-you-puke moments, it basically dares you not to run out of the theater screaming.
0 ||| torturously unfunny and thoroughly aggravating... the year is still young, but don't be surprised if 'Date Movie' is the worst film of 2006.
0 ||| Having Oprah scold you while a dentist performs a root canal on you with no Novocain on live national television would be more fun than sitting through this.
0 ||| As an entertainment consumer reporter, I can save you money right now. Don't by a ticket to see this movie! It's only February but it's a contender for one of 2006's Worst.
0 ||| The American moviegoing audience is, by and large, made up of deranged howler monkeys.
0 ||| The movie sputters along on borrowed gags without improving them.
0 ||| Sticking it to every ethnic group and sexual preference possible, Date Movie is, at least, an equal-opportunity offender.
0 ||| Cat flatulence, worn-out jokes about Jennifer Lopez's anatomy ... did I say there was a movie here?
0 ||| Friedberg and Seltzer's philosophy seems to be - make fun of other movies first, worry about our own movie second. Of course, that means their movie is no good
0 ||| The kind of brutally painful movie-going experience generally associated with the lesser efforts of Rob Schneider.
0 ||| Take your date to this laugh-less stinker and it may be your last.
0 ||| Director Seltzer and his co-writer Jason Friedberg throw everything they can at the audience in the hope of generating laughter, but the only chuckles I heard arose when a screamy, apparently unchaperoned little wild child took a spill.
0 ||| Mss Hannigan, who had she not currently been in a hit TV show, might have had her career destroyed by this turkey.
0 ||| It's painful.
0 ||| completely devoid of charm, wit, humor, or a storyline that makes sense to anyone with even the most rudimentary of verbal skills
0 ||| The titular canine hero has all the appeal of a talking bathmat. The animation is ugly, and the American re-write -- which, in typical Hollywood fashion, confuses topicality with humor, as if simply namedropping is enough -- adds nothing.
0 ||| A wretched experience from start to finish.
0 ||| The characters (a snail, a cow, a rock-n-roll rabbit, a train, a wooden soldier) and voice actors (Whoopi Goldberg, Judi Dench, Chevy Chase) seem chosen at random...
0 ||| A clunky doofus, a comedy of meet-cutes and weak jokes.
0 ||| At one point, Syd (Chris Evans) says, "I just want something to turn the pain off. Give me something." That's the way I felt watching this movie.
0 ||| A fiasco.
0 ||| London is a coke-snorting catastrophe, full of endless scenes of chiseled morons trying to be Socrates. You're better off getting relationship advice from a Magic 8-ball.
0 ||| Let's hope this movie hasn't come out too early in the year to be remembered for a well-deserved Razzie.
0 ||| As shallow as a toilet bowl and twice as rank as its usual contents.
0 ||| As misunderstood movie monsters go, Kane's Jacob can't even get in the ring with bedeviled Quasimodo of 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' or even Frankenstein's monster.
0 ||| Amateur Hour-and-a-Half....It isn't fit for human consumption.
0 ||| The madman is played by the single-name professional wrestler Kane, who has all the acting skills of a fire hydrant. But why waste good acting on a contrived, unimaginative story?
0 ||| Grim, bloody and relentless, without even a spark of fun or intelligence, Evil is barely good enough for late-night cable.
0 ||| A loathsome, repugnant slasher/thriller
0 ||| A predictably gruesome compendium of splatter-movie clichés, See No Evil is a reprehensible exercise in lowest-common-denominator filmmaking that disgusts and bores in equal measure.
0 ||| This rote exercise in slasher-film tedium holds zero surprises.
0 ||| After her appearance in Godfather III, I didn't think it was possible that I could hate Sofia Coppola more, but her Marie Antoinette really takes the cake
0 ||| Without daddy's money...Coppola's emaciated screenplay would still be moldering on her hard drive as the author worked the 10-4 shift at the Starbucks on Figueroa.
0 ||| The sound recording is hollow and muddy, the cinematography underlit and sometimes blurred at the edges, and the whole thing has the dreary feeling of a bottom-of-the-barrel, clammy '70s sex comedy.
0 ||| Eventually, the oh's becomes 'zzzzzz's.'
0 ||| The Oh in Ohio's childish storytelling, paper-thin character development, and general unfunniness combine to make one bad movie.
0 ||| ...an unquestionably awful, awful film.
0 ||| Writer-director and Scary Movie vet Craig Mazin's script is so devoid of anything even remotely funny that the movie is more a cheap rip-off of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man franchise than a spoof.
0 ||| There's honestly not a single laugh in the film, unless the mere mention or sight of shit, piss and puke is hilarious to you.
0 ||| This parody film plagiarizes Spider-Man to virtually laughless effect.
0 ||| A Crash-like roundelay of desperately manufactured bathos that covers the entire spectrum of miserable plotting and characterization.
0 ||| One awful 'dramatic' scene follows another, until we become almost awed (wait until you hear Fishburne's chef deliver a metaphorical speech about blueberry cobbler).
0 ||| So, yet again, Hollywood's elite has produced a political tract that plays fast and loose with history from an empty-headed, politically correct perspective.
0 ||| Trade has cojones for trying to lay the kind of political guilt trip it does on us with its sham aesthetics and lurid telenovela-writ-large storyline.
0 ||| Driving Lessons is the type of movie that makes you want to single-handedly dismantle the British film industry.
0 ||| dispicable
0 ||| A hackneyed, melodramatic travesty is certainly to be expected from the cinematic rendering of Neale Donald Walsch's simplistic, best-selling self-help tomes.
0 ||| God, if you exist, why do you keep letting morons like Walsch get rich?
0 ||| The cinematography has all the flair and depth of your average episode of "Yes, Dear"; the score is a giggle-inducing juggernaut of obviousness; Eric DelaBarre's script contains virtually no believable dialogue; and Stephen Simons' direction carries the s
0 ||| Screenwriters Todd Komarnicki and Jon Bokenkamp provide a script with enough foreseeable twists and turns that, if it were an actual road, a blind person wouldn't have any difficulty handling it.
0 ||| An artifact from an alternate universe where Halle Berry and Bruce Willis star in 'Basic Instinct' rip-offs for Roger Corman's New Horizons Home Video company.
0 ||| A typical episode of Law and Order is less ridden with cliché (which is saying something, given that the series is about as formulaic as it gets) and more satisfying.
0 ||| Perfect Stranger is an offensively slick and soulless piece of Hollywwod crap. A movie filled with scuzzy people doing scuzzy things, there is not one person to care about.
0 ||| A perfect stinker!
0 ||| Let's say you have this beautiful blue Tiffany's box. And you throw in a week-old banana peel, an apple core and some week-old Romaine. Then you buy a spiffy card to go with the gorgeous container. Would you then have a gift? Or garbage? I'd say it's garb
0 ||| Perfect Stranger makes a fatal mistake that too many modern-day thrillers make: it so desperately wants to fool you with its plot twists that it ends up playing unfairly.
0 ||| It's a disgusting film that obviously should have been rated NC-17 for its obnoxious level of gross and excessive violence. ... But, even if the movie were properly rated, it would still be absolutely awful.
0 ||| so lifeless and bland you will only see it when Transformers is sold out and your girlfriend thinks that Jim guy from The Office is cute.
0 ||| There's bad, there's awful and there's horrible, and then somewhere beyond that, in its own Kingdom of Lousy -- where all the milk curdles and the jokes aren't funny -- is License to Wed.
0 ||| Sometimes I wonder what really goes on in the offices of studio executives.
0 ||| If for any reason your wife or girlfriend - or both - try to drag you to this thing, break up with them instead. It would be less painful.
0 ||| This assaultively unappealing 'romantic comedy' could well mark the opening salvo in a whole new Hollywood campaign against movie piracy. Anybody who'd steal this dud would stink just from carrying it around.
0 ||| Looks like Robin Williams has replaced Cuba Gooding, Jr. as the kiss of death on the set of any comedy.
0 ||| Somewhere, Rainn Wilson is smiling to himself.That's because, unlike some of the rest of John Krasinski's castmates from "The Office," he wasn't involved in "License to Wed," a wretched excuse for a romantic comedy.
0 ||| All this witless tastelessness is headed toward happiness for all concerned. Their happiness will not equal yours when you see the credits finally rolling.
0 ||| This bewilderingly bone-headed movie convinces that Ben and Sadie, should be kept as far apart as possible, if only to prevent them from breeding the kind of morons who would see nothing wrong with a movie such as Licence To Wed - or worse still, make it.
0 ||| There is more plot in the average Geico commercial, so the movie pads itself with detours into sketch ideas that don't develop past the basic concept.
0 ||| Don't make the mistake of misreading this mean-spirited production as a kid-friendly Christmas flick.
0 ||| torture porn for the arthouse crowd
0 ||| This isn't a movie, it's a thesis.
0 ||| A disturbing headscratcher likely to leave an audience feeling more abused than entertained.
0 ||| Austen wrote six novels and The Jane Austen Book Club is about six people who meet to discuss them over the course of six months. 666. Coincidence? I think not.
0 ||| Look-at-me-I'm-a-filmmaker photography, pacing that has all the thrills of waiting in line at the post office and an utterly predictable plot combine to make the movie even worse than the hacky chick revenge fantasy now showing on channel 186 of your box.
0 ||| Kind of Hoosiers: Part 2. But the storytelling is so backassward that it's impossible to care about any of the characters or really engage in the movie whatsoever.
0 ||| If this isn't the most irritating film I've seen this year, it's close. No, I take that back. It is the most irritating film I've seen all year.
0 ||| A dreadfully misguided movie whose story of redemption is utterly irredeemable.
0 ||| In talented hands, this might have the makings of a good comedy...As it is, it is one of the worst films I've had to endure this year, and that's saying a lot.
0 ||| For adults, it's like being hit over the head with a mallet every 10 seconds for 90 minutes. Two days later, I still had a headache.
0 ||| Honestly, this awful little movie should have stayed in the closet.
0 ||| Tiresome and turgid, Broken has nothing to say and says it slowly. Even the sex scenes are a bore.
0 ||| A relentless eyesore -- like looking into the sky and having sand poured into your eyes.
0 ||| Mad Money opens with the sight of an enormous pile of hundred dollar bills, and that's roughly what it would take to make me once again sit through this dim-witted caper.
0 ||| Save your money so you don't get mad that you spent it on this.
0 ||| Ultimately even the star of Cronenberg's Crash can't salvage what is essentially a substandard rip-off of The Amityville Horror.
0 ||| Open the medicine cabinet door, nothing is in the mirror, close the door and there is--place your check mark here--the demon, monster, psychopathic killer.
0 ||| Crowe, who spends the movie trudging along ... and waxing lyrical about pain and pleasure, must be hoping no one sees this mawkish blunder. He will probably get his wish.
0 ||| This is a terrible movie with barely concealed contempt for its audience. Please don't go to see it - or another of these calamities may be along next summer.
0 ||| Didn't President Obama put a ban on this sort of torture?
0 ||| ..this means that if Jackson hasn't left his scrotum in a shoebox somewhere, he's doing a pretty good imitation of someone who has.
0 ||| An awkward, phony melodrama you don't need to be homophobic to hate.
0 ||| There's something wrong with Kevin Smith.
0 ||| Eva looks like one of those creatures from I Am Legend and distracts you from the story. That might have been the plan, and a blessing
0 ||| Over Her Dead Body is to romantic comedy what Spam is to meat. But at least with Spam, you get cool packaging.
0 ||| It's marketed as a supernatural romantic comedy. The problem is that it's neither very romantic, nor comedic -- and things aren't appreciably better on the supernatural front.
0 ||| Bizarrely charmless and misconceived from start to finish, it represents yet another nail hammered into the coffin of Eddie Murphy's career.
0 ||| [Murphy] continues to treat his career like it were a game of limbo, as Imagine That sees the once gifted comedian stoop to a horrendous new low.
0 ||| Ricky Gervais is such an unlikable misanthrope that this clumsy attempt at a redemptive comedy is as antipathetic as Gervais.
0 ||| The nadir of homophobic frat-boy humor.
0 ||| It's difficult to laugh when you're choking back vomit.
0 ||| Crass, ugly and mean-spirited, 'College' is so lowbrow that it makes 'Porky's' look like 'Casablanca.'
0 ||| Things never get better than the movie's poster, which features a kid with his head in a toilet. Incidentally, that image doubles, concisely, as apt film criticism.
0 ||| Excruciatingly unfunny.
0 ||| One of the most incoherent, boring, useless films I have ever seen and I pray to God that you guys never subject yourself to it.
0 ||| One very tiny part racetrack-caper-movie, and nine parts lethargy, it is wrong in every way.
0 ||| Deal has to take the title of the worst film ever about the game and that includes the how-to videos with Joan Rivers impersonators you see in your Vegas hotel room.
0 ||| There is more complexity in a sub-par episode of the Teletubbies than in anything to be found in Deal
0 ||| There is so little originality here and so much faking it that it hardly justifies critical analysis.
0 ||| Will likely make its own mark on history as the single most relentlessly self-conscious vanity project to ever be conceived.
0 ||| Visually ugly, morally non-existent and a complete black hole in the departments of insight and wit, Chapter 27 is quite possibly the most godawful, irredeemable film to yet emerge in the 21st century.
0 ||| Chapter 27 just makes you feel bad for, and about, everybody -- including the wretched souls who made the thing.
0 ||| No Step Brotherly love here...He [Farrell]gets not funnier with each succeeding movie.
0 ||| Some are touting this as the grown-up version of Superbad. Wrong. That earlier film was excellent. "Super bad," as applied to Step Brothers, is a super understatement.
0 ||| Totally bereft of humor, an insult to the intelligence of anyone over the age of reason, reprehensibly crude, this is worse than stupid.
0 ||| With exhibitionist Will Ferrell finding another excuse to expose himself in a movie, he's leaving himself in danger of going down in cinematic history as the man who nude too much.
0 ||| Heightened suspicions of the decline of civilization became inescapable this past Friday when Adam McKay's Step Brothers oozed its way into theaters.
0 ||| I can't urge you enough to stay as far away as possible. The swarms of young girls watching this phenomenon opening weekend will eat you alive.
0 ||| Would that Joe Johnston's The Wolfman were spectacularly awful, then it would have been at least a fun time at the movies.
0 ||| The only thing scary about Joe Johnston's The Wolfman is that it exists. The fact that people, nay professionals, spent several years working on this picture genuinely upsets me.
0 ||| If there's a Southern-gothic clich (oh, those snakes!) that writer-director Deborah Kampmeier misses, I don't know it.
0 ||| The whole distasteful mess is sunk up to its neck in a brew of Southern Gothic atmosphere and hocus-pocus sentimentality.
0 ||| This is as stupid, hollow, and irresponsible a movie as any I've seen, and I've seen Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS.
0 ||| A molasses-paced flick which rings false from beginning to end, from its patently absurd premise clear through to its unintentionally funny resolution.
0 ||| I have seen many execrable films -- Plan 9 From Outer Space, Disaster Movie, Batman & Robin -- but never has a movie made me so physically ill.
0 ||| Alex Aja has not only made the worst film of his career in Mirrors, he's made possibly the worst film of the year.
0 ||| Even the most forgiving fans of supernatural horror will balk at Mirrors' cookie-cutter characterizations, predictable shocks, and ridiculous, punishing plot.
0 ||| If bloody mayhem is your idea of fun, this movie could cause you to explode in joy.
0 ||| Ninja Assassin, awash in a veritable flood of patently fake CG blood - some of which ends up bespotting the "camera," no less - feels like getting stuck on Level 1 of the 1992 beta version Mortal Kombat for two hours.
0 ||| For a film about silent assassins, it's phenomenally noisy. But if you're into swearing, decapitation and sliced-off limbs, and your brain has been reduced to mush by sitting in front of violent video games, this is the movie for you.
0 ||| There's something almost pathetic about a movie this useless; you could feel sorry for it if it weren't such an unholy torture to sit through.
0 ||| If comedy is all timing, then I Love You Beth Cooper is temporally retarded.
0 ||| A film so badly executed that you have to wonder if Larry Doyle (who serves as screenwriter) ever read his own book, let alone wrote it.
0 ||| Does Chris Columbus owe somebody a favor?
0 ||| Here's the bottom line: Denis Cooverman might love Beth Cooper. But I don't.
0 ||| This is the worst version of Can't Hardly Wait imaginable. Denis shouldn't hang out with Beth. Beth shouldn't give Denis the time of day.
0 ||| Most of the characters are one-sided and boring and the actors who play them are so bad the movie suffers for it.
0 ||| The movie is cringe-worthy when trying to be humorous, and laughable when it attempts belatedly to make us care about these characters with the depth and humanity of wet cardboard. I hate you, pathetic high school movie.
0 ||| Glumly self-serious, harmfully sanitized to a PG-13 rating, and absent of any detectable personality at all.
0 ||| An absolutely abysmal crime flick.
0 ||| Considering the best thing here is a joke about Billy Crystal letting his freak flag fly, it's painfully apparent there's just no rehabilitating this stinker.
0 ||| Another excruciating film about an unlikable hero who is somehow considered a badass despite making jokes like, 'You can't handle the tooth.'
0 ||| They never elevate Tooth Fairy above bland and predictable, which is a horrifying fact given you have two of the most charming and beloved screen stars of all time in the movie (Julie Andrews and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson).
0 ||| No one comes out of Tooth Fairy smelling minty-fresh, but Judd especially is ill-served by a girlfriend role that forces the actress to switch moods every five minutes to suit the plot.
0 ||| Its rage against the U.S. war machine is not only five years too late, but simplistic, its censure screamed with all the subtlety of Shock and Awe and its schematic layout of good and evil.
0 ||| Will appeal only to Anglophiles who swoon at the sound of such words as 'codswallop'...
0 ||| Last House on the Left is so stomach-churningly anti-human it makes you wonder why Goldwyn...and Potter signed on.
0 ||| A shockingly mundane disappointment taken on its own and a deeply misguided refraction of the original.
0 ||| The movie means to be about how violence makes animals out of all of us, including the vengeful parents. Unfortunately, that also includes the audience.
0 ||| Even on the level of killer-virus-gone-wild gore-fest, The Crazies as rejiggered by Eisner is a dud.
0 ||| They're mere imitations. There's nothing beneath the surface similarities and programmed franticness.
0 ||| All three leads are adequate, but the simple act of attempting to re-create the madcap aura of the original Stooges' brotherly sadomasochism is doomed from the get-go.
0 ||| Ultimately, you aren't watching THE Three Stooges. You are watching three guys do an impression of THE Three Stooges. It's like Nickelback doing a cover of a Beatles song.
0 ||| What this childish wallow was doing in the Dramatic Competition at Sundance only Robert Redford's minions know.
0 ||| the worst kind of dreck
0 ||| I'm probably not the first to say it's a train wreck. Starts out good enough, shows ability to the 1/2way mark, but the last 30 mins are just a scripting mess.
0 ||| I hope Jay-Z doesn't add me to his hit list for saying this, right below Chris Brown, but his wife can't act worth a damn when she doesn't get to sing.
0 ||| Don't look for hot sex or boiled bunnies in Obsessed, a mild-mannered version of Fatal Attraction that seems to be hoping racial politics will fill in for a script.
0 ||| I'd call this stenchcloud 'Fatal Attraction meets The Temp,' but that would insult those movies.
0 ||| I went into the movie ambivalent about him, but after hearing his hate-fuled, unself-aware rants, I shifted to the 'can't stand him' camp.
0 ||| A thoroughly repulsive science fiction-horror flick that slicks up its B-movie tawdriness with high-gloss production values and two otherwise classy stars.
0 ||| Who would have thought talent of that calibre would combine to create such a catastrophic stinker.
0 ||| Poorly-acted, bland, overlong and thrill-less. It insults your intelligence from start to finish.
0 ||| Everything that could and should be elaborated at length to make for a convincing or even just passably trashy love story is glossed over here just as much as in the last two Twilight movies.
0 ||| This wretched thing should have been snuffed out at the drawing board.
0 ||| ...as tedious and interminable an experience as one could possibly envision.
0 ||| Too sadistic, violent, and grossly offensive, there are some movies that never should have been made, even for art-house audiences.
0 ||| This woman-hating, audience-baiting, nerve-grating tripe gets off to a rancid start, and then just rots away before your very eyes for 104 stupefying minutes.
0 ||| Despite positioning itself as a Napoleon Dynamite-style comedy about a spazzy social retard, Splinterheads seems to have misplaced most of its jokes.
0 ||| Palliative Care: The Movie. Now that's entertainment.
0 ||| There's no arc here, no real pathos, and the direction is like watching snow melt on the side of a road.
0 ||| Slaps, screams, and airborne fire extinguishers thoroughly destroy the film's air of mopey sincerity to bits.
0 ||| Shame on them!
0 ||| [The ending] shamelessly exploits a real-life event, an iconic moment whose heartbreak far eclipses anything this cheap melodrama contrives.
0 ||| "Remember Me" is a movie with an urgent message. The message is: Please consider seeing another movie.
0 ||| [Pattinson is] like Luke Perry doing James Dean in the dreariest John Hughes movie ever made: Some Kind of Terrible.
0 ||| [The lead] character appears to consist solely of his reluctance to shave and his massive cigarette habit that is given more screentime than most of the named characters.
0 ||| I kept expecting Pattinson to scream, 'You're tearing me apart,' or claim that he 'coulda been a contender,' which, unfortunately, he never does.
0 ||| Arrogant in forcing a large-scale weight to a story and characters much too flimsy to deserve, much less support, it.
0 ||| I hate this movie. I hate it a lot.
0 ||| What Goes Up's point that Americans create icons to fulfill their own screwy needs is made through contrived and nonsensical plotting.
0 ||| About as cruddy as a cruddy little indie can get, especially given a cast that should've known better.
0 ||| Institutional racism as inspirational melodrama, it's regressive entertainment, our very own Triumph of the Will.
0 ||| Sing it together with me my brothers, thank the Lawd for he created the white man that he might teach them po' negroes the value of good Christian chariddy.
0 ||| Snicker all you want at the unfortunate title of director Roger Kumble's horrible family film, for that's the only thing funny about it.
0 ||| Brought to you by Participant Media, makers of Food, Inc. and The Cove. Next time, guys, give a hoot and don't pollute the multiplex. Save the children. [Blu-ray]
0 ||| ...it seems the animals have already taken their revenge on any humans unfortunate enough to see this film.
0 ||| So obnoxious, so inept, so vile, so distasteful, and so unfunny it should successfully act as repellent for all viewers outside of humanoid sewer dwellers who have never seen a movie before and may be attracted to the sight of moving images.
0 ||| In its cretinous fashion, Furry Vengeance is almost impressive. Here's a pro-nature, anti-development family comedy that appears to be made by and for people who never leave the mall.
0 ||| The end credits cast sing-along to a cover of 'Insane in the Brain' completes the litany of idiotic filmmaking choices that made the whole thing so unwatchable to begin with.
0 ||| Furry Vengeance is billed as a comedy, but I doubt it'll make you laugh. It might, however, cause you to weep for Brendan Fraser.
0 ||| Furry Vengeance is one of the worst films I have ever seen.
0 ||| There is nothing remotely entertaining, endearing or enjoyable about 'Furry Vengeance,' a ghastly movie that has to be one of the year's worst.
0 ||| an experience in collective embarrassment %u2014 embarrassment for yourself, your fellow audience and the actors onscreen forced to take part in the movie's wildly inept, bottom-of-the-barrel shenanigans.
0 ||| Mind-rottingly reprehensible and vile -- not to mention stupefyingly unfunny and embarrassing.
0 ||| Not a good time. Seriously, really not a good time.
0 ||| Here is a film that doesn't just scrape the bottom of the barrel, it demands that you lick it.
0 ||| That even the kids in the audience didn't really laugh at all the hyperactive mugging and slapsticky animal nonsense pretty much tells you what an excruciating 91-minute endurance test this is.
0 ||| What you won't be able to figure out is why this laughable yarn didn't go straight to DVD.
0 ||| You know the line about what a bear does in the woods? Not only is that wittier than all of Did You Hear About the Morgans?, it describes the movie as well.
0 ||| It's not just the sound of crickets you hear watching this movie. It's the sound of dead crickets.
0 ||| Why isn't there a federal program to protect people from witnessing movies like this?
0 ||| It's as if the film is a no-humour zone, and any attempt at a laugh gets sucked into a cinematic vacuum of mirthlessness.
0 ||| If it wasn't for Hugh Grant, Did You Hear About The Morgans? would be competing for worst comedy of the decade. Instead, it's just in the running for worst comedy of the year.
0 ||| To end my assessment on the level of the film's writing, you'll wish you never heard about the Morgans. (Ha ha ha)
0 ||| There's something seriously wrong when you assemble actors this good -- and can't believe a single stilted word coming out of their mouths.
0 ||| Say what you will about Boaz Yakin's epically awful Death in Love, but it wastes no time letting you know what you're in for.
0 ||| The Collector signals much of what's wrong with torture porn.
0 ||| There is no reason on earth 'The Collector' exists.
0 ||| One trap leaves a woman impaled on a movie screen, producing an image that succinctly if literally sums up a genre's cynicism.
0 ||| Some people's stories are so interesting that a book or a movie adaptation alone simply won't suffice. Sometimes both are needed. Apparently, Rupert Isaacson's is one of them.
0 ||| It's deeply immoral to turn a ten year old girl into The Bride from "Kill Bill" and pretend it's just a cartoon.
0 ||| Casting its south-of-the-border setting as a dingy, nightmarish hellhole of hookers and red neon lights, Not Forgotten is a feature-length anti-tourism campaign for Mexico.
0 ||| Butler and Aniston, earning zero laughs, can't even bicker with any heat; Jessica Simpson and John Mayer would see this (separately) and say, 'You call that resentment?'
0 ||| Someday, The Bounty Hunter and last month's Cop Out will be featured in a cable movie double bill as the two worst 1988 films of 2010.
0 ||| The filmmakers clearly believe that their tangled storyline is madcap and delightful, but each new complication just serves to make us feel as though the blessed end of the movie is creeping further and further away.
0 ||| Strictly by-the-numbers, cookie-cutter, Hollywood production-line crap barely worthy of a legitimate theatrical release.
0 ||| I like Jennifer Aniston, but heaven knows what attracted her to this junk.
0 ||| It's one thing for the leads to not share believable romantic chemistry, and then there's the rather sad and lazy display Aniston and Butler put on here, not even striking believable negative vibes as a divorced couple.
0 ||| Both visually and emotionally ugly from start to finish, this empty crime thriller doesn't have a moment that's genuinely worth watching.
0 ||| A strong early candidate for the most agonisingly tedious film of 2009.
0 ||| Combines the heavy-handed clamminess of unneeded brand remarketing with the hateful hollowness of overdone and empty computer-generated imagery. ... With Burton's uninspired, underdone and underwritten version, you only feel like you're watching money.
0 ||| The movie, based on a comic book, features a couple of actors who deserve better (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Idris Elba) and some who deserve even worse (like Chris Evans).
0 ||| The lack of new ideas might not matter if the puzzles were fresh or entertaining, but they aren't. Director Renny Harlin has made enjoyably daft movies before, including Cliffhanger and The Long Kiss Goodnight, but here he fails to set our pulses racing.
0 ||| It's actually remarkable just how thoroughly and completely 12 Strong manages to alienate the viewer over the course of its punishing 130 minute runtime...
0 ||| God knows, a thirteen-year-old would have more sense. But that age is too sophisticated for dreck like this.
0 ||| ...a thoroughly reprehensible piece of work that deserves every ounce of derision and vitriol thrown its way.
0 ||| This stinker barks. It has been fermenting for a couple of years as the creative minds behind it continued to cut, recut then cut again, trying to make steak out of ground beef.
0 ||| Stupefyingly horrendous.
0 ||| Misses the mark by an entire continent.
0 ||| Alley flasher, pubescent paperboy, toy with a broken squeaker. Edward Burns sounds like those things, but plays none of them here. He's fire marshal Jordy Warsaw. That sounds like a Pauly Shore character; Shore would arguably act with greater conviction.
0 ||| ...this long, boring, convoluted, confusing, feeble, disgraceful film is nothing more than a clumsy Chinese Communist attempt to paint Sun Yat sen, a freedom-lover, as an early Communist.
0 ||| Roland Emmerich provides the next entry in the "Apocalyptically Disastrous" subgenre of mega-blockbuster cinema, following up Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen with an equally soulless depiction of life at the end of the world.
0 ||| Congratulations, John Cusack! You star in the worst movie of the year!
0 ||| An eye-popping, insult to the intelligence strictly for the kiddies and crackpot doomsday enthusiasts.
0 ||| Berlin Alexanderplatz feels like a Saturday afternoon matinee compared to this.
0 ||| [This] unsubstantiated mess isn't much of a movie or a documentary.
0 ||| 2016: Obama's America comes to seem like clownish alarmist speculation taking place in an echo chamber of talking heads.
0 ||| Imagine a blend of Paul Haggis's Crash and Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down and you're close to evoking 211's patchwork garishness.
0 ||| 211... is a shoe-in for worst film of the year, and frankly belongs in the conversation for worst films of the century thus far.
0 ||| If this movie is a hit it will be definitive proof that H. L. Mencken was right: 'Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public.'
0 ||| By the dictates of the boys-will-be-boys party genre, 21 and Over is so tame that it barely manages to even be offensive.
0 ||| All, or at least some, might be forgiven if there were just one likable character or memorable joke.
0 ||| I don't think I've ever seen someone ralph in super-slo-mo while riding a mechanical bull before, so kudos for originality there, I guess.
0 ||| ...yet another movie showing young adults to be immoral, profane, irresponsible dolts lowlighted by a lot of vomiting (in slow motion, no less!)...This could be the worst...
0 ||| With '21 and Over,' Lucas and Moore finally have a chance to demonstrate that they can be as witty as well as sophomoric. I'm still waiting for them to at least start trying.
0 ||| That a drop from John Williams's Jaws score wouldn't be out of place on this film's soundtrack goes to show how tactlessly Paul Greengrass milks tragedy for titillation.
0 ||| ...coarse, anti-intellectual, and extraordinarily unfunny...
0 ||| Might not be Wes Craven's best film, but it's certainly his worst.
0 ||| This film quickly moves to the top of the list of 'Most Purposeless Use of 3D' beating out 'The Last Airbender' and 'Clash of the Titans' with ease.
0 ||| Hands down the worst horror movie of the year, and certainly the worst of Wes Craven's career.
0 ||| This utterly mediocre forget-me-now could've been crafted by any faceless serial director at all.
0 ||| It's talky, schlocky and stalk-y.
0 ||| ...the film not only marks a low point within Craven's career but also within the horror genre itself.
0 ||| What [Wes Craven] wound up with was a witless stab-the-teen time-waster that could be his worst film ever. And considering 2005's wretched Cursed, that's pretty bad.
0 ||| This got its financing due to two lines, one about oral sex and the other about condoms. That accurately sums up the intellectual level of this 96-minute monotony.
0 ||| An example of what can happen when the lowest common denominator meets a director in sulky decline.
0 ||| A contender for the worst movie of 2003.
0 ||| It's far too lazy to explore any new levels of stupidity. It's happy to simply loll around on the surface, recapturing already charted levels of stupidity.
0 ||| I'd go so far as to say that if you really liked this film, you have a career working in fast food to look forward to. Get it? Fast food?
0 ||| The embarrassingly low production value of Bernard Rose's 2 Jacks works symbiotically with the film's botched performances.
0 ||| Whatever your reason for going into 300, I can't imagine leaving it very excited by what you get. I can imagine being excited by the prospect of leaving -- for me, the end credits of 300 rolled up on the screen with the comforting shock of a parole notice
0 ||| A film that takes a shot at redefining shameless for a new generation.
0 ||| It should be banned from theaters on the grounds that anyone unwittingly seeing it is being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.
0 ||| It insulted my intelligence, yes, but I still have some hope for the human race after watching it.
0 ||| Curse-a-my soul This movie couldn't be worse The prints should be delivered from the back of a Hearse
0 ||| ...a tawdry piece of sensationalized, stylistic junk, with barely an iota of accuracy...
0 ||| A movie completely and utterly designed around one special effect repeated over and over and over and over again to the point of cartoonishness.
0 ||| Distasteful and putrid, so disillusioned and amateurish that it can't even be bothered to properly wrap up its loose plot treads. Instead, when it finally hits a brick wall, it simply gives up altogether and ends.
0 ||| Pauline Chan's film is a jumbled mixture of redemptive uplift and genre hijinks.
0 ||| 360 represents the number of times you'll turn to the person next to you and say "oh, you've got to be kidding me!"
0 ||| I don't want to believe a professional writer came up with this stuff.
0 ||| All movies hope to turn a buck, though few of them actually attain this goal (at least, not in any substantial measure). Then there are movies whose only goal is to turn a buck.
0 ||| Worse than the first one. These kids are no Spy Kids.
0 ||| Eyeball-gougingly awful.
0 ||| An infuriatingly-offensive, soft-porn primer on how to treat girls as objects who exist at the disposal of men.
0 ||| 4:44: Last Day on Earth quickly devolves into an absolutely endless piece of work that's rife with laughably avant-garde elements and underdeveloped, one-dimensional characters.
0 ||| Any incremental gains civilization may have made have been wiped out, obliterated without a trace by the fact of this film's existence. It's an affront. An atrocity.
0 ||| 47 Meters Down is a floundering misfire.
0 ||| Insufferably boring, culturally hegemonic, and profoundly ugly.
0 ||| Memo to Hollywood: Find another use for Keanu Reeves.
0 ||| If 5 Days of War is any indication, Renny Harlin is looking to hoist himself up from the bottom of the barrel using the Blood Diamond template.
0 ||| Embarrassingly clumsy.
0 ||| Imagine Tucker Max - the charm and you've got . . . well, Tucker Max, but also Blayne Weaver, the star-writer-director of the indie rom-com "6 Month Rule."
0 ||| By being exceedingly stupid, morally depraved, and dreadfully dull, "6 Underground" pulls off a hat-trick of Very Bad Filmmaking.
0 ||| Given the choice of being stuck in a tomb with spiders for 90 minutes or watching Guardians of the Tomb, I'd choose the tomb.
0 ||| For sheer silliness, nothing in 88 Minutes tops the fact that Witt's English ex-con husband boasts the ridiculously fanciful name Guy LaForge, presumably because "Fakey McMake-Believe" was already taken.
0 ||| Let's start up a collection so Al Pacino doesn't feel the need to take paycheck movies like 88 Minutes
0 ||| Wears its stupidity with pride, like a kid who's super-excited about stuffing pencils up his nose.
0 ||| The script is a confused jumble that director Jon Avnet cannot wrestle into shape.
0 ||| The film 88 Minutes seems to be the shortened title for 88 Minutes of Your Life You'll Never Get Back, or possibly 88 Minutes That Could Be Better Spent Giving Yourself a Series of Paper Cuts.
0 ||| 88 Minutes holds you in a state of acute suspense, keeping you wondering until the very last minute whether this is the worst Al Pacino movie ever made.
0 ||| This slimy, slug-minded mystery thriller starts out dead on arrival and then, like three-day-old fish, gets really bad really fast. And it stays bad, ensnaring its star and every other cast member in its wretched net.
0 ||| What a bore. I guessed the identity of the killer from the character's second appearance, and I'm not that smart.
0 ||| Movies this stupid usually have names like Pauly Shore or Larry the Cable Guy attached, not Al Pacino.
0 ||| Forget the mess 88 Minutes as it only takes five minutes for viewers to recognize a loser.
0 ||| One of the absolutely stupidest mysteries ever to receive studio financing and a legitimate theatrical release in this country.
0 ||| Lord in Heaven, how does stuff like this happen?
0 ||| This is an excruciating "88 Minutes."
0 ||| When they were counting down the 88 minutes, I just kept saying to myself, "oh man, this movie still has 72 minutes left?" "Oh man, this movie has 17 minutes left?" I just couldn't wait to get out of the theatre.
0 ||| I should have walked out after 8 minutes.
0 ||| THE WORST FILM OF THE YEAR.
0 ||| Now that this stupendously inept serial-killer flick has slithered into theaters, the diminutive legend had better clear room in his closet for another cinematic skeleton.
0 ||| The idea of snuff films is presented as so obnoxious that it disgusts even the slimiest porn peddlers.
0 ||| Unsavory and unpleasant: violence against women is not entertainment.
0 ||| Spectacularly misconceived, in which the optics of a substandard disaster movie are discomfortingly applied to this unfathomable tragedy.
0 ||| ...a hopelessly obnoxious piece of work...
0 ||| Straight or gay, viewers will find 9 Dead Gay Guys offensive and unwatchable.
0 ||| If garbage could think, it would look down on 9 Dead Gay Guys as garbage.
0 ||| reimagines a piece-of-shit novel as a piece-of-shit movie
0 ||| The one to beat for worst movie of the year.
0 ||| There's funny and then there's funny, and "A Good Old-Fashioned Orgy" is neither.
0 ||| Chlamydia, gonorrhea and Jason Sudeikis are three reasons to stay well clear of "A Good Old Fashioned Orgy," but they're not the only ones.
0 ||| While sitting in thrall of it, it's only natural for the abused mind to scramble to find reason in an otherwise meaningless entertainment.
0 ||| Clearly aiming to cash in on the (undeserved) success of last year's Bad Moms, this slapdash sequel is even more dispiriting.
0 ||| Calling it a broad comedy would be like fat-shaming an entire genre.
0 ||| I'm sort of amazed that movies like this keep getting made, which makes me the stupid one.
0 ||| A misguided and often intolerable trainwreck...
0 ||| The cinematographer may have gotten some great material for his reel... for the rest of us, it is a two + hour long waste of time.
0 ||| Like opening up a Hallmark card and getting sprayed in the eyes with napalm.
0 ||| Lasse Hallstrm's gooey film exists only to offer comforting reassurances about dogs' natural servility.
0 ||| It might be one of the most cloying and aggressively irritating films that I have ever been subjected to.
0 ||| Whatever a dog's purpose might be, the movie's purpose is clear: to make you smile and say, "Awww." Woof.
0 ||| There is a complete failure of tone in this film, from begining to end.
0 ||| Simon Pegg is a very talented comic actor, but you would never guess that in this claustrophobic, strained stream-of-consciousness, sinking cinematic showboat.
0 ||| Will really test what you consider to be funny. Director Stephan Elliott puts a serious dent in his resume and may have his Australian citizenship revoked as a result.
0 ||| How dismally arch and self-satisfied can a Chelseacore sex comedy get?
0 ||| Do we sympathize with Swann? Not remotely. Do we find his friends interesting? Not at all.
0 ||| The guys play victims and lament the poor condition of being horny guys whose significant others won't just be happy with men who make no effort at all.
0 ||| a Walter Mitty approach to justify the decadent and pathetic life of Charlie Sheen
0 ||| A complete waste of time on every level. Loud, obnoxious, boring, cartoonish, morally reprehensible, and just plain stupid.
0 ||| This is the Magpie School of action filmmaking: Anytime things start to make so little sense that you might lose the audience, just throw something shiny up on screen to distract.
0 ||| The Bowfinger parody of itself.
0 ||| Pushes the series deep into the trash heap
0 ||| The score by Marco Beltrami might suggest a mission impossible, but the movie's reality is more like a poor man's Wile E. Coyote-Road Runner cartoon...
0 ||| Once blithely acceptable as American id, McClane's become the archetypal American idiot. [Blu-ray]
0 ||| ...ends up tedious and redundant.
0 ||| I can't imagine this painfully unfunny and often boring movie being a 'thing' for guys or gals.
0 ||| Mean-spirited, badly made and unfunny is one set of disasters; adding in storytelling incompetence adds to the catastrophe.
0 ||| "A Haunted House" runs a scant 86 minutes, but it's a painful 86 minutes, seeming twice as long and more punishing by the second.
0 ||| If you're wondering why A Haunted House exists alongside the upcoming Scary Movie 5 rather than instead of it, you may already have given the subject more thought than Marlon Wayans had hoped.
0 ||| It's like watching a snuff film, only it's the audience who's dying inside.
0 ||| A movie that offends every moral sensibility but delivers few comedic rewards.
0 ||| I thought coming down with the flu would be the worst thing to happen to me this week. But that was a few days ago when I was still sweating it out in bed and coughing up my lungs... before my immune system was further compromised by A Haunted House.
0 ||| A Haunted House is technically inept, monotonous, and stiflingly cheap-looking. How this cost $2.5 million dollars to produce is beyond me.
0 ||| It becomes apparent after only moments that the filmmakers are once more happy to reach for the lowest common denominator, slapping together an icky non-stop barrage of bodily functions, racial stereotyping and rancid epithets and call it a comedy.
0 ||| A movie for morons that is offensive on so many levels. It is loud, profane and profoundly stupid. One has to question how a film so awful could even be made, it is that bad. Most regrettably, it is not funny, not even a tiny bit.
0 ||| I almost laughed when Wayans pulled out a pair of nunchucks to stupidly battle a swarm of dark moths and nunchucked himself in the nuts.
0 ||| There are almost no redeeming qualities to this movie. It is bad enough to trigger an existential crisis in the heartiest of movie-lovers.
0 ||| Why did I need to see scene after unfunny scene of Wayans nakedly humping a creepy children's doll (there must be 10 minutes of this footage)?
0 ||| A Haunted House 2 is dumber than dumb dumb, which at least has the nerve to be unapologetically dumb. Worse, it's Wayans dumb.
0 ||| Marlon Wayans on his own has taken his family name lower than ever before... even lower than White Chicks.
0 ||| The [A Haunted House] movies are like a strange sort of exorcism: They chase the demons away by having Marlon Wayans scream for 90 minutes [...]
0 ||| There are a couple of laughs to be found in A Haunted House 2.
0 ||| ...an aggressively narrow-minded documentary.
0 ||| Graham Chapman's story, frankly, is better served by his Wikipedia page.
0 ||| The film reaches into the pits of moviegoing hell when it finds Marley on a celestial white couch, ringed in billowing white curtains, communing with God. And God is embodied by Whoopi Goldberg.
0 ||| Sending Marley an escort who is a little person for comic effect represents a major foul; the guy saying people call him 'a little bit of heaven' is hitting the ball backwards out of the stadium.
0 ||| This movie turns into a total bummerfest that isn't sad enough to make me cry or funny enough to make me giggle.
0 ||| Who knew dying could be such a laugh riot? Certainly not any of us who have actually watched a loved one in the awful final stages of cancer.
0 ||| Butchering its Nick Hornby based source material, the end result is an aggravating chore to sit through.
0 ||| What we have here is a failure of craft. [MacFarlane] can't direct action, or even handle scenery well.
0 ||| Stupefying in its unfunniness, arrogance and outright narcissism, A Million Ways to Die in the West is a shoo-in for my Worst of the Year list come December.
0 ||| The worst of the Nightmares. Don't bother turning on to this Elm Street.
0 ||| Something is terribly wrong here.
0 ||| "A Novel Romance" supplies a response to the question, "Is Steve Guttenberg still working?" but leaves unanswered the natural follow-up: "Why?"
0 ||| This could be one of the most awful movies of the year. Then, it gets worse.
0 ||| This might be palatable if it weren't also fraught with leaden direction and horrible acting -- it's a painful thing when William Baldwin's the best actor you've got.
0 ||| I hated just about every agonizing, smug minute of it.
0 ||| [The] film desperately tries to mine sweetness from the banality of life's endgame, but the falseness of its bittersweet storytelling only accentuates the misery.
0 ||| Crap.
0 ||| It is, simply put, an ode to violence, but violence as imagined by 21st-century Hollywood.
0 ||| Only the most masochistic connoisseurs of the truly awful need check it out.
0 ||| Makes The Adventures of Pluto Nash look like Beverly Hills Cop!
0 ||| A waste of stars, scenery, and setup.
0 ||| A Warrior's Heart is so inept at developing itself as a film that it hands in all of its devices to the soundtrack itself and becomes a music video.
0 ||| While I'm generally a sucker for imaginative art direction, the Technicolor gargle of overflorid hues on display here barely sticks to the screen, let alone to the memory.
0 ||| A Wrinkle in Time, by and large, comes off as an interminable bomb that instantly joins the ranks of Hollywood's most prominent misfires.
0 ||| It's hard to get me to dislike anything with Jenny Slate in it, but writer/director Brian Shoaf has pulled it off with stunning efficiency.
0 ||| One sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot.
0 ||| Gaghan ... has thrown every suspenseful clich in the book at this nonsensical story.
0 ||| If you operate under the belief that you can learn as much, maybe even more, from bad movies as you can from good ones, this one is a master class in what not to do.
0 ||| This cavalcade of sophomoric, mean-spirited schlock is an embarrassment, putting to shame all of the exciting, limitless possibilities the horror genre has to offer.
0 ||| Abduction has a lot of problems, but the biggest is the fact that no one gets abducted. Ever.
0 ||| One of the worst films of 2011. The script and editing are so horrific that it made Sigourney Weaver and Alfred Molina, two great actors, look bad. Stay far away!
0 ||| Actual abduction may be preferable to the movie of the same name, but only if your kidnappers don't torture you by forcing you to watch it.
0 ||| This teen chase thriller is loaded with unbelievable plot devices, lame dialogue and yes, a leading man who just can't carry a picture.
0 ||| Abduction is a brilliant action/thriller spoof that had me laughing from start to finish. Unfortunately, it is supposed to be an action/thriller.
0 ||| Everything here is done badly.
0 ||| It takes a lot in order for Jim Belushi to be the best actor in something.
0 ||| Not to sound like a stick in the mud, but Abraham Lincoln was a great and noble man. He deserves better that this.
0 ||| [Bekmambetov's] name above the credits is fair warning; shame on me for not heeding it.
0 ||| It is the best title of the year and will almost certainly be the worst movie.
0 ||| Reminds me of the Star Wars prequels... Vampire powers and limitations seem to work a lot like the Jedi...it depends on what's convenient for the plot at any given moment.
0 ||| Don't let the stupid title dissuade you from seeing "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter." Let the stupid plot, the stupid history, the stupid action scenes, the stupid trivializing of slavery . . .
0 ||| The tension almost immediately leaks out of the narrative once we realize we're watching a found-footage horror movie.
0 ||| Certainly one of the worst movies yet made.
0 ||| The worst film thus far of 2015, and so staggeringly terrible I can't imagine it being beaten to the bottom ... Lord knows how and why anyone agreed to make this script into a projected image, but a projected image is all that it is.
0 ||| ...annoying...hopelessly silly...cannot be taken seriously either as a parody or a satire... commands no involvement whatsoever in either the characters or the story.
0 ||| Absolutely Crapulous.
0 ||| Nothing can save Dolph Lundgren from C-grade hell, digital squibs, and schlocky crime flicks like Acceleration.
0 ||| More disconcerting is the idea put forward that self-indulgence is a substitute for structured education, or, more to the point, that it's a substitute for life.
0 ||| insists silly, different and stupid is funny on its own, instead of being as pathetic as you and I know it to be.
0 ||| So, despite a few early chuckles and a few points for youthful enthusiasm, Accepted is ultimately rejected.
0 ||| A campus comedy that's as dull as bong water, Accepted is like the product of a community college filmmaking class, remedial division.
0 ||| So flimsily constructed that it resembles a middle-school play that's been hastily filmed on an antique camcorder.
0 ||| Accidents Happen quite easily commits the menu of sins that have long dogged Australian films: bad direction, unfocused story, thin characterisation, emotional incoherence and almost no idea what type of film it is supposed to be.
0 ||| There's bad and then there's this.
0 ||| If you've seen the first minute, you've seen it all.
0 ||| An absolute torture test.
0 ||| From the man who would one day give us Kung Pow. Need I say more?
0 ||| Painful to sit through.
0 ||| You could make the same movie using the music of Huey Lewis. And most likely a less embarrassing one.
0 ||| Act of Valor is designed to... fill your heart with patriotic respect ... and completely shut off any part of your brain that may dare to ask bigger questions about what you're watching and why.
0 ||| The befuddled SEAL may not understand why they hate us, but the attitudes perpetuated by Act of Valor might begin to provide a clue.
0 ||| The Navy SEALs deserve better.
0 ||| So, so bad, it's hardly worth mentioning.
0 ||| There is just one laugh, from an alcoholic bear tipping back a can of Schlitz in its snout. This happens in the first two minutes. Johnny Knoxville and company know it's funny, too, because they repeat it 75,283 times -one time for each minute left.
0 ||| An unfunny comedy with lack of soul, story, and stunts which prove pranks can't make a movie without craft and authenticity.
0 ||| A gross, creepy and generally tacky piece of claptrap.
0 ||| It's a cruel and ugly movie, possessing a warped political and philosophical foundation.
0 ||| An unholy union between saccharine holiday sentiment, gross-out comedy, and fourth-rate animation.
0 ||| Schmaltzy and unfunny, Adam Sandler's cartoon about Hanukkah is numbingly bad, Little Nicky bad, 10 Worst List bad.
0 ||| All this is rendered with pedestrian animation, deadly dialogue, and a general air of indifference, as if the whole thing was the result of a late-night bet, or a joke gone horribly wrong.
0 ||| Animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots.
0 ||| If the traditional two-dimensional, cel-painted format of animation really is dying, it's because of films like Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights.
0 ||| Goes on and on to the point of nausea.
0 ||| A sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer.
0 ||| Irritating, boring, gross, silly.
0 ||| An abomination so horrendously bad that it defies description.
0 ||| [T]hat fluttering sound you hear [is] just the critics' goodwill Sandler earned from Punch-Drunk Love flying out the window.
0 ||| Almost as offensive as "Freddy Got Fingered."
0 ||| Eight Crazy Nights is a shallow, crude, mean-spirited and painfully unfunny excursion into lunacy...
0 ||| Unlike Trey Parker, Sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny, not actually exploiting it yourself.
0 ||| Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike, Eight Crazy Nights is a total misfire.
0 ||| it's got all the warmth and charm of the Bataan Death March
0 ||| There aren't enough creative Yiddish insults in the world to adequately express how much I hate Adam Sandler's "Eight Crazy Nights."
0 ||| Lots of luck figuring any of this out before dozing off.
0 ||| it would be offensive if it weren't so clearly an object better pitied or ignored. It's a conversation-starter for idiots, God bless 'em.
0 ||| So both Liz Lemon and Tina Fey got their wish. Except Liz's costs you nothing: the Grizz sitcom isn't real or asking for 100 minutes of your life. Fey's wish resulted in this movie, this dull, terrible, lifeless movie. The one where she talks to a cow.
0 ||| A terminally low-rent and bottom-of-the-barrel endeavor...
0 ||| If there really was a merciful God, the film negatives would have been burnt to a crisp in a freak accident. No such luck.
0 ||| While the film misfires at every level, the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy.
0 ||| So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines.
0 ||| Movie fans, get ready to take off...the other direction.
0 ||| Despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles.
0 ||| It's one of those classically awful movies that you almost have to see to truly appreciate why it well deserves its status as one of the worst movies of all time.
0 ||| Aeon Flux is by far the year's worst movie, a most dubious achievement.
0 ||| Theron is fetching enough in her tight outfits, but utters each line like she just downed a handful of quaaludes.
0 ||| It was so uncomfortable to watch this film, I felt like I was desperately holding back a bout of extreme diarrhea while having dinner with my girlfriend's folks for the first time.
0 ||| A thoroughly awful and unusually incoherent piece of work.
0 ||| Hokey, embarrassing costumer.
0 ||| Rolled out in limited release in the hopes of making some lists--the last and cruellest irony of The Affair of the Necklace is that it will succeed
0 ||| A terrible waste of a cast, script, and my time.
0 ||| Throughout After, the filmmakers crank the trials of the film's Valentino family up to 11, sans irony or subversion.
0 ||| A lost opportunity. [Full review in Spanish]
0 ||| Of such deficient quality that it's unfathomable people will actually pay for a ticket to see this.
0 ||| The art of storytelling is both of distinct narrative interest and personal issue in the latest payload of calcified nonsense from one of modern cinema's oddest would-be auteurs.
0 ||| Summer 2013 has its first bomb, and sadly, it's landed right on Will Smith.
0 ||| The level to which 'After Earth' is a catastrophe is amazing.
0 ||| Nepotism has always been part of the Hollywood firmament, but it's sunk to a new low with Will Smith's vanity vehicle for his 14 year-old son Jaden.
0 ||| The dialogue is platitudinous and delivered in stilted accents. The structure is that of a very dull video game made by someone who once watched The Lord Of The Rings.
0 ||| Stay home. Paint something. Watch it dry. It'll be more rewarding.
0 ||| The memory of After Earth is so painful that I still feel like my eyes are burning.
0 ||| After Image is many thing, but most of all, it's boring.
0 ||| Ultimately, if you want to choke on a narrative that is rife with clichs and devoid of any real moral message then stick After The Ball on, if not, there are surely more productive things you can do... Such as watching paint dry.
0 ||| A moment where Brosnan quietly retracts his fishing pole says volumes about the sadness at the so-to-speak root of this testosterone opera.
0 ||| Jill Soloway's film is dishonest in the way it attempts to mask self-pity as enlightened self-criticism.
0 ||| It's boring, overly gory and ridiculously executed.
0 ||| Illogical, thrown-together claptrap.
0 ||| The John Wayne Gacy of films.
0 ||| If your kid has recently suffered brain damage or undergone a frontal lobotomy, they probably still won't be fooled by this cookie-cutting, lifeless drudge.
0 ||| Agent Cody Banks: Destination Forgotten Screen Character (hopefully!)
0 ||| Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London should have been stopped at customs -- as family entertainment, it constitutes child abuse.
0 ||| May be the dumbest thing associated with Anglo-American intelligence since the sexed-up WMD dossier.
0 ||| A junky, creatively bankrupt rush job of a sequel that has no connection to the original outside of the title character.
0 ||| Deadly - despite good work from Meg Tilly, the film is grotesquely directed and the spiritual debate is sensationalized beyond all reason.
0 ||| I never understood the appeal. The animation is jumpy and flat. The story makes absolutely no sense.
0 ||| ...a movie that happens before it thinks.
0 ||| The Alamo is further, sobering proof that every dog(gerel) has its day and every generation gets the movie it deserves.
0 ||| A few dollars lighter, a few hours closer to death, get a chance to glimpse your own mortality reflected in the dead, shark-eyed glare of another big-budget prestige picture.
0 ||| Shazbot!
0 ||| After wishing I could claw my eyes out through How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and now Alex and Emma...if I never see another Kate Hudson movie it will be too soon.
0 ||| This seriously dull romantic comedy -- an anti-romantic comedy, to be more accurate -- is something of a chore to sit through, with its biggest laugh coming even before its story kicks in.
0 ||| Alex & Emma is so off the mark that it lands in an alternate plane of awfulness.
0 ||| A miserable failure on every count.
0 ||| Alex Cross comes to theaters with the distinct timbre of a merger rather than a singular entertainment.
0 ||| A thriller that cannot be taken seriously. Incompetent on every level.
0 ||| Most of the acting is lifeless, except for Matthew Fox who is hamming it up more than fat guy at a bacon festival
0 ||| It feels almost cruel to laugh at such a blindly stumbling, dunderheaded action-thriller, but you won't be able to help it.
0 ||| It doesn't take a detective to determine it's not the fault of Tyler Perry that 'Alex Cross' is subpar.
0 ||| Boring, empty, anticlimactic, uninspired and bankrupt of humanity.
0 ||| Towards the end of this movie, I wanted to kill Alexander just to get it over with and go home. Even Rosario Dawson's supposedly stunning nudity was over-hyped.
0 ||| As if Stone was trying to one-up the legendary Great himself by going all over the map, he reaches for so much and dies so early.
0 ||| With its rampant homoeroticism, elaborate costumes and jumbled fight choreography, one would assume this is a Joel Schumacher flick not an Oliver Stone production.
0 ||| There's nothing that quite compares to the pain of passing a kidney stone... except perhaps Oliver Stone's Alexander.
0 ||| It is, in a word, boring, and that's the most un-Oliver Stone adjective I can think of.
0 ||| It almost works - until the dream factory intervenes.
0 ||| Law is unconvincing as a rou, the script is juvenile and the directing is bereft of inspiration. I was expecting something dreadful but it wasn't that good.
0 ||| Despite a talented cast and some incredibly rich source material, Alice Through the Looking Glass is little more than an ill-conceived and empty bauble, a candy-coated turd attempting (and failing) to pass as a delicious treat.
0 ||| A sci-fi actioner with the production values of your average porno, "Alien Outpost" spews clichs like a machine gun set on maximum triteness.
0 ||| Alien Trespass won't let our knowledge of the stereotypes it incorporates do the work and make the critique.
0 ||| Quite possibly the worst film of the year...a real stinker.
0 ||| The biggest problems with AvP are the humans.
0 ||| a murky film that looks as though it were shot through several layers of black tulle, where the most frightening thing around is a surfeit of slime
0 ||| 'Whoever Wins...We Lose!' Thank you, Fox, for the truth in your advertising.
0 ||| Without a kinky moment towards the end where it seems like Alexa is going to lay a big wet one on a Predator, there's almost no reason to stay awake.
0 ||| Who is the big winner in Alien Vs. Predator? Everyone who avoids going to see the film.
0 ||| Take a wretched premise. Imagine the worst picture that could be made from it. Then imagine something even worse.
0 ||| According to the production notes on the official website, over 40 ideas were hurled around the offices of Fox. Out of 40 other ideas, this is the one they chose?
0 ||| Joining two previously independent monsters in one film signals the same desperation a sitcom producer feels when he sends his cast to Hawaii for an hour-long "special."
0 ||| Expensive claptrap.
0 ||| Agonizingly lame.
0 ||| Devoid of personality and soul, this hellish Frankenstein monster of processed entertainment product wallows in a stew of borrowed ideas and imagery and does absolutely nothing fresh with them.
0 ||| With a protagonist that nobody could like, admire, or sympathize with, this is one of the worst movies I've ever had to sit through.
0 ||| The only laughs elicited by the film are those of incredulity.
0 ||| Easily the worst movie of the week, month, year, and Bullock's entire career. It is to comedy what leprosy once was to the island of Molokai: a plague best contemplated from many miles away.
0 ||| One is tempted to feel bad for the usually likable Bullock -- who looks fantastic here, we must note -- but she's one of the film's producers, so she can't be too ashamed of herself. I am embarrassed for her, however.
0 ||| A salute to stalkers not recommended for cops, celebrities or anyone else.
0 ||| The film isn't merely unfunny and stupefyingly inane but a depressing waste of money, energy and time, yours included.
0 ||| When Mary tearfully confesses that she wears her red boots because they make her toes "feel like ten friends on a camping trip," the viewer doesn't know whether to explode in laughter or die from the osmosis of Sandra Bullock's own humiliation.
0 ||| Putting a marshmallow on top of a pile of cooked spinach, is still not a dessert. All About Steve is no comedy, and just might be the worst film of 2009.
0 ||| Clueless.
0 ||| Breath-takingly awful in every way.
0 ||| I suspect that this is a film that speaks to those who believe Every Breath You Take is a love song.
0 ||| [An] unwatchable, unbearably unfunny farce in which Sandra Bullock hits the lowest point of her career...
0 ||| I'm not sure who Kim Barker is, or what her credentials are. But she has written two of my least favorite screenplays within the last two years.
0 ||| Irritating and inexcusable, it's a total waste of time and talent.
0 ||| All About Steve is painful, unfunny and easily one of the worst films of 2009.
0 ||| Movies don't get much worse.
0 ||| An unmitigated disaster.
0 ||| Sandra Bullock bulldozes the line between a socially awkward character and an annoying human being in a monstrous turkey that can genuinely make a claim to being the worst film of the year
0 ||| This weirdly unfunny comedy is like Clint Eastwood's Play Misty For Me seen through the eyes of the stalker, and played unsuccessfully for laughs.
0 ||| Let's say you're the kind of person who has a morbid curiosity for films that defy logic, the ones that blow your mind with their badness. Then I can wholeheartedly recommend you see this one.
0 ||| Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy review.
0 ||| Destined to disappoint even the most diehard of Bullock fans.
0 ||| Someone should tell director Kevin Bray that Miami Vice has been cancelled.
0 ||| All Eyez on Me is one of the most useless music biopics ever made-it'll be too confusing for newcomers and too underwhelming for those familiar with the work and the life of rap prophet Tupac Shakur.
0 ||| A hollowly pretentious biopic that's equivalent to talking to the biggest Tupac fan for 140 minutes.
0 ||| ...belying its title, what's true is that very little in this film is true (but) its greatest fault as an entertainment is that it is unremittingly boring and uninvolving.
0 ||| All four characters are obnoxious, self-absorbed Southern California clichs.
0 ||| Imagine "The Graduate" as rewritten by a golden retriever, and you'll have some inkling of the intelligence level in the rom-com "All Relative."
0 ||| Earnest, well-meaning and dreadful.
0 ||| The disastrously hollow All the King's Men forgoes entertainment in favor of trying to cause death by way of crushing boredom.
0 ||| I didn't hate every second of All the King's Men. The film is book-ended by two cool bird's eye shots of the Louisiana State crest...Combined, these symbolic images last about 2-3 minutes. I did, however, hate every other second.
0 ||| Gather 'round and marvel at how little Horner and Zaillian think of their leading man.
0 ||| An annoying movie that, very probably, will end up becoming an anecdotal footnote of the cultural times that we are living. [Full review in Spanish]
0 ||| A horrible, 99-minute stink bomb.
0 ||| An ending so unlikely in that forlorn uplift way that an insulin shot should be offered as part of the DVD's packaging.
0 ||| A camped up ripoff of the Raiders of The Lost Ark and Romancing The Stone movies.
0 ||| A TV movie-grade romantic farce that's practically medieval in its cornball conventionality.
0 ||| If you don't like the word 'penis' but crack up at the use of 'wang,' 'ding dong,' 'wenis' and 'wiener,' this is your movie.
0 ||| Avoid this one like the pox.
0 ||| Peaks with its animated opening credits.
0 ||| A virtually laugh-free comedy that puts a sad end to the woefully lackluster screen career of a talented comic.
0 ||| Chris Farley's last film is also his worst.
0 ||| Perry has his charms as the prissy Chandler on Friends, but he can't generate the big personality required to make that act work on the big screen.
0 ||| ...one of the most phony excuses for comedy ever made.
0 ||| Call me needlessly cruel if you like, but I believe the amount of time, money, and creative capital Hollywood is pouring into unapologetically wretched knockoffs like Almost Heroes justifies -- compels -- the full-nuclear critical response.
0 ||| [A] sorry excuse for a comedy.
0 ||| Those hallmark Farley situations, when he bursts into apoplexy over some challenge or outrage, seem unconvincing here. As for Perry, he doesn't show nearly enough charm or ego to be of interest.
0 ||| Be sure to stay through the closing credits for a tag--not that it's worth it, but I was the only one at my screening who did, and misery loves company.
0 ||| Writer/director Cameron Crowe is trying so very very hard to make a Cameron Crowe movie. However, he forgot the Cameron Crowe magic.
0 ||| Like the characters, we're left waiting for something mythical or spectacular to happen. Unfortunately for Crowe, we'll probably find it in another movie this summer.
0 ||| you need an actor who can make the words SOUND smart, and Reid won't be winning a Nobel Prize anytime soon (she's proof that alcohol kills brain cells ... with a vengeance).
0 ||| Director Uwe Boll (is) a latter-day Ed Wood who fancies himself a cross between action-sytlish John Woo and B-movie horror-ific John Carpenter.
0 ||| as predictable as watching a bag of microwave popcorn pop and as terrifying as a herd of dust bunnies
0 ||| This is jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring, 'I-can't- believe-someone- made-this-crap' badness we're dealing with.
0 ||| Perhaps hoping to be a sort of hybrid Matrix meets Indiana Jones meets Alien, Unfortunately, Alone in the Dark is just a bad movie.
0 ||| On the short list of Worst Movies Ever Made.
0 ||| I laughed. I was bored. I couldn't believe my own eyes.
0 ||| Laughably bad.
0 ||| This horror film, spun off from an old Atari video game, is so inept on every level, you wonder why the distributor didn't release it straight to video, or better, toss it directly into the trash.
0 ||| so far off the scale bad that the only possible reaction is to laugh at it -- and I do mean at it and not with it.
0 ||| Saying Uwe Boll's Alone in the Dark is better than his 2003 American debut House of the Dead is akin to praising syphilis for not being HIV.
0 ||| ...films like 'Battlefield Earth' and 'The Adventures of Pluto Nash' await a film of this magnitude because it gets awfully lonely on the island of misfit movies.
0 ||| The film looks like it was made for $1.05 with its murky cinematography, sloppy special effects, and cheap sets.
0 ||| A film so mind-blowingly horrible that it teeters on the edge of cinematic immortality.
0 ||| The acting is awful and amateurish.
0 ||| A laugh-out-loud turkey.
0 ||| It doesn't even qualify as 'so bad it's good,' although by that standard it does have its moments.
0 ||| Quite possibly one of the worst movies of the decade.
0 ||| Alone in the Dark presents splatter fans with garden-variety gore, and gives action-horror fans loud, unscary special effects rather than genuine suspense or bang.
0 ||| One of the worst movies ever made.
0 ||| horrific and horrible
0 ||| Dear Alone in the Dark, ...It's time for me to start seeing other movies. But I will think of you always, when I sit at the movies, alone in the dark, without you.
0 ||| Chances are, you'll probably find yourself alone in the theater too.
0 ||| Quite possibly the worst of the year. Definiately the worst of the month.
0 ||| Alone in the Dark doesn't even deserve the indignity of going straight-to-video
0 ||| If you find yourself alone in Alone In The Dark, run away as fast as you can. Not because this sci-fi horror movie is scary, but because it is so stupid.
0 ||| If someone recommends you see Alone in the Dark, assume that person hates you or at least dislikes you.
0 ||| Wow. What an aptly named movie.
0 ||| The title is reasonably fitting, since I very nearly was alone in the dark when I saw it.
0 ||| ... 96 minutes of pure torture ...
0 ||| It's just the most inept filmmaking you can catch in theatres right now, or probably all year long.
0 ||| The most entertainment comes from watching Slater and Dorff and trying to figure out who's got the biggest forehead.
0 ||| Has just about everything a snarky bad movie lover could want--that is, except a guy and two robots sitting in the bottom right hand corner.
0 ||| How Uwe Boll manages to scrape together enough investment money to give wing to this type of overblown, amateurish gibberish is truly a mystery of the cosmos...
0 ||| The late Gene Siskel once devised a simple method of measuring a film's worth: 'Is this film more interesting than a documentary of the same actors having lunch?' 'Alone in the Dark' doesn't come close to matching that standard.
0 ||| The horror. The hor-ror!
0 ||| Don't watch Alone in the Dark. Not even as a joke. It's eighty minutes that absolutely no one can give you back. [Full review in Spanish]
0 ||| How do you savage something this pathetic, this completely unbothered by the basic concept of passable composition?
0 ||| It almost seems as though there are whole scenes missing--the ones containing the punchlines, for example.
0 ||| It's an ugly, laughless 3-D cartoon about wolves that is so wussified and stupidified that it'll bore kids and make their adult minders wish they'd done something comparatively interesting, like cleaning the gutters in the rain.
0 ||| Recovering from the Harlequin bathos of The Notebook, writer-director Nick Cassavetes directs this bogus-homeboy scenario as though his street cred depended on it.
0 ||| I truly doubt Hollywood will produce anything this year that bottoms Alpha Dog for offensively bad filmmaking.
0 ||| All the overacting from the white boyz in the hood is nothing compared to the final speech from Sharon Stone, the alpha and omega of bad Hollywood actresses.
0 ||| The worst movie of the year.
0 ||| As predictably intolerable as one might've anticipated...
0 ||| Eighty-seven minutes, the duration of this auditory assault, would be sufficient to slaughter every brain cell and induce blithering idiocy.
0 ||| They die horribly.
0 ||| Ratatouille aside, our children should not be playing with disease-carrying rodents.
0 ||| You usually have to go to an Adam Sandler movie, or the Quad Cinema, to see something as incompetently made as "Alvin and the Chipmunks.''
0 ||| Within 5 minutes, I concluded that no one over the age of 4 could possibly withstand more than 3 minutes of those hideous rodent voices without suffering permanent damage.
0 ||| Set out the rodent traps for this lazy exercise in children's entertainment.
0 ||| Patently, obviously unacceptable on any kind of storytelling level.
0 ||| The only thing The Road Chip accomplishes is making three previous Chipmunk comedies look not as abysmally bad by comparison.
0 ||| Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip has sporadic laughs for the under-10 set and absolutely nothing for the poor parents sitting next to them.
0 ||| It is a loud and bloated live action mixed with animation that will appeal to the less discriminating young ones. I guess in that case it does exactly what it was supposed to, but it is impossible to even mildly recommend something like this.
0 ||| The next time the chipmunks make something together, I hope it's a fur coat.
0 ||| Bashing your head against the wall would be more fun than The Road Chip.
0 ||| The filmmakers play Catherine's disgustingly narcissistic sense of entitlement as endemic to the supposedly girl-next-door charms befitting the film's thoroughly normative gender politics.
0 ||| a boring movie full of mockable dialogue, dreadful acting and long, supposedly poetic narration which could induce a coma if you don't have enough caffeine flowing through your veins.
0 ||| Beholden to the same plethora of taboos, half-truths, and outright lies traded en masse by mainstream conservatism for the last seven years.
0 ||| Is Dinesh D'Souza stupid? This seems like kind of faux-innocent question the far-right columnist and polemicist poses all the time. But the answer honestly isn't clear.
0 ||| "America" would be simply annoying if it were just preaching to the choir; what makes it unendurable is the fact that D'Souza and Sullivan can't craft a sermon that would keep even the choir awake, interested, and entertained.
0 ||| A heinously inflammatory propaganda piece that gives the documentary form and even-minded conservatives bad names, "America: Imagine the World Without Her" boils down to 105 minutes of uneducated ignorance.
0 ||| Trapped in the 1980s, when Chuck Norris ruled the roost of disposable shoot-em-ups. This repulsive macho fantasy seems expressly designed to appeal to the readers of Soldier of Fortune Magazine.
0 ||| What an obscenity. Call it "The Bourne Abortion."
0 ||| There's plenty of talk about American Sins in American Assassin, but none of it changes the fact that the bad guys want to do bad things and must be stopped, so there really isn't much point to all that chatter.
0 ||| American Assassin offers you two competing philosophies that are equally unappetizing: cold-hearted, government-sanctioned professional killing or hot-blooded vigilante professional killing.
0 ||| How on Earth is this from the same guy who gave us L.I.E. and 12 and Holding?
0 ||| If Eli Roth were to direct a Lifetime movie, it might look something like An American Crime.
0 ||| What the hell were they thinking?
0 ||| Someone should call The Ghostbusters to make An American Haunting disappear from movie theaters like a ghost is expelled during an exorcism.
0 ||| There's a dark, abiding mystery at the center of An American Haunting, and it's how on earth major stars such as Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek were talked into appearing in this film.
0 ||| Boggles the mind with how many things it gets wrong.
0 ||| The acting is uniformly dreadful. The level of incompetence in both writing and direction is a scream.
0 ||| There's no escaping the hackneyed plot or Mayfield's conventional hand.
0 ||| Cheap, soft-core porn masquerading as comedy.
0 ||| A slipshod sequel that looks tossed together over a weekend by people who couldn't care less.
0 ||| Sex, drugs and sadistic homicide mark disappointing Sundance buzz-maker.
0 ||| William Shatner, as a pompous professor, is the sole bright spot...
0 ||| Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart were great together in Adventureland, so stay home this weekend and rent that instead.
0 ||| Never trust a movie that has the year it was made incorperated into it's name
0 ||| "claptrap, pure and simple"
0 ||| Let's take a real story and put some Exorcist effect in, yeah that's great
0 ||| When filmmakers leave nothing to the imagination, you're left with the product of their imaginations.
0 ||| In theory, this should all be scary, but it just isn't. You giggle at the B-movie cheesiness of it.
0 ||| When characters are this stupid in a story, it's either a comedy or an insult, for asking viewers to be just as stupid in response.
0 ||| Shoddily made, boring and, most shockingly, without a single decent scare.
0 ||| A sustained if wildly unco-ordinated assault on our senses (our emotions are clearly not on his battle map), complementing those feverish jump cuts with a cliché of equally stunning proportions.
0 ||| Anyone who would enjoy this garbage probably delights in pulling the wings off flies.
0 ||| Anything but a horror except in terms of good storytelling.
0 ||| Begin by blaming leads that lack charisma outside of their model bodies, move on to the cheap technique of pounding soundtrack blasts...arrive at the comically clichéd script.
0 ||| Instead of tension and thrills, there's just a bunch of clichs and an overwhelming sense of dj vu.
0 ||| 3-D, the stamp of greatness...
0 ||| Juri and Secareanu also try to make their budding relationship a kind of possession which threatens to engulf one or both of them, but Garai, who also wrote, just doesn't give them enough of a foundation to truly evoke much of a reaction.
0 ||| A spectacularly bad film -- incompetent, unfunny, ill-conceived, badly executed, lamely written, and acted by people who look trapped in the headlights.
0 ||| The plot is uninteresting, boring and bad. The structure of the film is annoying, repetitive and pretentious. The acting is pretty bad, especially Jackie Chan, who can't act to save his life. The cameos are lame and seem forced.
0 ||| Burn, Eszterhas, burn.
0 ||| Incidentally, it's a bad idea to try bailing out hopelessly flat comedy with outtakes that are funnier than the in-takes manage to be.
0 ||| Burn Hollywood Burn! is one of the most clever bad movies I have seen in my entire life.
0 ||| Burning is too good for such a wretched fiasco; only a surgical nuclear strike could suitably destroy what has to be one of the most enervating comedies ever made.
0 ||| Pity everyone involved with this excessive, ego-driven 'satire' of excess and ego. It's too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this.
0 ||| While it is the liberals of America who receive the brunt of abuse, it is the conservatives, portrayed as hypocritical, narrow-minded hicks and heathens, that unintentionally look like fools.
0 ||| Political humor is a mainstay in this country's conversation about issues that affect us all. But the minute you get preachy is the minute your little satire souffl falls.
0 ||| Forget politics: An American Carol sucks simply because it's ridiculously, painfully unfunny.
0 ||| How dumb does Hollywood think American conservatives are? Not half as dumb as conservative filmmaker David Zucker thinks they are.
0 ||| I can't imagine anyone -- Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, red-state or blue-state, earthling or E.T. -- finding An American Carol anything other than 'not funny.' And idiotic. And demeaning. And aggressively, persistently crummy.
0 ||| Challenging authority as unpatriotic? Bah, humbug!
0 ||| Even if it weren't three years too late to parody Moore (ineptly played by Kevin Farley), Moore's ridiculous tribute to Cuban health care in Sicko is far funnier than anything in this desperately laughless farce from David Zucker.
0 ||| There's a good idea for a movie here: Someone considered poking fun at liberal filmmaker Michael Moore. The only problem with 'An American Carol' is that it's not funny.
0 ||| This movie is seriously unfunny, and it's not just my admittedly left-wing politics that are in the way of my getting the joke.
0 ||| It fails. Miserably.
0 ||| The film is a puzzling mix of sentiment, black humor, and loads and loads of nonsensical behavior.
0 ||| can best be summed up by a line delivered midway by Lopez without the slightest bit of irony: 'This film was supposed to be my big break, and now it's turned into a disaster.'
0 ||| You know exactly what you're getting into when you sit down to watch a movie in which there is not only one but many giant super snakes...Please tell me you know.
0 ||| How many dopes could a big snake squish if a big snake could squish dopes?
0 ||| Doesn't even fall into the 'so bad it's entertaining' category. As unscary, threadbare, and downright dull as these kinds of movies come.
0 ||| A lame contemporary comedy about a radical Dallas commune operating out of a bookstore.
0 ||| The whole exercise has the smug feeling of a Kevin Smith film-- a cameo dumpster that doesn't even have the wit to kill Danny Trejo.
0 ||| Remarkably flavorless and tasteless, which should never be confused for being the same thing.
0 ||| Thirty years to the week after "When Harry Met Sally,'' Rob Reiner directs the excruciating, mawkish and interminable romantic dramedy "And So It Goes'' with shocking ineptitude.
0 ||| Dice Rules is one of the most appalling movies I have ever seen. It could not be more damaging to the career of Andrew Dice Clay if it had been made as a documentary by someone who hated him.
0 ||| No, he does not.
0 ||| To those of us who suffered through his brief moment in the spotlight, it's such a relief to say it: Andrew Dice who?
0 ||| . . . the Andrew Dice Clay concert film, is unlikely to compel its repulsive star to further heights.
0 ||| Why is Gerard Butler still making action movies? Why is there one more ...Has Fallen flick?
0 ||| Angel Has Fallen sucked.
0 ||| The main reason to see this is a charismatic leading performance by Kim Rossi Stuart. Even so, it makes two hours feel like four.
0 ||| Angels Crest opens with the laughter of children at play, but that's the only hint of happiness you'll find in this unflinchingly manipulative and pointless morality play.
0 ||| Anna is also as visually inept as it is dramatically unfathomable.
0 ||| The theatrical artificiality constantly upstages the Tolstoy tragedy, which turns this production into an endlessly annoying experimental film.
0 ||| Useless, completely useless: clumsily made and criminally underwritten.
0 ||| Annabelle's problems are legion but let's start with the bait-and-switch hook that promises a killer doll and instead delivers a shadowy gargoyle.
0 ||| Expect dialogue so stilted, and effects so tacky, that the only scary thing will be the prospect of sitting through the rest of the fiasco as it unfolds.
0 ||| Here's a horror sequel that wants to be anything other than what it is: a picture about an evil doll.
0 ||| This could have just as easily been entitled "UCLA" for all the relevance it has to life at Annapolis. Lin apparently tried to combine "An Officer and a Gentleman" with "From Here to Eternity" and wound up with "Alice in Wonderland."
0 ||| It's difficult to find anything to praise about Annapolis.
0 ||| There's bad and then there's bad and then there's Annie
0 ||| 2014: Annie's America makes director John Huston's elephantine, synthetically charismatic 1982 adaptation look like a Minnelliesque model of focus and concision.
0 ||| Leapin' lizards! The evergreen Broadway musical "Annie'' strays far from its Depression-era roots with truly dismaying results in this crass, charmless, tineared and lead-footed update.
0 ||| It falls ignominiously on its fat one. The Sony hackers, the so-called Guardians of Peace, have leaked the new Annie online so everyone can have free access. It's their cruelest trick to date.
0 ||| Leapin' lizards, was this a bad idea.
0 ||| There is a lot of money up on the screen, from the stars...to the sets, but there's absolutely nothing of worth in the movie.
0 ||| ...it's ultimately clear that Emmerich should stick to the larger-than-life, blockbuster fare with which he's become associated.
0 ||| Regardless of your views on Shakespeare's authorship, Anonymous is an insulting, plodding, dull, unfocused junk heap of a film.
0 ||| I never walk out in the middle of a film, but with Another Day in Paradise, I came pretty darn close.
0 ||| This wretched gaysploitation number is, in fact, the worst gay sequel ever.
0 ||| Rarely has a tale been more thoroughly ugly in every respect, and to no meaningful end.
0 ||| Tasteless and out of touch right down to its foundation, embarrassingly unaware that Crash-like, hyperlink narratives went out with bird-flu paranoia.
0 ||| Will make you hate words--and these idiots who refuse to stop saying them without actually saying anything at all.
0 ||| Ant-Man and the Wasp has another problem: the nonexistence of a charismatic antagonistic character. [Full review in Spanish]
0 ||| Get Jordan Peele to do a substantial rewrite and this could have been one of 2020's best films. As is, it's not worth the effort to watch or of anyone involved in making it.
0 ||| Bruh.
0 ||| Scripted with a subtlety befitting Tinkertoys, directed in a manner that would shame the small-screen union hacks who rap out Xena: Warrior Princess, and acted with the sleepy glumness of a therapy session.
0 ||| A thriller even trilobites encased in rock would find predictable.
0 ||| There's not an original note in Howard Franklin's screenplay or Peter Howitt's direction.
0 ||| This thriller in name only is all too characteristic of the cinematic scrap heap that is the first month of the year.
0 ||| ...a ridiculous and flat-out dumb premise that's employed to terminally underwhelming effect by Cronenberg...
0 ||| So little honesty, so little trace of humanity, that watching it is a little like eating a broken vase, one shard at a time.
0 ||| Unpleasant, pointless, gruesome, and exploitative, Apocalypto is the worst movie of the year.
0 ||| The buzz is wrong. Apocalypto is unquestionably the most reprehensible, brain-dead and offensive movie I've seen all year, and this year has been a doozy.
0 ||| ... Gibson's directorial efforts have been fairly blood-soaked historical exercises -- and Apocalyto isn't just more of the same, it's entirely too much of the same. ... Apocalypto is a career-ending flop, and easily the worst movie of 2006.
0 ||| It's disturbing that we get so much violence on TV and in the real news, that a filmmaker would make a conscious effort to create more of it. This is one of the most sadistic and violent movies I have ever seen.
0 ||| It doesn't take long for the question to arise and to linger, unanswered, over a film that never offers an answer: Why in the world did anyone make this movie?
0 ||| Has no thrills, no chills, no scares and contains a villain, or several of them, actually, that will turn you to stone -- from boredom.
0 ||| What we have here is Conspiracy Theory 101 all Blair-Witched-up.
0 ||| An astonishingly incompetent and interminable piece of work...
0 ||| Quite possibly the worst film I have seen since I have been reviewing movies professionally.
0 ||| Poorly shot, badly timed, lamely idiosyncratic, and annoying.
0 ||| The most unbearable and unwatchable movie experience I've had this year.
0 ||| If George W Bush could prove that Saddam Hussein had funded this movie I would reverse my stance on the Iraq War and say that every single civilian casualty was justified.
0 ||| I honestly feel that the filmmakers and Ted Turner owe me, my family and my future descendants for years to come reparations for this cinematic dog turd.
0 ||| I am sick to death of taking the White Guilt Trip.
0 ||| Grammatically incorrect though it is, Are We Done Yet? is precisely what audiences will be pleading by the ten-minute mark.
0 ||| There's not a whiff of freshness in all of Are We Done Yet?, which goes for the very lowest common denominator in terms of laughs -- and still misses that broad mark 99 3/4 percent of its seemingly interminable running time.
0 ||| the most mechanical kind of moviemaking... Every time you think 'Done' has gone as low as it can go, it manages to sink a little bit further into the septic tank...
0 ||| The female characters on Mad Men are probably the show's strongest asset, but here they're hollow to the point of insult.
0 ||| ...a waste of 100 million dollars and the talent of great actors...
0 ||| This is a tedious, tiresome embarrassment and is without question the worst movie I've seen in two years.
0 ||| Bend does provide some mild chuckles and gorgeous scenes of rock formations, ruins and blazing sunsets, but it isn't very engaging beyond that.
0 ||| Plays like a suicide note: full of references to past glories, past fight scenes played at half-speed, and an implacable patina of obliterating self-pity.
0 ||| It's a misnomer to label the climax of Steven C. Miller's patently sick Arsenal an actual climax.
0 ||| Wretchedly unfunny stuff, and apologies should be issued post haste to any surviving member of the original's cast and crew and the families of those no longer with us.
0 ||| ...a major disappointment, there are more laughs in the two-minute trailer than there are in the 110 minute movie, and what's funny in the trailer isn't funny in the movie.
0 ||| Hollywood in 2011, completely unwilling to make films based on anyone but Christopher Nolan's fresh ideas, goes back to the bar and tries to make that lightning strike twice, 30 years after it luckily struck at all. Guess how it all turned out?
0 ||| A candidate for all time worst sequel.
0 ||| This film never happened. Don't ask me about it again.
0 ||| An animated kiddie comedy that delivers all the wonder you'd expect in a movie about a guy delivering one package.
0 ||| But alas: once our team gets underground, the film turns into an FPS video game, and a poorly built one, at that.
0 ||| Abandon hope all ye who enter here
0 ||| An inflated TV show by a sitcom creator.
0 ||| I know Kar Wai's got a fanbase, but to me he's equivalent to a recent film school graduate using all of the post-production tricks that he's learned, either to show off what he's learned or to cover up his lack of talent.
0 ||| As stale, deluded, and sad as the cot in an old man's flophouse cubicle.
0 ||| Farrell isn't living up to his hype. He's inheriting the mantle from Andy Garcia as the world's oldest promising newcomer.
0 ||| (Towne's) recreation of 1931 Los Angeles is stunning...(but) the movie itself (is) glacially slow and boring.
0 ||| A below-90-minute running time is not even a silver lining to a film that lives up to its name in more ways than one.
0 ||| A pervasively annoying endeavor...
0 ||| An ultra-violent ode to rape culture masquerading as a feminist manifesto.
0 ||| Isaac Florentine's film is maligned with gaping plot holes, terrible expository dialogue, and obvious moments of foreshadowing.
0 ||| It ends up with blurry action that often looks digitally faked and a fractious plot that's stuck over-explaining itself.
0 ||| Assassin's Creed ultimately comes off as one of the worst and most joyless videogame adaptations ever made...
0 ||| The action is barely passable, the look of everything is hopelessly generic, the story is stripped bare and totally uninvolving, there isn't a single memorable or remotely interesting thing going on in it.
0 ||| mock Assault on Precinct 13 for all of its scene-chewing, stinktastic glory or your head will explode in a rage.
0 ||| The value of [Farmer's] dream and its potential for destruction are irrelevant. Refusing to accept defeat is all that matters -- at least if you're the designated good guy.
0 ||| It strains credulity to think that anyone would make a movie that strains credulity like this one. If it isn't the dumbest movie ever made, it's close.
0 ||| Ayn Rand's monumental 1,168-page, 1957 novel gets the low-budget, no-talent treatment and sits there flapping on screen like a bludgeoned seal.
0 ||| Delivers exactly what its credentials suggest -- a clunky, frequently silly, dubiously acted, barely directed TV movie.
0 ||| A talky bore that spends too much time in wood-panelled offices and at chatter-heavy parties that were clearly shot on the cheap.
0 ||| A niche movie on a par with any cheapjack faith-based picture, which is why it resembles one -- and only the most ardently faithful need apply.
0 ||| The film's excruciating unwatchability transcends politics.
0 ||| The Bad Boys II of ****ty propaganda films, morally and aesthetically corrupt yet compulsively watchable in the broad strokes. Somewhere, in heaven, Eisenstein is laughing. Hard.
0 ||| In 1949, when Warner Bros. filmed The Fountainhead, Rand threatened to burn down the studio if they compromised her novel. I'd like to think that if she were alive she'd be looking for lighter fluid for this one.
0 ||| Watching Atomic Blonde is a cinematic crash course. It's a course in how to crash a movie, and a script, and a cast; how to crash them till nothing is left but smoking smithereens.
0 ||| Any man who says he likes this slow-paced, phantasmagorical movie needs a double shot of testosterone.
0 ||| The really frustrating thing about Tomatoes is the toothlessness of its satire.
0 ||| It's surprising this thing ever got released.
0 ||| Watching this painful movie is like having to endure an especially sadistic fraternity hazing.
0 ||| Kirsten Sheridan, who helped write her father Jim Sheridan's overcooked In America (2003), directs this awful drama, so soggy that her previous work looks positively austere.
0 ||| Pandering to the point of offensive.
0 ||| For every brilliant moment (for example, casting Michael Caine as Austin's father), there are wads of blecch barring your finding it.
0 ||| Even the outtakes during the end credits are utterly humorless.
0 ||| The picture is a veritable bouquet of ardent cliches and witless sentiments.
0 ||| I couldn't help rooting for Charlotte's tumor.
0 ||| To sit through this is to suffer the grossest sweaty-palms-on-the-glass sex scene. Funny that the film closes with an overbearing end-credits song by Jennifer Paige - a one-hit wonder who, like "Autumn," is a pop-culture footnote best left forgotten.
0 ||| When this finally ended I had an appreciation for how it feels to be unjustly convicted of a crime...and be released after 10 years when it was discovered you were not guilty. Sure, it feels good to be free, but who's going to give you back your time?
0 ||| Not so much a movie as much as it is a series of blurs and shapes moving quickly across a screen.
0 ||| The problems with the movie are twofold and easy to spot: the acting stinks and you can't understand what's going on.
0 ||| A worse AVP film than the first one just couldn't be made. Except that, impossibly, it has.
0 ||| The obligatory climactic battle is a pathetic letdown.
0 ||| Possibly the worst movie of 2007, and certainly the worst movie ever made featuring the spirits of dying people discussing their futures and sharing mortal flashbacks.
0 ||| I could keep going on about just how bizarrely off kilter A.X.L. is, but it's one of those things that you'll either want to steer clear of forever or just experience it for yourself.
0 ||| A.X.L. is a sloppy, derivative outing, devoid of originality and uninterested in making any real effort.
0 ||| What Axolotl Overkill fails to understand is that the apathy powering its numbly beating heart is actually no longer relevant.
0 ||| Feelbad experiences abound in modern morality play.
0 ||| Don't believe the hype. This is one bad "'Driver."
0 ||| Easily one of the worst films in years.
0 ||| Baby Geniuses is the best argument for stronger child labor laws since the Olsen twins.
0 ||| One way to get through Baby Geniuses is to think about whether it really is the worst movie you've ever seen. Probably not, but pretty darn close.
0 ||| This is a film so completely bankrupt of ideas that the last few minutes are composed entirely of short clips from elsewhere in the film...as if anyone would want to relive this travesty, even in the form of bite-sized none sequiturs.
0 ||| Baby Geniuses doesn't waste any time getting stupid.
0 ||| ..absolute cinematic torture; a maniacal insult to the foundation that humanity is made upon...
0 ||| shares with most of Clark's other films an utter lack of taste and a genuinely ugly look; not only is the movie less funny than a case of diaper rash, it's even less picturesque.
0 ||| The film has a freak-show quality.
0 ||| I'm still clawing out my eyes.
0 ||| One completely unwatchable piece of bottom-feeding dreck.
0 ||| Aesthetically and morally, I can hardly name a more viscerally repugnant family film from the 1990s.
0 ||| ...numbingly unfunny.
0 ||| Even if your children like dinosaurs, don't let them be exposed to the offensive, insensitive, intolerably anti-humanist and racist propagandizing that is draped around them in this film. No plot, no heart, no soul.
0 ||| Seems simply like the aftermath of an artistic apocalypse.
0 ||| Undeniably awful.
0 ||| Who recut it, Stevie Wonder?
0 ||| Whatever happened to Mathieu Kassovitz, the French actor director whose amazing film La Haine made such an impact 13 years ago?
0 ||| I'm ready to forget I ever saw it.
0 ||| Sometimes a movie is so bad it makes me want to go into seclusion and never see another film. Bachelorette is one of those.
0 ||| There isn't a single note in this movie that rings true, resorting to cartoonish portrayals of the pregnant woman stereotype for cheap laughs. When they get really desperate, they cut to a shot of Jennifer Lopez's dog.
0 ||| Husbands, boyfriends, and first-daters are absolutely within their purview to flee in terror to the nearest Michael Bay explodathon when confronted with the grim news that The Back-up Plan is on this evening's romantic menu.
0 ||| Please, ladies, stay away or movies like this will never stop.
0 ||| A disastrous cinematic vehicle that goes so wrong in so many ways it ranks alongside 2009's Sandra Bullock-starring All About Steve in the annals of recent A-list blunders within the genre.
0 ||| Excruciating stuff.
0 ||| The movie they should show the condemned while they ride the ferry crossing the river Styx.
0 ||| Want to see lots of barf scenes? How about tons of references to genitalia? What about several poop-focused jokes?
0 ||| Something is off from the first scene.
0 ||| After the first act, Backtrace turns into a needlessly complicated story where the characters are like carton. [Full Review in Spanish]
0 ||| A movie that tries to make a choo-choo out of "The Sixth Sense" but immediately goes off the rails.
0 ||| Other than the poor CGI and the sleepy performances, there's nothing memorable, which is [Backtrack's] biggest crime.
0 ||| The film may leave you wondering what purpose this franchise serves if not to give expression to Michael Bay's nationalist, racist, and misogynistic instincts.
0 ||| Michael Bay's latest jingoistic fetish film, Bad Boys II, could be the most vile creation to come out of Hollywood since Patch Adams.
0 ||| Bad Boys II isn't just bad -- it's a catastrophic violation of every aspect of cinema that I as a film critic hold dear.
0 ||| A reptilian collage of seething that stands as possibly the most misanthropic, nihilistic, exploitative, hopeless film ever released as a mainstream blockbuster.
0 ||| The cinematic equivalent of toxic waste.
0 ||| Seeing Bad Boys II at the critic's screening was like being in the audience watching Springtime for Hitler on opening night; a torrential downpour of horrific detestation, then laughter so thick at how insanely preposterous it all gets.
0 ||| The nihilism even carries over to the product placement, as when a case of Skyy Vodka prominently appears in the foreground while a club-goer overdoses.
0 ||| Michael Bay, as critics long have suspected, is the devil -- and ... the overblown orgy of gunfire and crumpled cars called Bad Boys II is the spawn of Satan.
0 ||| If Bad Boys II had a secondary title, it would be Hurl Harbor; it's that sickening.
0 ||| I saw this movie on a triple-dog dare. I wish I had opted to wait six months so I could stick my tongue to a flagpole in the freezing cold for an hour. A cinematic fist to the groin.
0 ||| If there are movie theaters in Hell, Bad Boys II is certain to be a perpetual feature.
0 ||| ... So bad that it rockets through the gauntlet of insipidity and tastelessness and emerges on the other side to become good, only to ricochet off the wall of cinematic decency and become bad all over again.
0 ||| The umpteenth summer skinny dip in Jerry Bruckheimer's putrid pond of retread action twaddle.
0 ||| Among [the film's] various low points, it features the worst Anthony Hopkins performance I've seen.
0 ||| The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it. We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce, because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low.
0 ||| Truly awful. Feels like a third-rate parody of Almodovar's work, rather than the genuine article.
0 ||| Huck Botko's film asks us to laugh at, even revel in, the misadventures of womanizing men, even as it condemns them for their behavior.
0 ||| A buddy comedy that reeks like stale underpants.
0 ||| The premise is a whopper of a bad idea, made all the more disheartening by the notion that someone thought highly enough of it to see it as a feasible outlet for movie comedy.
0 ||| Bad Milo! is one bad ass movie-as opposed to a badass one.
0 ||| An almost shockingly bottom-of-the-barrel comedy...
0 ||| I'm not sure why filmmakers think we want to see kids put into dark situations and berated with profanities by Billy Bob Thornton.
0 ||| Manages the amazing feat of seeming to both drag out its material and completely skim over it.
0 ||| Why, Lord, why?
0 ||| Is film in such bad shape that Terry Zwigoff's form of miserable sexual dysfunction is now considered "high dark comedy?"
0 ||| It's a disgrace.
0 ||| If ever there was a movie that should never have been made, "Bad Santa 2" is that movie.
0 ||| Bad Santa 2 is up there with the worst films I've seen in recent years.
0 ||| It takes everything that was fresh and assertive about the original and transforms it into vile, hateful overkill.
0 ||| Bateman's formidable comic instincts really fail him here.
0 ||| This "Baggage" is excess.
0 ||| A tired and manipulative comedy, this new film is one of the most creatively-inert flicks of the year.
0 ||| Honestly, I don't know what to say about this movie, because it feels so phenomenally old-fashioned and outdated, so ridiculously conservative and undermining of female independence.
0 ||| It fundamentally frightens that something so bad could exist
0 ||| A layer cake of cutesy romance, fight-for-your-dreams earnestness and a syrupy score.
0 ||| We live in times where the sensationalism of the provocateurs is more thoroughly accepted in suitable contexts. A movie this grim owes us the courtesy of a steady hand.
0 ||| If you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue, they still wouldn't add up to the time required to boil a four- minute egg.
0 ||| If only Maxwell Smart had been here to foil KAOS yet again - avoid at all costs
0 ||| It hopes to obscure its awfulness with its volume and, failing that, it hopes to dress up its stupidity with backlit shots of a woman communing with a captive manatee.
0 ||| One of the most incompetent big-budget action movies I've ever seen.
0 ||| The reunion scene between Ecks and his wife is seat-squirmingly awful. It's one of the few moments where there isn't an explosion, and where we really could've used one.
0 ||| The film is bad on just about every level.
0 ||| Two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick, and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all.
0 ||| Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever is an ungainly mess, submerged in mayhem, occasionally surfacing for cliches.
0 ||| Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible.
0 ||| Maybe you'll be lucky, and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back.
0 ||| It's dreadful!
0 ||| ... After 90 minutes of mind-numbing explosions, I cheered when a death by electrocution finally broke the monotony.
0 ||| A film which proves 'more' means most certainly 'less' and like a video game its definitely not worth spending more than a few cents on.
0 ||| The backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense.
0 ||| Director Wych Kaosayananda -- or Kaos, to you -- is stupendously inept, unable even to properly light a combat sequence.
0 ||| There are laughs in Balls, but not nearly enough of them.
0 ||| Steer clear of Balls of Fury for as long as you draw breath. Period.
0 ||| crap
0 ||| On some subterranean level, it's a study of how celebrity agents can coerce a talented veteran actor into participating in one of the most painfully unfunny comedies ever made.
0 ||| A severely overrated Allen project. This campy string of unfunny gags does not hold up.
0 ||| One step above a snuff film.
0 ||| Bangkok Dangerous is bad without lifting a finger toward interesting.
0 ||| It's garbage. Cage better be careful. If he keeps this up, he'll wind up just like Val Kilmer doing straight to DVD junk.
0 ||| Robert Townsend's career continues its ongoing descent with this ludicrously awful culture-clash comedy.
0 ||| Jaw-droppingly bad, a movie so misconceived I wonder why anyone involved wanted to make it.
0 ||| I do have some free advise for both Landau and Berry: Fire your agents.
0 ||| A horribly failed satire that should be avoided by all.
0 ||| Apallingly bad. Robert Townsend's attempt at satirizing black culture is far off the mark.
0 ||| The whole film is nothing more than just a tease, not worth the bother.
0 ||| There's something sad about Lee purposely sculpting her breasts to resemble basketballs, then parading around topless or nearly topless for most of the film, while her character is supposed to comically strike a blow for feminism.
0 ||| The most inane and inept hootfest (or, for that matter, hooterfest) to hit the big screen since Showgirls.
0 ||| ...a consistently inept and astonishingly dull actioner...
0 ||| Final verdict: You've seen it all before.
0 ||| Bark is terrible. Terrible, terrible, terrible.
0 ||| A movie this cheerful is destined to be awful to audiences over ten years of age...
0 ||| Other than confusing children, it's hard to know what the inane, tedious, mean-spirited Barnyard is trying to do.
0 ||| Not good enough for even a rental, this 'Barnyard' should be burned for fear of mad cow disease
0 ||| The worst of the Coens' genre-ransacking; mean and self-congratulatory.
0 ||| Degenerates into a tedious series of unamusing and rather forced gross-out gags.
0 ||| An inane, painfully unfunny comedy.
0 ||| The film seemingly exists for only one solid reason: to cruelly play with, and jerk the chain of, every audience member foolish enough to be swindled into a theater showing this pompous joke.
0 ||| Basic is one of those rare movies without even a single redeeming quality.
0 ||| Going to go down in history as not only one of the worst sequels of all time, but also one of the worst films of all time. Come video, it may just have an 'Alan Smithee' credit festooned to its title sequence.
0 ||| Stone's vampy, thumb-on-the-turntable performance is the most hideous bit of creaky past-prime tarting-about since Mae West was dropping the same dusty come-ons.
0 ||| Instead of moving like an enchanting vision of lust, Stone stomps through every scene with the subtlety of a Clydesdale, and her hair looks like it was stolen off a Raggedy Ann doll
0 ||| The laughs to be had in this deliciously awful sequel are all unintentional. A bummer for film buffs, but a ball for fans of the misbegotten.
0 ||| Of all the things Basic Instinct 2 threatened to be -- titillating, cheeky, outrageous -- who would have thought it would turn out boring?
0 ||| At this point, there are inflatable toys that are livelier than Stone, but how can you tell the difference? Basic Instinct 2 is not an erotic thriller. It's taxidermy.
0 ||| Basic Instinct 2 is an obvious attempt to revive a stalled acting career.
0 ||| Praising her [Stone] for flaunting herself is like applauding George Foreman for climbing into another ring or TV commercial whenever someone holds out a paycheck.
0 ||| It is said that the reason there were so many years between the first BASIC INSTINCT and its sequel is that Sharon Stone was waiting for just the right script. . . She didn't wait long enough.
0 ||| Base. Ick. In stink.
0 ||| Sordid and ludicrous, it's a steamy stink-bomb!
0 ||| Another low in Hollywood's descent into virtual flesh-peddling ... Stone proves that she's still basically a "star" only to the extent that she strips.
0 ||| [A] garish, deliciously awful sequel.
0 ||| We actually don't see very much killing at all--except, maybe, that of the careers of Morrissey and Stone.
0 ||| One of the worst films to play Midnight Madness in ages...
0 ||| Danny Baron's film awkwardly melds Bollywood romcom tropes with a half-hearted critique of the GMO industry.
0 ||| Yes, as an Indian critic, I can confirm that Brie Larson's film is unbelievably and insultingly racist.
0 ||| Dreadful unwatchable movie version of the campy Batman television series popular in the 1960s.
0 ||| I found myself thinking horrid, unspeakable thoughts during the screening. Thoughts like, 'come back Joel Schumacher, all is forgiven!' and 'maybe David Hasselhoff's Nick Fury wasn't so bad.' What kind of superhero movie DOES THAT to a man?
0 ||| It's hard to imagine a big-budget film worse than Avengers Age of Ultron or even Gods of Egypt - there, it's been said - but Batman vs Superman has the dubious distinction of showing utter contempt for its audience and wearing that contempt on its sleeve.
0 ||| Granted, the bat/vampire crossover audience might find something here, but only, I think, if they're tremendously bored.
0 ||| No amount of low expectations could truly prepare you for the horror of watching this film.
0 ||| Low-rent horror garbage, and one of those rare theatrical outings that actually deserves to be relegated to the junk bin at video stores across the world.
0 ||| ...uried in clichs and swarms of mutant-like bats who, at a distance, look like nothing more than inkblots with hidden agendas.
0 ||| What an egregiously bad sack of guano this film is. It's so bad that Destination Films is being slapped by a lawsuit from the Bat Anti-Defamation League.
0 ||| Having your own house infested with bats would be more welcome.
0 ||| Grade-A hunk of Ed Wood-level cheese.
0 ||| Sure to remain one of the most spiritless cinematic experiences of the year.
0 ||| Here's a science-fiction film that's an insult to the words "science" and "fiction," and the hyphen in between them. You want to cut it up to clean under your fingernails.
0 ||| Tedious, lazy and thoroughly nauseating with no palpable thrills or excitement to be found. The asinine script and excessive use of shaky-cam will make your eyes and ears bleed simultaneously.
0 ||| It's not a good sign when, at the end of an alien invasion movie, you're disappointed that the aliens have not emerged victorious.
0 ||| The bluntest, cheapest and worst of the 'Apes' movies.
0 ||| What Battle of the Sexes misses is the opportunity to make a movie that isn't a stupid, self-satisfied situation comedy with a "big match" at the end.
0 ||| A dead-in-the-soul cash grab of a movie set in the competitive world of B-boy dancing that thinks clichs, phony melodrama and product placement can substitute for real storytelling and actual characters.
0 ||| The movie's inability to showcase its greatest asset, the grace and control of its dancers, is its most conspicuous failing.
0 ||| Introduce female choreographer. Explore misogyny for 15 seconds. Become uncomfortable with ideas. Disappear female choreographer.
0 ||| 'Cringe-inducing' doesn't even begin to describe it.
0 ||| This hip-hoppy dance-off melodrama is about as funky as an Amish funeral.
0 ||| The leader bares a resemblance to Andy Rooney of 60 Minutes, eyebrows and all. It would have been apropos for him to look into the camera and say, 'Don't you just hate it when you waste money on really stupid movies with cheesy special effects?'
0 ||| It's probably obvious by now that Battlefield Earth is far from cerebral or anything even remotely serious.
0 ||| I hated this movie, and I had a great time doing it.
0 ||| It can stand as the quintessential example of big moviemaking ineptitude.
0 ||| I cannot help but think that maybe [Travolta's] laughing that he was able to sucker people into pouring millions of dollars toward making such an unspeakable waste.
0 ||| It's so unbelievably and egregiously bad, you have to wonder if they did it on purpose.
0 ||| A disaster of epic proportions!
0 ||| Looking back on this film, I can't find anything nice to say about it.
0 ||| Simply put, Battlefield Earth is the worst film I've seen in over 10 years, and believe me, that's saying a lot.
0 ||| Now that it's finally on the screen, we discover that the science-fiction epic Travolta considered a Holy Grail is silly junk.
0 ||| Battlefield Earth bathes in a pool of utter ridiculousness and cheesy visual styles, then stands up expecting everyone to admire it
0 ||| John Travolta and Forest Whitaker do some Hollywood slumming in this tenement of a sci-fi thriller. (10-year-olds may enjoy.)
0 ||| Clearly, at no point did anyone say, "Man, this is a steaming pile of hangover dung - why don't we fix it?"
0 ||| Utterly inane and innocuous in the most harmless, uninteresting way -- the fruit of an overrated star's overblown ego, recklessly indulged by studio excess.
0 ||| finds (Travolta) wobbling around in the highest platform shoes since Elton John and sporting bizarre dreadlocks... the oddest vanity production imaginable, one in which the main attraction is nearly impossible to recognize.
0 ||| AAAAAAAAGHHHH! MY EYES! IT BURNS! IT BURNS!
0 ||| The sets are laughably cheap, and the aliens look like geeks from a Star Trek convention who couldn't afford to buy the "good" Klingon costumes
0 ||| Blame this mess on Travolta.
0 ||| Place it next to The Omega Code and The Omega Code shines.
0 ||| One of the darkest, ugliest, most uninvolving and incomprehensible major-studio fantasies I've ever seen.
0 ||| Battlefield Earth is like taking a bus trip with someone who has needed a bath for a long time. It's not merely bad; it's unpleasant in a hostile way.
0 ||| From any angle this is a very ill-considered project -- an obvious contender for worst film of the year.
0 ||| There are many things to make fun of here.
0 ||| A disaster of a screenplay meeting dreadfully overdone and under-thought filmmaking.
0 ||| Battleship is trash.
0 ||| "Battleship" is the worst humans-fighting-aliens movie I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot of humans-fighting-aliens movies.
0 ||| There's nothing about Battleship that doesn't feel like the conclusion of a hundred lengthy focus group discussions.
0 ||| Taylor Kitsch might be trying to fire his agent as we speak.
0 ||| Epically bad in virtually every way imaginable...
0 ||| Lower what little expectation you have going in and you'll still be disappointed.
0 ||| A beach-slap to anyone with a brain. Embodies everything that is wrong with Hollywood today. It is proudly dumb. It is proudly sexist. It is proudly pointless.
0 ||| Baywatch might've been more watchable if it managed to have a bit more actual fun, not dunce-level antics masquerading as fun.
0 ||| An utter waste of production resources as well as viewers' time and money.
0 ||| This is a movie with no wit, no imagination, and no laughs throughout its two tedious hours.
0 ||| Achieves a level of incompetence rarely seen in modern cinema.
0 ||| ...a film that could only have been excusable had Trey Parker and Matt Stone made it using puppets.
0 ||| The only really interesting thing about this boneheaded film version of Elmore Leonard's [novel] is how flagrantly it trashes the book, and its ... flamboyant incoherence.
0 ||| Let's not go to the videotape.
0 ||| Let's call this what it is: a fetishistic After-School Special complete with closeups of trimmed pubes and squeaky-clean sphincters.
0 ||| Horrible... just horrible.
0 ||| Vile trash.
0 ||| Director Daniel Barnz casts his own spell of bad dialogue, soppy montages, and ringing cell phones as a plot device to ensure that the fairy tale retains no traces of the beautiful or bestial.
0 ||| More than lives up to its name with ultra-campy performances, high-glucose direction (Daniel Barnz), laughable dialogue, cheesy effects and a back-lot simulation of a Manhattan street that wouldn't pass muster on an after-school special.
0 ||| Maybe the next time they tell this story it'll star the cast of Jersey Shore and The Garbage Pail Kids. Why shouldn't it?
0 ||| It's absolutely dreadful, but will appeal to the prejudices of anyone who found Terrence Malick's The Tree Of Life a timeless masterpiece or David Gordon Green's bore-athon George Washington life-affirming.
0 ||| Loathsome as any mindless, blood-drenched Hollywood action-adventure yarn.
0 ||| The results are odious.
0 ||| Beautiful Creatures basically spits in the face of a legacy of literature founded on feelings of exclusion and social alienation.
0 ||| Paramount was wise to release this one in December--just in time for critics to fit the film onto their year-end worst lists.
0 ||| Innocuous, self-centered and disconnected from any parcel of meaningful human experience.
0 ||| Welcome to the rom-com in the age of Must Love Dogs.
0 ||| A gruesome chick flick with a good performance by Mandy Moore and terrific music that has been relegated to the background.
0 ||| [An] obnoxious, headache-inducing horror show.
0 ||| In lieu of plot, it's cluttered with bad driving scenes, dog reaction shots, falling-splat-with-cakes scenes, and watching old movies scenes.
0 ||| Whatever you do, don't go see this movie. Why? Because I said so.
0 ||| It's hard to find a more stalwart movie monster in the last ten years than Keaton, who's gone from a charming neurotic to a cobwebbed, cell-phone-wielding vagina dentata.
0 ||| Treats women like idiots and men like inflatable sex toys.
0 ||| You can put the Disney name on it. You can hire big-time, serious stars for it. You can call it 'family-friendly.' But 'Bedtime Stories' still is garbage, a la Adam Sandler.
0 ||| Has there ever been an uglier animated feature? The eerie, fever-dream-like faux three-dimensionality, the cyborg-like humanoids, the septic, etiolated colors.
0 ||| Artie Lange, Howard Stern's radio sidekick, somehow manages to make beer-league softball seem no fun at all in this extremely lowbrow comedy.
0 ||| Sitting through this film is like spending the night in that sleazy bar you swore you'd never go in, not even to use the bathroom.
0 ||| The inanity is harmless, thoroughly predictable and ultimately disposable.
0 ||| I can't remember a year when there have been as many horrible movies. "Beerfest" is the poster child for them...makes "Talladega Nights" look like Hamlet.
0 ||| My best suggestion for people who insist on going to see this immense waste of time? Go drunk.
0 ||| Sad tale of floundering careers. Poor Judge Reinhold - he must hate himself.
0 ||| I can sum this film up in one sentence: Imagine if a group of people got together and decided to make the worse movie possible based on the premise of the film "Groundhog's Day."
0 ||| It's still reasonably entertaining if efficiently made action films are your bag, though.
0 ||| Perhaps the worst movie ever made.
0 ||| A film that fails to deliver pretty much all the way down the line.
0 ||| This is the remake your grandparents are very very angry about.
0 ||| An idiotic piece of filmmaking.
0 ||| Sandler's latest ode to projectile vomiting, passing gas, gay jokes and physical insults to the groin is basically a feeble cross between The Revenge of the Nerds and The Bad News Bears.
0 ||| If Sandler had avoided the lowest-common-denominator humor, recast the adult ballplayers as kids, and found a decent director, he might have had a worthwhile movie. Oh, wait -- it's already been made. And it's called Bad News Bears.
0 ||| Could it be that this Adam Sandler movie is so atrocious that Sandler himself didn't want to be seen in it?
0 ||| Makes one long for the sophisticated wit of Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo, which should tell you most of what you need to know.
0 ||| If The Benchwarmers were a real ball game, the mercy rule would end the punishment in the first 15 minutes.
0 ||| There's a reason this comedy was not screened for critics. It strikes out, except at Pizza hut which must be thrilled with its product placements.
0 ||| Only the reliably funny Jon Lovitz delivers his lines with any aplomb, providing just a few laughs in this otherwise horrid movie.
0 ||| The Benchwarmers strikes out. Again and again and again.
0 ||| Good intentions aside, the return of writer-director-producer Joe Camp's "Benji" is terminally boring.
0 ||| ...nothing in this boring and inept movie is salvageable.
0 ||| My friend took the 3-D glasses off halfway through, which causes the image to be blurry. I should have tried that. Blurry couldn't have made it worse.
0 ||| The film is so laughably Freudian it could play as a parody of certain acclaimed horror film studies such as Men, Women and Chainsaws: Gender in the Horror Film.
0 ||| Crossing between the worlds of the living and dead is a concept that could populate any number of captivating and nuanced movies, but Between Worlds is not one of them.
0 ||| If you saw Mandy and wished more Nicolas Cage movies were dark, weird, and personal: watch Between Worlds and be careful what you wish for.
0 ||| Pointless, hateful sequel.
0 ||| Made with so little spark, humor, and internal logic.
0 ||| A surprisingly boring comedy.
0 ||| An extremely unfunny vehicle for Chris Farley.
0 ||| "Beware the Gonzo" is a thoroughly amateurish effort at capturing clued-in and smartass teens.
0 ||| You're likely to want to pluck out your eyeballs.
0 ||| The plot involves ... excuse me for a moment, while I laugh uncontrollably at having written the words "the plot involves."
0 ||| This would-be cult classic is the movie equivalent of gazing at a lava lamp for nearly two hours.
0 ||| "Beyond the Reach" fails to achieve the Southwestern noir potency of "No Country for Old Men," but there's no denying it brings to mind another Southwestern classic about malicious pursuit: the Road Runner cartoons.
0 ||| A pathetic spectacle.
0 ||| It's a car wreck, a sideshow. You simply have to watch, there are so many things going so terribly, terribly wrong.
0 ||| Mr. Spacey clearly has an impassioned and intense love for this Bobby Darin biopic, and like a parent, he will be devastated by its sure failure
0 ||| ...nothing but a sappy, shameless, and morbid production that wastes talent and time in a script designed to line the bottom of a bird cage.
0 ||| Sci-fi fans expecting awesome effects and an interesting vision of the future are bound to be disappointed.
0 ||| 2008 has, with one or two exceptions, been a diabolical year for American comedy, and Big Stan hits rock bottom.
0 ||| Trailer park Magnolia: too long, too cutesy, too sure of its own importance, and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all.
0 ||| Has the bounce of a beach ball with a six-inch hole.
0 ||| The picture is thus misogynistic enough to be a Michael Bay film, but it's not nearly as exciting.
0 ||| Sara Foster keeps asking 'Where's the bounce?' when anyone with eyes can see exactly where the bounce is.
0 ||| Wilson's spaced-out surfer style seems to have infected the entire project (or maybe it was Willie's weed).
0 ||| ...they'll be plenty of seats...
0 ||| ...a dead zone of monstrous proportions that warrants nothing but yawns and groans for all 89 minutes it takes up the screen.
0 ||| Um...NO!!!!
0 ||| Worst of all is the way Sandler wants to have it both ways: to muck around in gross-out humor one minute and then turn schmaltzy the next minute with some fraudulent business about how much he loves the kid.
0 ||| Burton had a chance to make a powerful statement on the struggle for a woman to achieve artistic recognition and instead settled for another childlike fairy tale.
0 ||| The sort of movie that hands critics a dagger and invites them to plunge right in.
0 ||| More aptly titled The Big Miss, this grade-Z action parody looks like a second-rate John Woo cast-off ... and feels like something out of Lloyd Kaufman's Big Bag o' Troma Rejects.
0 ||| Somehow Full of It got made and got distributed, despite its nearly fanatical lack of wit or originality.
0 ||| Any goodwill it boasts is terminally suppressed, buried beneath a layer of bulls--- as thick as blubber.
0 ||| Big Momma has laid a gigantic egg.
0 ||| It's a true rubber-necker's delight, a comedy so inconceivably tacky that it will make you question whether or not you're laughing at the film or with it.
0 ||| It's tempting to call Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son a huge waste of talent, but considering the talent involved, that doesn't seem like much of a waste.
0 ||| Oh, come on now! Knock it off!
0 ||| I'm no fan of Perry's blunt-force morality comedies, but at least his pseudo-sainted materfamilias is a real character.
0 ||| Feels constrained by its unshakable predisposition toward actorly fawning.
0 ||| Journalistically dubious, inept and often lethally dull.
0 ||| Would be better titled The Slow and the Sleepy for all the excitement it generates.
0 ||| Billy Madison is a sorry excuse for a movie, and director Davis and star Sandler should be very embarrassed.
0 ||| Billy Madison is a textbook example of a half-decent idea that never got developed beyond the "lying around drinking beer and making jokes with your buddy" stage.
0 ||| America faces the very real prospect that Pauly Shore is the most annoying comic alive.
0 ||| Wanna-be comedy falls way flat.
0 ||| Could possibly be the worst Hollywood movie I've ever seen.
0 ||| It's good for one reason: it killed Pauly Shore's career.
0 ||| Despite the advances humankind has made since dragging itself out of the primordial ooze, Shore is a successful comedian.
0 ||| Shore captured the Razzie award for Worst Male Lead (tied with Tom Arnold) for his performance here.
0 ||| Then there's the acting, uniformly delivered with the flatness of someone who's taken a handful of anti-psychotic medication.
0 ||| Simply foul.
0 ||| Birdemic, which literally has no ending, is actually two totally different movies, linked mostly by their complete, hilarious crapitude.
0 ||| Most people will be bored witless with this piece of bird dropping.
0 ||| It is possible that "Birdemic: Shock and Terror" is one of the worst films ever made ... and that is precisely why it will not be forgotten. [Full review in Spanish]
0 ||| "Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn" is more than horrible. It should not exist.
0 ||| I think Nicole Kidman let the Lenny Kravitz lovin' distract her while reading the script for Birth.
0 ||| Birth is a haphazard discombobulated mess with a major talent drowning in the film's placenta-like goo.
0 ||| How, this far into the 21st century, does a film like this get made? One that shunts Bruce Lee to the status of secondary character in a lazy and boringly familiar star-crossed romance?
0 ||| Black Butterfly's undercooked and incoherent turn of events attempt to stupefy us into mistaking its deeply flawed internal logic for ingenuity.
0 ||| Glen Morgan's disastrous remake smothers terror beneath a blanket of unnecessary information, revealing too much and teasing too little.
0 ||| Oh, how painfully incompetent this movie is.
0 ||| What would Christmas be without the release of a lackluster horror movie?
0 ||| It's one of the least original serial killer flicks of the decade.
0 ||| Shockingly awful in every way imaginable...
0 ||| Neither horror, nor comedy. It's barely even a movie...
0 ||| All setup and no payoff makes this a dull film.
0 ||| ... one of the worst films of the year... again... trying to pass off an after-school special as a slasher film.
0 ||| The worst film of 2019.
0 ||| Black Christmas fails because of its sloppy script, poor production values and total lack of scares.
0 ||| Despite its desperate efforts to justify the homicides, there's nothing remotely innovative or even goofily satirical about it.
0 ||| The Black Dahlia isn't just bad. It's impressively bad. I didn't think they could make a movie this bad.
0 ||| The early Oscar buzz is dead on arrival. You'll be laughing by the end, and not in a good way
0 ||| Words cannot possibly do justice to what a total monstrosity this film is.
0 ||| Most of us come to the shadows of modern noirs to be swept up in the guilt and intrigue, not to be abandoned in the thick of nonsense.
0 ||| Hey, you like 18-wheelers (Have you driven a big Ford lately?), country-and-western music, and an All-American meal (as in meat loaf), then here's a film for you.
0 ||| It almost seems like they made things up as they went along.
0 ||| The filmmakers ... seem to have been inspired mainly by contempt for the audience: everything about their work feels lazy and slapdash.
0 ||| There's precious little to like about the witless and decidedly tedious Black Knight.
0 ||| Martin Lawrence can be hysterically funny. You'd never guess that from watching the remarkably wasteful endeavor.
0 ||| crap
0 ||| The film is devoid of subtext, filled with cardboard stand-ins for contrasting viewpoints on the powder keg of social and political issues facing Nigeria.
0 ||| It's difficult to look past the deadening effect of the clichéd storytelling.
0 ||| Black Out strains to shock and offend, but at this point, 20 years after Pulp Fiction, its conception of transgression is so familiar and toothless that it borders on quaint.
0 ||| the ongoing slaughter is just so much screen time that passes so dully as to qualify as audience torture worse than anything these characters suffer, and their suffering involves a chainsaw at one point
0 ||| ...the film ultimately feels much, much longer than its 103 minutes.
0 ||| Boring and bloated, it's as if some conglomerate of agents and execs and international moneymen changed the programming and language of Michael Mann with the hope that he might be Michael Bay.
0 ||| One of the most visually unattractive movies I've ever seen.
0 ||| [Mann's] closeup work on the characters themselves is shaky, perhaps in the hope that we won't notice they're made of cardboard.
0 ||| "Blackhat" is perfect if you're suffering from insomnia.
0 ||| It's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring.
0 ||| No one's lifeblood is at stake, but the movie's pitiful victims will find themselves out the price of a movie ticket and nearly two hours of their lives that they will never get back. And let's not forget the price of popcorn and parking.
0 ||| 'Blade: Trinity' is a joyless and unimaginative movie with lots of broken glass and strobe lights to mask the lack of exciting action.
0 ||| Snipes reprises the lead role and is even stiffer and more robotic that he was in the earlier films.
0 ||| Avoid this film at all costs. If you later find that any of your friends or family actually liked this movie, then we suggest you disassociate yourself from them, and avoid them at all costs too, as they will only disappoint you somewhere down the line.
0 ||| Blair Witch is nothing but a pale imitation of The Blair Witch Project -- void of all creativity and originality. It's so bad, it manages what should have been impossible and is far worse than Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2.
0 ||| Though it stays true to the spirit of the original, Blair Witch lacks the novelty and ingenuity that disguised many of its predecessor's flaws. It's probably time for the Blair Witch to move to the suburbs and settle down.
0 ||| Can I instead Blame it on Mark Herman?
0 ||| Blankman's use of the cheesy effects from the Batman TV show, including Polito trying to imitate The Penguin, was initially a good idea but the execution is simply horrible and this is what winds up ruining the film.
0 ||| This isn't the worst superhero parody ever created, it's just one of them.
0 ||| Almost entirely devoid of positive attributes...
0 ||| The quality of Chan's recent films has varied wildly, and with this one he hits a new low in terms of the nonsensical garbage he is willing to put his name to.
0 ||| Sandler spits in your face and calls it a kiss.
0 ||| Where's the diarrhea? I was led to believe there'd be diarrhea.
0 ||| Want to help pay for a multi-millionaire's family vacation? Then buy a ticket to 'Blended' and help Adam Sandler.
0 ||| Hasn't Africa suffered enough?
0 ||| Avoid "Blended" like it's your job - because it is. Your future happiness could depend on it.
0 ||| Shamelessly earnest and absurdly shallow ... tiptoes around questions of faith and runs away from any incident that might push someone in the other direction.
0 ||| The scariest thing about this hokey bombast is that it got made in the first place.
0 ||| There's an old saying: Bless the Child, spare the Audience. And you'd wished the producers thought about this before spending millions on this lame turkey.
0 ||| I kept thinking Jay and Silent Bob would pop out and make a Star Wars joke.
0 ||| Winning an Oscar has changed Kim Basinger, and not in a good way.
0 ||| A pox on the house of all involved.
0 ||| An excruciatingly silly script, clunky editing, and an overbearing orchestral score help make Bless the Child something to avoid at all costs.
0 ||| Blood and Chocolate is an unmitigated triumph: it's successfully carved out a cozy niche in the hallowed halls of ineptitude.
0 ||| All things considered, a more appropriate title would have been Oil and Water.
0 ||| This is the kind of werewolf flick that seems to have used up its entire special-effects budget on canine contact lenses.
0 ||| Anyone going to a PG-13 horror film called Blood and Chocolate thinking that it's going to be good has serious reality issues.
0 ||| A truly laughable movie, one that takes itself far too seriously without ever taking a moment to consider who its audience is -- or if it even has one.
0 ||| Less pleasurable than the throbbing bladder pain begat by too much movie theater soda, BloodRayne ably continues Uwe Boll's indisputable reign as the worst filmmaker on the planet.
0 ||| I'm not sure what Boll sees when he looks through the director's lens while filming each of his pictures, but I'm certain it's something different than what the rest of us see. BloodRayne poses no threat to his reputation.
0 ||| Uwe Boll is such a bad director that it must be intentional.
0 ||| When on-line petitions beg directors to stop making films, is that the beginning of the end?
0 ||| Only as bad as ordinary bad films and not as bad as getting your eyelid caught on a nail.
0 ||| It's a pretzel without a twist, or Groundhog Day meets a bad Alien sequel...
0 ||| Incoherent action sequences and strained sci-fi woo-woo can't save a clueless mashup of Robocop, The Matrix, and Captain America that makes a mockery of its protagonist. Deeply terrible.
0 ||| The Blue Iguana is as close to a no-brainer as you can get, and still have anything left on the screen at all. It's a smart-aleck parody of private-eye movies, but it knows as little about private eyes as it does about parodies, and movies.
0 ||| Ugh! Ah! Make it stop!!!
0 ||| The Blue Lagoon is the dumbest movie of the year.
0 ||| This micro-budgeted indie tries to appeal to everyone by not offending anyone... except those who like movies.
0 ||| So bad it must be a Badham picture.
0 ||| An execrable mess and a gobsmacking horror show in all the wrong ways.
0 ||| Maybe the entire Blumhouse production team played truth or dare in the abandoned monastery and this movie was what they were forced to make by the curse laid upon them.
0 ||| Infinitely small, petty, cruel; appallingly sociopathic even grading on the dumpster-fire-horror-flick curve. But forget the supernatural element: the human 'drama' is the most ridiculous thing here.
0 ||| Precious little craft or care is involved, and even less logic. Subtlety is clearly not director Jeff Wadlow's strong suit.
0 ||| Its fundamental lack of faith in its own story only becomes more and more obvious as the movie goes on.
0 ||| It's offensive to gays and straights and everyone else with a brain.
0 ||| A gay-themed movie aimed squarely and exclusively at stupid straight people.
0 ||| Quick--someone find an iceberg!
0 ||| A lame, gender-mixed, mistaken-identity, cross-dressing comedy.
0 ||| If there was ever a cinematic vessel that deserved hitting an iceberg and sinking before it hit theaters and subjected viewers to one of the worst comedies in years, if not decades, this is it.
0 ||| Only once during the 95 minutes of Boat Trip did I laugh, and that was in response to my own joke while writing the review of this pathetic loser of a film.
0 ||| This is a movie made for nobody, about nothing.
0 ||| Plenty of cheesecake and beefcake are served up, although after you've seen Jerry vomit on his fiancee... no one will have much of an appetite.
0 ||| A puerile comedy so appalling and unfunny, it's like contracting the Norwalk virus at sea. Twice.
0 ||| "Boat Trip" should be towed away on a garbage scow.
0 ||| The best I can say of this sinking ship is that it's an equal opportunity offender: there's something here to infuriate you whether you're a heterosexual, homosexual, black, white, Hispanic, Swedish, Swiss, aristocrat, Joe Sixpack, disco diva, war veteran
0 ||| If Boat Trip were a skin disease, you'd have whatever limb it was found on amputated at the base.
0 ||| No one comes off worse than Cuba Gooding, Jr., whom the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences could sue for defamation had the movie's advertisements put 'Academy Award winner' before his name.
0 ||| [Gooding's] performance here isn't as energetic as it is desperate.
0 ||| Even the unrated version should be lost at sea.
0 ||| An aggressively unwatchable comedy...
0 ||| Less movie than fawning infomercial.
0 ||| I've seen comedies with fewer laughs than Body of Evidence, and this is a movie that isn't even trying to be funny.
0 ||| You know how sometimes something can be so bad that it's almost good? Well, that's more or less the case here, with stress on the word "less."
0 ||| Tries hard to be hot and steamy but ends up being lifeless and laughable.
0 ||| Awful performances, idiotic social commentary and one of the worse Rashoman narratives ever take away the pleasures of some raunchy sex scenes.
0 ||| The director is no Vadim and the star is no Bardot.
0 ||| The real future of Bolero is in home cassette rentals, where your fast forward and instant replay controls will supply the editing job the movie so desperately needs.
0 ||| Bolero must rank as one of the worst major movies ever made. Many awful movies are at least funny in a campy sort of way. Bo and John Derek, however, make films so sincerely bad that they offer nothing in the way of relief.
0 ||| The one thing that the movie kills is time. It performs one miracle along the way by making an hour and a half turn into what must have been at least four.
0 ||| The promotional tagline for Bones fittingly reads, 'Unleash the Dogg.' The filmmakers sure did, and in more ways than one.
0 ||| To point out little flaws in this one would be like looking at a demolished car and complaining that the taillight doesn't work.
0 ||| Nothing sums up the film better than its parting shot, in which maggots are projectile vomited directly toward the audience.
0 ||| Bones wanted to be stylish but ended up being a waste of time.
0 ||| Boogeyman represents flat-out suckage. It is a haphazard assemblage of horror clichs, punctuated by the occasional so-loud-it-makes-you-jump noise on the soundtrack.
0 ||| boogey oogey awful
0 ||| Basically. it's 86 minutes of one man having a staring contest with a door.
0 ||| Will 2005 be remembered as the Year of the Awful Horror Movies?
0 ||| The problem is that Watson's performance is never interesting. It often seems as if he's not yet had his morning cup of coffee.
0 ||| So boring, derivative and patently inane that hate is entirely too strong an emotion to attribute to it. You're either in the target demographic or you're not.
0 ||| [Director] Holdermann must have been eager to make a comedy in the worst way. Unfortunately, that's exactly how it turned out.
0 ||| But once in a while I think it's only proper to admit defeat. And this time I know I'm beaten. If you want to see Book Club then fair play to you. Apparently you may well enjoy it. I truly have no idea why.
0 ||| One wonders what Berlinger's intentions were as he clearly didn't set out to make the simple scary movie everyone wants and expects.
0 ||| This film ranks on my personal lists of: Worst Sequels, Worst Movies, and Worst Examples of Film-making to Cash in on a Trend.
0 ||| Train wreck!
0 ||| You'd think Troy Duffy would have learned something in the decade since he blew his golden ticket with The Boondock Saints.
0 ||| Absolutely hilarious; Woods and Young all but claw the screen -- and each other
0 ||| Dreadful hardly seems to cover this film. BORAT is a barrage of is one stupid vulgarity after another.
0 ||| ...astonishingly infuriating for much of its absurdly overlong running time.
0 ||| It trivializes victim trauma by treating its main character's best-laid plans as punchline fodder.
0 ||| If you know someone who is thinking of putting their kid though one of these programs, buy them a ticket. If not, what's the point?
0 ||| While the actors desperately try to make something out of nothing, it's so terribly predictable and silly that audiences are more likely to have an occasional quiet chuckle than a scream - perhaps a more honest response is repeated yawning.
0 ||| Until its pair of ludicrous twist endings, which complicates its message and logistics in ways that make little sense, Gabe Torres's Brake plays like a more simplistic version of Buried tailored specifically to a hawkish right-wing crowd.
0 ||| Nothing more than a freshman's first term paper for a sociology 101.
0 ||| The storyline is almost too easy to rag on, what with its almost complete incoherence and dead-serious evocation of Mean Girls by way of McNamara's own Raise Your Voice.
0 ||| And I thought I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry was hypocritical.
0 ||| There isn't a moment of truth or perception in its miserable 98 minutes; this film's view of high school is so skewed from reality and so insulting in its contempt that it's almost scary to think preteen girls would fall for it.
0 ||| The girls in the live-action Bratz movie look less - what's the right word? - whorish than the dolls, but the lifestyle their movie is selling is no less disturbing.
0 ||| Parents of tween daughters everywhere beware: the brain rot that infects this movie might be contagious.
0 ||| [An] excruciatingly inane high-school comedy inspired by a line of sexually suggestive dolls aimed at 9-year-old girls.
0 ||| Bratz teems with jaw-dropping stereotypes even as it tries to throw a meager bone or two to intellectual achievement.
0 ||| O.M.G! This movie is SO BAD!
0 ||| If you ever wanted a movie to put in the time capsule so future generations can puzzle over the bankruptcy of our current kiddie culture, Bratz is it.
0 ||| ...if this isn't the most mind-numbingly idiotic movie made this century, it gives others something to shoot at.
0 ||| Everything about the movie exists in a hermetically sealed vacuum of stupidity.
0 ||| How do our flighty young heroines fight back? By shopping, of course. There is no problem, it seems, a new tube top and mini-skirt can't fix.
0 ||| How did this film get a theatrical release?
0 ||| This isn't "Bravetown." It's Crazytown.
0 ||| I would call the movie a trainwreck, except it's really four or five separate trainwrecks.
0 ||| What a waste of Union, who has been a good soldier in crap movies for a long time, obviously deserving a better opportunity than this to show us what she's made of.
0 ||| I find it hard to believe there will be a worse movie performance this year than the one Elise Schaap inflicts on us in the Dutch "Bride Flight."
0 ||| Bride Of Chucky, the fourth film in the Child's Play series, plays like an unfunny and corny parody of the first three films.
0 ||| Ed Wood sucked. He didn't suck so bad he was good, he just sucked.
0 ||| Bela was such a bad actor...
0 ||| One of the worst biopics I have ever seen, a leaden march through a chronology of Alma's affairs.
0 ||| Even at this early stage of the year, Bride Wars is certain to rank among the ten worst releases of 2009.
0 ||| It's like the Whack-a-Mole of everything reasonable people hate about so-called 'chick flicks.' [Blu-ray]
0 ||| reptilian, hateful stuff, biologically engineered to disrespect--with maximum efficiency--the precise demographic to which it targets itself.
0 ||| If you go with a group of friends to see Brideshead Revisited, the one who is still awake at the end wins a free dinner from the rest of the group.
0 ||| Apatow continues his assault on gentility and good taste with this roll in the gutter that degrades women. The sad part is that there is a good, sweet movie lurking here behind all the vulgarity.
0 ||| Something for the ignorant boors with the Y chromosome, something for the ignorant boors without it.
0 ||| Are women really as shallow as [this film] would have us believe?
0 ||| That old Hollywood standby, the venerable buddy cop movie, may have met its anguished demise this holiday season. Will Smith just killed it.
0 ||| Trolls the viewer and condescends to genre fans. A smirking, tone-deaf parable about racism that is itself racist, including about its made-up orcs and elves.
0 ||| Is this fan service? If so, for whom? Hannibal Lecter? Charles Manson?
0 ||| Superman, but he's evil. That's the whole movie. This is a depiction of violent entitled sociopathy that may think it's critiquing toxic masculinity yet is indistinguishable from a celebration of it.
0 ||| At its most unbearable [it] comes across as almost the platonic ideal of a Sundance "indie," toppling with riffs and notions that don't wholly play out, with central characters whose actions manage to be at once grotesque and milquetoast.
0 ||| Borders on being as offensive and misguided as a slapstick version of Roots.
0 ||| I'm ashamed that this movie exists, that people got paid for it and that someone out there will eventually add it to their DVD collection.
0 ||| It deserves to be buried in obscurity--if not burned beyond recognition--along with other comedies of its ilk, including Carbon Copy, He's My Girl, Soul Man and Chu-Chu and the Philly Flash.
0 ||| Why hasn't Spike Lee held a press conference about thing yet?
0 ||| I think it was after Betty White told Steve Martin's son not to "wear his hair like a ***" that I thought about walking out.
0 ||| Its portrayal of Britt-Marie sometimes feels condescending, several of its plot turns make no sense, and its visuals add nothing that wasn't already there in the original book.
0 ||| The terrible trio whine their way to a happy ending that is wholly undeserved.
0 ||| Absolutely nothing to recommend the film as anything other than a sagging collection of predictable clichs and brain-numbing boredom.
0 ||| Brooklyn's Finest is a cop movie so shallow, dumb, derivative and infuriating that it feels like a parody of bad cop movies.
0 ||| A quintessential example of a dishonest picture.
0 ||| The obvious motif of victory and power becomes the steroids to Brotherhood's raging physicality.
0 ||| If you are a long lost relative of the Grimm family, I encourage you to sue because Terry Gilliam has left a stain on your family's name that can't be erased with OxyClean.
0 ||| A disjointed, ear-splitting, visually-jarring, mirthless exercise in pandemonium that director Terry Gilliam tries to pass off as family entertainment.
0 ||| Dax Shepard delivers an I'm Still Here-style mockumentary of staggering incompetence with Brother's Justice.
0 ||| Not just horrid by itself, this opened the floodgates for all those self-absorbed indie "relationship" comedies of the latter 1990s.
0 ||| They should make Charles Manson and The Son of Sam watch this movie every single day of their lives until they feel sorry for what they have done.
0 ||| During the fallow opening minutes of The Brothers Solomon, I started keeping track of how much time would elapse before it made me laugh. Still waiting.
0 ||| A strong argument for birth control and 2007's worst comedy to date.
0 ||| Excruciatingly acted and ineptly directed.
0 ||| A readily-forgettable romantic comedy which, unfortunately, entirely fails to be funny along the way
0 ||| Wanna see a raunchy, hilarious adult comedy? Then by all means go to "Superbad," the not-so-surprise hit about being a teen-ager that's definitely for grownups.
0 ||| Less Oh, God! than Dear God.
0 ||| The dearth of imagination is stupefying. Carrey is alternately embarrassing and terrifyingly detached, [and] Freeman has sold out.
0 ||| Sacha Baron Cohen has nearly succeeded in his quest to be the film equivalent to Howard Stern. Crude and crass rather than challenging, shocking rather than stimulating, Cohen doesn't seem to care what he does so long as he gets people talking.
0 ||| Bruno is no Borat!
0 ||| Moronic, racist, embarrassing.
0 ||| Bubble Boy's producers should never be allowed to SEE another film, let alone make one.
0 ||| Certainly the meanest-spirited film ever associated with the Disney hallmark.
0 ||| The ultimate cinematic bafflement, one that will leave the most jaded Hollywood observer with a Freddie Prinze Jr.-like look of bug-eyed, slack-jawed shock.
0 ||| Calling the picture an insult to the immune deficiency syndrome is inappropriate; however, calling the movie an act of pure idiocy is bordering generosity.
0 ||| Rob Reiner's films have always aimed for a heartwarming effect and more frequently resulted in heartworm.
0 ||| Justin Zackham's screenplay should be the first to be banned from writing classes everywhere let alone hospitals and support groups.
0 ||| That Morgan Freeman is one narratin' son of a gun.
0 ||| This may be the worst movie Pauly Shore has ever been in. Think about that. If you dare, go on Netflix and test the hypothesis.
0 ||| If you took this script to any sane film producer, they would assume you were pulling a prank. When you told them the shockingly untalented Nick Swardson was attached as the lead, they'd call security.
0 ||| The worst Saturday Night Live sketch movie ever made that was never actually a Saturday Night Live sketch.
0 ||| All involved will be known as those who took part in the worst movie of the year
0 ||| Nothing to see here, kids.
0 ||| Don't put yourself through this train wreck of a movie. Unless of course you enjoy feeling like the screenwriter is hovering at your elbow during the film screaming "GET IT?!" after every joke.
0 ||| I go take seven aspirin for my current headache, I do need to let you know that there's a whole other actually funny movie going on inside this one, struggling to come out.
0 ||| Putrid and completely unfunny, 'Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star' is a torturous exercise for a viewer. I can't count the times I wanted to walk out of this ghastly excuse for a movie. Still, I stayed with it. I just couldn't bring myself to leave.
0 ||| Unfortunately, the bottom line is that it's tedious and pointless. Better luck next time.
0 ||| "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" ultimately falls prey to the worst tendencies of horror and teen pictures.
0 ||| Malkovich has built a career mumbling his way through one disastrous movie after another, but this time he's got company.
0 ||| Most of it makes you laugh when it shouldn't be
0 ||| Strictly vacuous and insulting.
0 ||| This film is shot full of holes.
0 ||| Not to put too fine a point on it, but "Bulletproof Monk" is a rather large piece of garbage.
0 ||| Some of his detractors have called Mr. Clark a pornographer, but this is an insult to honest smut-peddlers, who treat their subjects with more respect than he does.
0 ||| A truly repulsive piece of trash that says far more about the absence of values from contemporary filmmaking than the waywardness of teens.
0 ||| If the film's plot had been based on Shakespearean literature, the movie still would have been displeasing...
0 ||| Jaw-droppingly abysmal. Seldom has a major star embarrassed himself so badly.
0 ||| Completely pointless and utterly unwatchable...
0 ||| A mega mash-up in the vein of Sucker Punch, Bunraku jumbles together elements with a self-consciousness that's as turgid as its story proper.
0 ||| This is a music video; an ego piece for two fading stars that is one of the most creatively bankrupt pieces of cinema in years. Actually, most music videos are better.
0 ||| The movie is an affront to all things screenwriting; a package of empty envelopes at the cliche factory that actually should have every cliche filing a class action lawsuit to stop the film from using their likeness.
0 ||| Burlesque manages what seemed impossible: It is filled with half-naked dancing girls, yet it's still boring.
0 ||| Evinces enough hatred of mankind to make Todd Solondz look like a dedicated humanist.
0 ||| A monotonous, suffocating experience with no payoff or purpose, other than noting bad decisions have consequences and pain lasts a long time.
0 ||| A missed opportunity in just about every way.
0 ||| ...clumsily lurches from one irrelevant, uninteresting episode to the next...
0 ||| Gruesome and atrocious, Butcher Boys is an awful film that you don't ever want to sink your teeth into.
0 ||| Even by the lax standards of January film releases -- this month is the traditional dumping time for studio films that didn't quite work out -- The Butterfly Effect is staggeringly bad.
0 ||| Ultimately just feels like a mess, screeching back and forth in time, dragging its actors from one miserable scene to another.
0 ||| When it's all said and done, there comes a not half-bad twist. But by this time, we've endured too many reprises of canine flamb, + Eric Stoltz as a drooling pervert.
0 ||| Dude, where's my memory?
0 ||| Wasted Talent - Wasted Time
0 ||| In the end, there's little else to say, this new Cabin Fever a bloody misfire that shouldn't even exist in the first place.
0 ||| dependant almost entirely--when it's not being angry and cynical--on arrogance and smugness.
0 ||| Should have put the gopher to work on the script.
0 ||| Hideous.
0 ||| The original was no great shakes, but this is beyond bad.
0 ||| Jean-Marc Valle deploys a pretty sweeping arsenal of clichs in shoving his camera through the characters' streams of consciousness.
0 ||| Offensive, stupid, and embarrassing.
0 ||| The worst picture of the year ... If there had been rotten tomatoes in our theater, I am certain the screen would have been blood red by the end.
0 ||| The only thing horrifying in Joel Soisson's techno born thriller Cam2Cam is the awful grammatical chatroom communication utilized by its sublimely half-witted characters.
0 ||| Real-world drama campers (and former drama campers) may just delight in this 'wacky' teenage soap opera, but the rest will be more likely to seek out the underside of a speeding truck to stop the madness once and for all.
0 ||| Most of the enduring grindhouse movies lose the residue of sweaty misanthropy through the simple, inevitable obsolescence of their hard-candied centers of shock value.
0 ||| Cannonball Run II is one of the laziest insults to the intelligence of moviegoers that I can remember. Sheer arrogance made this picture.
0 ||| Directionless sequel that once again proves that the pictures that are the most fun to make aren't necessarily the most fun to watch.
0 ||| The movie is a genuine cultural artifact, a relic given to us by a band of entertainers from long ago, who live in self-imposed exile in the dusty, neon hellhole of Las Vegas.
0 ||| It doesn't have a thought in its head and probably no notion of the corruption at its core.
0 ||| This botched affair... goes absolutely nowhere and failed to cause much of a stir with moviegoers who, by the time of its release, were jumping on the disco backlash bandwagon.
0 ||| Homophobia in Muslim families and communities is a topic ripe for exploration, but as its eye-rollingly lame titular pun makes clear, I Can't Think Straight isn't the film to do it.
0 ||| Tom Hardy is a terrific actor. However, Capone is easily the worst performance of his career. This movie is so bad...
0 ||| We began this dismal movie season with one lethally bad World War II romance -- Pearl Harbor -- and now we're wrapping up with another howling dog, Captain Corelli's Mandolin.
0 ||| The one-joke soon wears thin, and nothing - particularly the labor-saving animation and hideous-to-behold character design - can keep Underpants from stinking.
0 ||| A spirit-sapping exercise in female degradation fantasy.
0 ||| ...so ineptly conceived and staged it could be the first torture-porn comedy
0 ||| I never thought I'd say this, but this movie gives torture porn a bad name.
0 ||| If this is Cuthbert's idea of being, as she claims, choosy about the horror offers she accepts, heaven help us from the ones she's turned down.
0 ||| No real setup, minimal explanation as to why it's happening.
0 ||| Rarely have I found myself so uncomfortable viewing anything over such an extended period of time. There's nothing redeemable here. It's not tense or scary; it's just demented.
0 ||| Captivity the movie has been thoroughly eclipsed by Captivity the marketing.
0 ||| Once in a while, mainstream America is exposed to a movie for which there is no earthly purpose.
0 ||| A poseur Grand Guignol, artistically indefensible and rank without purpose.
0 ||| Captivity is the kind of film that gives torture porn a bad name. It's disturbing in the most unpleasant ways possible outside of Abu Ghraib or battlefield snuff films.
0 ||| Even in the fetid swamp of the torture porn genre, it stands out as a particularly awful movie.
0 ||| The only smart move made by the filmmakers was casting Pruitt Taylor Vince as the torturer. Too bad you only get to see his face for a coupla minutes. Man, that's one freaky-lookin' dude.
0 ||| What a loathsome, reckless and sickening glimpse into madness this is.
0 ||| Aside from the interminable music videos, set to a constant, very loud Top-40 soundtrack, much of the film is so surrealistic and weird that you may think certain scenes are meant to be of daydreams.
0 ||| Plays like a painfully stilted high school production of "Fatal Attraction."
0 ||| A climax so dark you'll need braille subtitles to get through it.
0 ||| A rather inane and dull family comedy, Carpool is merely a bundle of chase cliches surrounded by unappealing characters.
0 ||| I was expecting passive mediocrity. Instead, I got something actively bad.
0 ||| The film is essentially an exercise in forcing a female genius back into her proper place of dependence on both the father figure and the Prince Charming.
0 ||| As appalling as any motion picture released so far in 2011. Ruthlessly betrays every last thing the original so passionately stood for.
0 ||| The film simply mucks up its earnest take on the buddy movie with undercooked characters and on-the-nose writing.
0 ||| This is one of those nasty little films that tries very hard to obscure its misogynist and racist premise through pseudo political critique.
0 ||| This is one of those pictures, alas, that is critic-proof merely by dint of the fact that applying any amount of thought to it, superficial, or serious, or what have you, is an entirely humiliating,
0 ||| Racist, repetitive and ridiculous - unless you're a devoted fan of Spanish telenovas.
0 ||| ...a consistently disastrous and aggressively unwatchable cinematic endurance...
0 ||| Its time to put the nail in the otherworldly evil child genre until someone comes up with something original. The only thing supernatural about Case 39 is its ungodly presence on this planet.
0 ||| Offers such a 13-year-old boy's perspective on love and sex that you wouldn't even trust it to unhook a bra.
0 ||| ...focuses on a pervert who thinks he's a romantic. The more sincere this guy gets about his leering, the more he creeps you out.
0 ||| Taking place in a scary netherworld where up is down, black is white, and Steve Guttenberg, Rodney Dangerfield, Lori Loughlin, Pauly Shore, and Richard Moll still have careers.
0 ||| It takes cinematic magic to entrance a child. There's nothing magical about this movie. I began wondering if the producers set out to torture their family audience.
0 ||| I don't remember a rave scene with a cameo by hoochy hotel heiress Paris Hilton in Dr. Seuss's The Cat in the Hat, do you?
0 ||| Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat is perhaps the worst holiday movie ever made.
0 ||| Abandon hope all ye who enter.
0 ||| In a word; awful.
0 ||| Represents everything corrupt, bloated, and wrong with mainstream Hollywood movies.
0 ||| Too stupid for grown-ups, too gross for the tots, / the movie was really upsetting me -- lots.
0 ||| It's a noisy nightmare, a hugely impersonal, manufactured product. It shows not only a complete disregard for children, but also utter contempt.
0 ||| Even at an embarrassingly short 82 minutes, Cat is stuffed with inane filler.
0 ||| A film adaptation with big-buck effects, but no soul to speak of.
0 ||| ... a shrill, soulless and disturbing void of imagination that murders the spirit of a beloved children's book -- which the filmmakers obviously have not read.
0 ||| It's so bad that Dr. Seuss should sue from the grave ... It is one of longest eighty minutes you'll ever spend in a theater.
0 ||| Ever catch a family member sniffing your underwear? I haven't either, but I suspect it feels something like how I felt leaving the theatre...Argh!
0 ||| Unless you are prone to laugh at endless urination, expectoration, regurgitation, defecation, flatulence, and belching, avoid this rip-off at all costs.
0 ||| The chick comedy-drama Catch and Release may look bland, but it's not. It's worse. To rise to the level of blandness, it would need to have a few gallons of Tabasco dumped into it.
0 ||| Ugh.
0 ||| ...harbours a secret crush on Gray but, hey, so does everybody, since Gray has fairies and butterflies flying out of her vagina.
0 ||| Not witty enough to be a comedy and not well-plotted enough to be taken seriously, with flat performances and lackluster direction, it's a serious yawner
0 ||| Freundlich ... directs his first big studio film on autopilot, trudging through the motions and displaying little understanding of what appeals to young 'uns.
0 ||| For the life of me, I cannot determine, calculate, or even divine what this movie is, what purpose it serves, and what line of thinking brought it to life.
0 ||| This all-star, all-awful screen take on the smash Broadway musical easily scores as the worst movie of the year and arguably the decade. Cats shouldn't happen to a dog.
0 ||| Oh God, my eyes.
0 ||| First off, full disclosure -- I am not a cat person. Second off -- after watching this frankly mortifying film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats, I'm not altogether sure I am a movie person anymore either.
0 ||| Finding any high point in Cats, though, takes some serious scratching.
0 ||| Hooper is not my man for film musicals.
0 ||| As far as motion picture musicals are concerned, Cats is...a cinematic disgrace.
0 ||| This adaptation gets straight to the heart of the material, which is basically two hours of stray cats introducing themselves.
0 ||| Visually repulsive and not far behind on a sonic level.
0 ||| Where do you even start with Cats? Tom Hooper's big screen version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical is unlike anything you've ever seen before, but not in a good way.
0 ||| The worst thing about Cats - and I was forced to see two cat burglars sensually drape a string of pearls around the scruff of Hayward in the obvious foray to a cat threesome - is that it was made in the first place.
0 ||| A borderline unwatchable mishmash of poorly conceived musical numbers and incoherent storytelling.
0 ||| It is a movie that never stops throwing 50 shades of WTF at you, but never once starts making sense.
0 ||| Inscrutable and ignominious - a veritable cat-astrophe!
0 ||| One of the biggest misfires I've ever seen on the big screen. [Full review in Spanish]
0 ||| The worst movie I have seen in my lifetime...the movie is oddly over-sexualized and the music is not moving...what was going on?
0 ||| A film that seeks to inspire our loathing for nearly every frame it sits on the screen, and that is before we even attempt to decipher the mediocrity that is the music or the nonexistence of the story.
0 ||| Every ounce of goodwill built by the feline community in this economy of viral cat videos and memes has been squandered by a single movie.
0 ||| Dragging on for almost two hours of poor singing and predominantly forgettable choreography, Cats is Hooper's way of maliciously toying with us like a half-dead mouse wishing for sweet release.
0 ||| Like all unimaginative filmmakers that don't know what to do with 3D technology, director Brad Peyton subordinates all action in the movie to the tech he's working with.
0 ||| The 3D conversion is awful. The special effects are awful. The acting is awful. The movie is awful. Stay away from this movie.
0 ||| Let me be direct about this: I gave "this a half-star because it contains cute animals and, at the end, there are entertaining clips of animals that aren't in the movie.
0 ||| A dog's breakfast.
0 ||| It's bad enough that not only are careers over, but somebody should be slapped.
0 ||| Catwoman is not destined to have nine lives.
0 ||| She can do everything a Spider-Man can, but worse. Much, much, much, much worse.
0 ||| Halle Berry's Catwoman is a dog. And no amount of tight black leather outfits, nauseating CGI effects and good-looking actors and actresses is going to change that.
0 ||| If Halle Berry keeps this up, she's going to have to give that Oscar back.
0 ||| You gotta be kidding me.
0 ||| The summer that gave us what is arguably the best comic book movie of all time -- Spider-Man 2 -- has now choked up what is arguably the worst.
0 ||| Every odorous frame before and after [the 'outfit'] can be safely consigned to the litter box.
0 ||| ...makes me long for the quiet dignity of Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance in 'Batman and Robin.'
0 ||| Utterly devoid of merit, fantastic or otherwise, a more exasperating descent into the feline world is difficult to imagine.
0 ||| this flick is so Giglicious ... I laughed so much I almost forgave Pitof for being in heat and spraying this cinematic violation all over DC's trademark vixen
0 ||| ...a monumental waste of your time to see.
0 ||| She stands on ledges, peering at all the buildings, or at the moon ... she might be hoping one of those places holds a better script.
0 ||| I'm pretty sure an actual cat could have made a better film.
0 ||| [Provides] a safety net for every person who ever directs a superhero movie for the rest of time: "Well, that completely sucked, but it was no Catwoman".
0 ||| If you want to see a real Catwoman, check out Michelle Pfeiffer's turn in Batman Returns, but whatever you do, leave this kitty cat in the alley where it belongs.
0 ||| it isn't just tedious, it isn't just silly, no, it goes the distance until it actually becomes a personal affront to the sensibilities of everyone concerned
0 ||| Director Bruce Hunt shouldn't be allowed to film a birthday party, let alone a major motion picture.
0 ||| A turd held up to the flickering bulb of the projector would be a marked improvement.
0 ||| A claustrophobic horror film that provides nothing original beyond its underground setting.
0 ||| Most everyone in the audience, except those rendered unconscious by boredom, will see the 'big twist' plot turn coming well in advance, although the qualifiers 'big' and 'twist' seem overblown and inexact.
0 ||| The Cave is a rare find, a film that is pure formula, yet impossible to follow.
0 ||| Forgettable.
0 ||| ...a dull, thoroughly unpleasant horror flick...
0 ||| These are icons, not accessories in some Hot Topic cover version of "Teenage Lobotomy."
